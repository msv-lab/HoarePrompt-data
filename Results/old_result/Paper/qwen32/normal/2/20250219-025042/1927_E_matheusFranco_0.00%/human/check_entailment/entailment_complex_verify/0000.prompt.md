You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v

            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])

        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., n` distributed according to the pattern described above; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n+1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last index filled in the final iteration.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the space-separated concatenation of the elements in the permutation list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even. It constructs a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` following a specific pattern based on the value of `k`. The constructed permutation is then printed as a space-separated string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the given function signature alone.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user to input an integer `t`, then repeatedly calls `func_1` until `t` becomes 0. It does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; instead, it performs actions based on the internal logic within `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n. A k-level permutation is defined such that among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Generates a permutation for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

#### Function `func_1()`:
- Reads `n` and `k` from input.
- Initializes an array `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
- Fills the array in a pattern where elements are placed at positions that are multiples of `k` plus an offset `i`.
- Prints the resulting permutation.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Pattern of Permutation**: The current pattern used in `func_1()` may not guarantee that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `n == k` or when `k` is close to `n`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input**: `2 2`
   - Expected Output: `2 1` or `1 2` (both valid)
   - Actual Output: `1 2` (valid)

2. **Input**: `3 2`
   - Expected Output: `1 3 2` or any other valid permutation
   - Actual Output: `1 0 2` (invalid, as `0` is not allowed)

3. **Input**: `10 4`
   - Expected Output: Any valid k-level permutation
   - Actual Output: `1 5 9 0 2 6 10 0 3 7` (invalid, as `0` is not allowed)

4. **Input**: `13 4`
   - Expected Output: Any valid k-level permutation
   - Actual Output: `1 5 9 0 2 6 10 0 3 7 0 11 0` (invalid, as `0` is not allowed)

5. **Input**: `7 4`
   - Expected Output: Any valid k-level permutation
   - Actual Output: `1 5 9 0 2 6 0` (invalid, as `0` is not allowed)

### Conclusion:
The program does not generate valid permutations because it uses `0` as a placeholder, which is not allowed according to the problem description. Additionally, the pattern used does not guarantee that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly uses `0` as a placeholder in the permutation, which is not allowed. Furthermore, the pattern used to fill the permutation does not ensure that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, as demonstrated by the invalid outputs for the test cases.
