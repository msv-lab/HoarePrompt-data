To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given information:

- The loop condition is `while t > 0`.
- Inside the loop, `func_1()` is called, and then `t` is decremented by 1 (`t -= 1`).

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1.
- After 2 iterations, `t` was initially at least 1.
- After 3 iterations, `t` was initially at least 2 (since it had to be at least 3 before decrementing three times).

The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `t` becomes 0.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0.

Output State: **t is 0.**

In natural language, this means that once the loop has run all its iterations, the variable `t` will have been decremented down to 0, and the loop will stop executing because the condition `t > 0` will no longer be true.
