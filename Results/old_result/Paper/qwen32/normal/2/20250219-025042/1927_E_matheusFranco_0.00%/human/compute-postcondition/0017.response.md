Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` set to 3, and all other elements initialized to 0; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be such that `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < n`.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables retain their initial values.
