The code snippet increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. Given the initial state, `curr_v` is initially `m+m+2`. After the increment, `curr_v` becomes `m+m+3`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively except that `permutation[1]` is `m+m+2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1; `i` is 1.**
