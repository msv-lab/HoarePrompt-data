### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\),
- \(1 \le b \le m\),
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\). This implies:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Given this, let's analyze the provided program.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and calculates the number of valid pairs for each test case using the following logic:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
The annotations indicate the state of the program at various points:
- Before the function call: `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`.
- Inside the loop for each test case: `suma` accumulates the count of valid pairs based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
The original assessment tested the program against several test cases, and the program produced the expected results. Let's re-evaluate these test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`
   
2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: `3`
   
3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4`
   
4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `10 8`
   - Expected Output: `14`
   - Program Output: `14`
   
5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `100 1233`
   - Expected Output: `153`
   - Program Output: `153`
   
6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `1000000 1145141`
   - Expected Output: `1643498`
   - Program Output: `1643498`

All test cases pass, which suggests the program is likely correct.

#### Mathematical Insight:
The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be derived from counting the number of valid `a` values for each `b` that satisfy the condition. The term `i` represents `b`, and the formula ensures that `a` is counted correctly based on the multiples of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the problem, the provided program, and the verification against multiple test cases, the program appears to be correct. There are no apparent logical errors or issues in the implementation.

**Final: True**
