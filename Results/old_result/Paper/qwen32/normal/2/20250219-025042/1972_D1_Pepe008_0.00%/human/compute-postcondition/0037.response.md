Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State: 
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `b` remains the same
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i + 1)) // (i + 1)`
- `suma` is updated by adding `x` to it

Now, let's apply the code snippet:
```python
suma += x
```

This line adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Since `x` is already defined as `(a - i * (i + 1)) // (i + 1)`, the new value of `suma` will be the old value of `suma` plus this expression.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (remains the same in terms of its new value being used in future calculations)
- `b` remains the same
- `x` is `(a - i * (i + 1)) // (i + 1)` (this is the value before the increment of `i`)
- `suma` is updated to its previous value plus `x`

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `b` remains the same; `x` is `(a - i * (i + 1)) // (i + 1)`; `suma` is updated to its previous value plus `x`.**
