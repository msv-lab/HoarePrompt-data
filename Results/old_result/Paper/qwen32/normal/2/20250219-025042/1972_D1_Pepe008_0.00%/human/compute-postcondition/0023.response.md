The given code snippet assigns the integer values from the first two elements of the `info` list to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated under certain conditions, `t` is incremented by 1, and `info` is a list of strings.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integer values of the first two elements of `info`. The values of `suma` and `t` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this particular code snippet. The `info` list remains the same as well since no modifications are made to it.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, with `i` ranging from 1 to `b`; `t` is incremented by 1; `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**
