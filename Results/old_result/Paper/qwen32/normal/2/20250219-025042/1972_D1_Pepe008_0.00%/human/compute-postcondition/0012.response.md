Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `suma` is recalculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged, `x` is recalculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is now calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
