The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The value of `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line.**
