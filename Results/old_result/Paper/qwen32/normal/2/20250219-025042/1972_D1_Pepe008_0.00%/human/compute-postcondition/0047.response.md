To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x` using the given initial state.

Given:
- `suma` is 0
- `t` is `t + 1` (Note: This seems to be an incorrect statement as `t` should have an initial value to be incremented)
- `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 0

The expression for `x` is:
```
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `i` is a predefined integer, let's proceed with the calculation using `i` as a placeholder.

The output state will include the calculated value of `x` and the unchanged values of `suma`, `t`, `info`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is `t + 1`, `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, while `suma`, `t`, `info`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values.
