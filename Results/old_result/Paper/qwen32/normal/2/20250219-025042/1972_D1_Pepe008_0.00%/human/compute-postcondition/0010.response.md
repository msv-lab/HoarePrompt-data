Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is not greater than 0, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.**
