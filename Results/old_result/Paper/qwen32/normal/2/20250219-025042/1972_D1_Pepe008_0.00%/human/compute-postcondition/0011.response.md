To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and `b` is known to be at least 1.

Let's analyze the state adjustments required:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Variable `b`:**
   - `b` does not change within the loop; it remains constant throughout all iterations.
   - Hence, `b` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Since `suma` and `x` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head's requirements. However, for completeness, we can describe how they would be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
- `info` is a list of strings.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
- `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged.
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `b` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `suma` is recalculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` remains unchanged, `x` is recalculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
