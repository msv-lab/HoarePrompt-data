Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4. Each of the next T lines contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    """for i in range(1,a+1):
        for j in range(4,b+1):
            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                print(i,j)"""
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
            suma += x
    print(suma - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, with `i` ranging from 1 to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `suma` is the accumulated sum of all `x` values where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for `i` from 1 to `b`. `t` is incremented by 1, `info` remains the list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `suma` is `S`, `t` is `t + 1`, `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
