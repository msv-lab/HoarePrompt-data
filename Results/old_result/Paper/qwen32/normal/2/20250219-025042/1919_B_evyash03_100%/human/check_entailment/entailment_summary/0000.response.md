### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (length of the string) and a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-'.
2. **Conversion**: The string `s` is converted into an array `a` where each '+' becomes `1` and each '-' becomes `-1`.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The goal is to split this array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
4. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output the minimum possible penalty.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code does not actually implement the optimal splitting logic described in the problem statement. Instead, it calculates and returns the absolute difference between the length of the input string and twice the number of '+' characters in the string.

Here's what the code does:
- It counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
- It calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' from the total length of the string.
- It returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters.

This approach does not consider any splitting strategy and does not compute the penalties as described in the problem statement. Therefore, it cannot produce the correct minimum penalty for the given input.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify with one of the examples provided:
- **Test Case 3**: Input string is `+-+-+-`. The correct optimal split is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`. However, the code would calculate `|3 - 3| = 0`, which coincidentally matches the correct answer but for the wrong reasons.

Since the code does not implement the required logic for optimal splitting and penalty calculation, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
