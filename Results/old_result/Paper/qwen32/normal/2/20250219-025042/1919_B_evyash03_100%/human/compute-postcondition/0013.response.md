Given the initial state, `count` represents the number of '+' characters in the expression string, and `sub` is calculated as `length - count`. The return statement computes `abs(sub - count)`.

To determine the output, let's break down the expression:

- `sub` is defined as `length - count`.
- Therefore, `sub - count` simplifies to `(length - count) - count`, which equals `length - 2*count`.
- The absolute value function `abs()` ensures the result is non-negative.

Thus, the returned value is `abs(length - 2*count)`.

Output State: **The program returns the absolute value of (length - 2 * count)**.
