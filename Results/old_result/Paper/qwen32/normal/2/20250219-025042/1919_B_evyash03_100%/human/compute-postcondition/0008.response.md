To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `char` and `expression`. The variable `length` is derived from `expression`, and `count` is determined by the value of `char`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character.
- `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000.
- `char` is the next character in `expression` to be processed.
- `count` is 2 if `char` was '+', otherwise `count` is 1.

In the for loop:
```python
for char in expression:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates over each character in `expression`. After processing the current `char`, the loop will automatically move to the next character in `expression`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Adjust `char`:** At the start of the next iteration, `char` should be the next character in `expression` that hasn't been processed yet. Since the loop automatically advances `char` to the next character, we don't need to manually adjust it; it will naturally point to the next character.

2. **Adjust `length`:** The length of `expression` does not change during the loop, so `length` remains the same.

3. **Adjust `count`:** The value of `count` is determined by the new value of `char`. If the new `char` is '+', `count` should be set to 2. If the new `char` is '-', `count` should be set to 1.

### Final State:

Since `char` is automatically updated by the loop, we only need to ensure that `count` reflects the new value of `char`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `char` is the next character in `expression` to be processed, `count` is 2 if `char` is '+', otherwise `count` is 1.**

However, since `char` is automatically updated, we can simply state:

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `char` is the next character in `expression` to be processed, `count` is determined by the new value of `char` (2 if `char` is '+', otherwise 1).**
