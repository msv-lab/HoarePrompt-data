### Reasoning:

The provided program and its function `func_1` do not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The function calculates and returns the absolute difference between the length of the input string `expression` and twice the number of '+' characters in the string. This approach does not account for optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

To understand why the original assessment is correct, let's analyze the logic and the examples provided:

1. **Third Example Analysis:**
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: The optimal way to split the array `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` is into two subarrays `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`. Both subarrays have a sum of 0, so their penalties are `|0| * 4 = 0` and `|0| * 2 = 0`, respectively. Therefore, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.
   
   While the program does return `0` for this specific case, this is not due to correct logic but rather a coincidence.

2. **Another Example Analysis:**
   - Input: `--+++`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The optimal way to split the array `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1]` is into two subarrays `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])`. The penalties are `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, respectively. However, a better split is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [-1, 1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is actually `([-1], [1, -1, 1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 1 = 1` and `|2| * 4 = 8`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`, but the best is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1])` giving `|-2| * 2 = 4` and `|3| * 3 = 9`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1], [1, 1])` giving `|-1| * 3 = 3` and `|2| * 2 = 4`, but the best is `([-1, -1, 1, 1], [1])` giving `|1| * 4 = 4` and `|1| * 1 = 1`.

   The program does not consider these splits and their respective penalties. It only computes the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not guarantee an optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` does not account for optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
