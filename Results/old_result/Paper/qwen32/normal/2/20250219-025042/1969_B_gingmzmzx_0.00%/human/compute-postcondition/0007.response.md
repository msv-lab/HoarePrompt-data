The given code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` of the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` is initialized as `[0, 0]`, this operation will increase either the first or second element of `cnt` by 1, depending on the value of `c`. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine which element of `cnt` will be incremented. However, we know that `c` must be either 0 or 1 because the elements of the list `s` are either 0 or 1, and `c` is likely derived from an element of `s`.

Given the constraints, let's assume `c` can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is 0**. This means that either the first or the second element of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, depending on the value of `c`.
