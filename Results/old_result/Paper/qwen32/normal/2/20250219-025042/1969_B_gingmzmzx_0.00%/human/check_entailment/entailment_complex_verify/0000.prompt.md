You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t remains the same, n becomes 0, cnt contains the total counts of 0s and 1s, ans contains the accumulated result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. For each binary string, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and the substring `s[i:j+1]` contains at least one '0' and one '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem involves finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string `s`. It calculates the minimum cost required to sort each string using the following approach:

1. Count the number of zeros in the string.
2. Initialize a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the counts of '0' and '1'.
3. Iterate through the string and update the counter array.
4. For each character in the string:
   - If the character is '0', increment the answer by 1 if there has been at least one '1' encountered before.
   - If the character is '1', increment the answer by the number of remaining zeros (total zeros minus the count of zeros encountered so far).
5. Print the calculated answer for each test case.

### Potential Issues
The provided program seems to follow a logical approach but let's verify it against the problem description and the provided examples.

       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - Output: `1` (Incorrect)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `0000`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Calculation:
     - Zeroes: 4
     - Iteration:
       - All characters are '0', no increment in `ans`.
     - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `11000`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Calculation:
     - Zeroes: 3

       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 0`
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 4` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 6` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - Output: `6` (Incorrect)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `101011`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Calculation:
     - Zeroes: 3
     - Iteration:
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 1`
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 3` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 3`
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 4]`, `ans = 3`
     - Output: `3` (Incorrect)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `01101001`
   - Expected Output: `11`
   - Calculation:
     - Zeroes: 4
     - Iteration:
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0`
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 0`
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 0`
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 2`
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 3]`, `ans = 5` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
       - `c = 0`: `cnt = [4, 3]`, `ans = 8` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
       - `c = 1`: `cnt = [4, 4]`, `ans = 8`
     - Output: `8` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion
The program does not produce the correct output for several test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**

### Explanation
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. It fails to account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts accurately. The logic used in the program does not align with the problem's requirement of calculating the cost based on the length of the substring being shifted.
