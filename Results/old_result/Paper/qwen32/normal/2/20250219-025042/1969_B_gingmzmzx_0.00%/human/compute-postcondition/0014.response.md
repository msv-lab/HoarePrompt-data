The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the element in the list `cnt` at the index specified by the value of `c` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s` and each element in `s` is either 0 or 1, `c` can only be 0 or 1.

- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

Since `cnt` is initially either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, the increment operation will adjust the count accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is adjusted by incrementing `cnt[c]` by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**

In simpler terms, the count of the current element `c` (which is either 0 or 1) in the list `cnt` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged except for `cnt`.
