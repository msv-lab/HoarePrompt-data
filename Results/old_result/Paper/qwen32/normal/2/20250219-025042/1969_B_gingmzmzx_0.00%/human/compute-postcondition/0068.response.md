Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0 or `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` (the count of 1s encountered so far) is greater than 0. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described.
