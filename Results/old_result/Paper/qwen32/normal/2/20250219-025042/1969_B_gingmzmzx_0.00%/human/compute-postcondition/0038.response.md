The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the element in the list `cnt` at the index specified by the value of `c` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s` and each element in `s` is either 0 or 1, this operation will increase either the first or the second element of `cnt` by 1.

Since `cnt` is initially either `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, and `c` is either 0 or 1, the resulting `cnt` will be one of the following:
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` will become `[1, 1]` if it was `[0, 1]` initially, or `[2, 0]` if it was `[1, 0]` initially.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` will become `[0, 2]` if it was `[0, 1]` initially, or `[1, 1]` if it was `[1, 0]` initially.

The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 1]`, `[2, 0]`, or `[0, 2]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
