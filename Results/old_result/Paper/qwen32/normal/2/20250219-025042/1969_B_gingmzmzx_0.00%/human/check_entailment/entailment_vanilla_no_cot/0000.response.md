Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shifts. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to count certain transitions or inversions, but it does not account for the actual cost of performing the cyclic shifts as described in the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider how to move all `1`s to the end of the string with the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. A more appropriate approach would involve counting the number of `1`s that need to be moved past each `0` encountered as we iterate through the string, which aligns with the cost calculation required by the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = input().strip()
        ones_count = 0
        cost = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == '1':
                ones_count += 1
            elif c == '0' and ones_count > 0:
                cost += ones_count
        print(cost)

func_1()
```

This corrected program iterates through the string, counts the number of `1`s encountered, and adds that count to the total cost whenever a `0` is encountered after `1`s. This correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string as required by the problem.
