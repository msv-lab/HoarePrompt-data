The code snippet sets `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, or `cnt`. The only change is that `ans` is now explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**
