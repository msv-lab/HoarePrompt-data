The given code snippet increments the variable `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` (the count of 1s in the list `s`) is greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that will be affected by this line of code is `ans`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `cnt` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is adjusted by incrementing `cnt[c]` by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` > 0 else `ans` remains unchanged.**
