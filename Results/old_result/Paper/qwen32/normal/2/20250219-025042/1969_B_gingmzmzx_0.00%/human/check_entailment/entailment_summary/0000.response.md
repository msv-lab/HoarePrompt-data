### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The given code instead counts the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` in the string where `i < j` and the substring `s[i:j+1]` contains both '0' and '1'. This count does not represent the minimum cost required to sort the string.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it converts the binary string into a list of integers.
- It counts the number of '0's in the string.
- It iterates through the string, maintaining a count of '0's and '1's encountered so far (`cnt`).
- For each character in the string:
  - If the character is '0', it adds 1 to `ans` if there has been at least one '1' seen before.
  - If the character is '1', it adds the number of remaining '0's (total '0's minus the count of '0's seen so far) to `ans`.

This approach does not calculate the minimum cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it counts certain pairs, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
