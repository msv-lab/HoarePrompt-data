The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. 

Here's the breakdown:
- `zeroes` represents the count of 0s in the list `s`.
- `cnt[0]` keeps track of the number of 0s encountered so far while processing elements in `s`.

After executing the line `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]`, the value of `ans` will be updated accordingly.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `cnt`, and `c`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0 or `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` following the previously processed element, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
