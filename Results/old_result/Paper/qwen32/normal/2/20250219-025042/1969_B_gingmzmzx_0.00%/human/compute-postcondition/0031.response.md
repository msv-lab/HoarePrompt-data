The given code snippet increments the value at index `c` of the list `cnt` by 1. Since the value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine which element of `cnt` will be incremented. However, we know that `cnt` is initially `[0, 0]`. After the increment, one of the elements in `cnt` will be 1, and the other will remain 0.

Given that `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans` are not modified by the code snippet, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 1] or [1, 0], `ans` is 0**. One of the elements in `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it 1, while the other remains 0.
