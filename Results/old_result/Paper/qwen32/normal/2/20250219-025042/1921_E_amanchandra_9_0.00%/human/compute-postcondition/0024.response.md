The value of `r` is assigned the minimum between `w` and `yb + x`. Given the initial state, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)` and `r` is calculated accordingly. The values of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`, `r` is `min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`**
