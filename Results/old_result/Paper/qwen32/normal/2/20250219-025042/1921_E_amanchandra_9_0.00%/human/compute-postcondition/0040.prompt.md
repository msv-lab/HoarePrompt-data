Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the next t lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
    if xa > xb:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
        if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
            l = max(1, yb - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r -
                ya) <= x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, ya - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, then no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is set to the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `yb` minus `x`; otherwise, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `ya` minus `x`. In both cases, `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `yb` plus `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input. If `xa > xb`, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true (i.e., `abs(xa - xb)` is odd), then `l` is `max(1, yb - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))` and `r` is `min(w, yb + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`. Otherwise, `l` is `max(1, ya - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))` and `r` is `min(w, ya + (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input. If `xa > xb`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, then `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`. Otherwise, `l` is `max(1, ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
