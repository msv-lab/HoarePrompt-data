The code snippet assigns the value of `max(1, ya - x)` to the variable `l`. Here, `x` is already defined as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. The value of `l` will be the maximum of 1 and the result of `ya - x`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - (abs(xa - xb) // 2))`**.
