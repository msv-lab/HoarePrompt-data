The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value of the input `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, then no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is set to the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `yb` minus `x`; otherwise, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `ya` minus `x`. In both cases, `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `yb` plus `x`.**
