The value of `l` is determined by the maximum of 1 and the expression `ya - x`. Since `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, the value of `l` will be the greater of 1 or `ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2)`**.
