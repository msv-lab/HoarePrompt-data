Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is (abs(`xa` - `xb`) // 2). If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is max(1, `yb` - `x`); otherwise, `l` is max(1, `ya` - `x`). If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `r` is min(`w`, `yb` + `x`); otherwise, `r` is min(`w`, `yb` + `x`).** 

To simplify, the postcondition can be summarized as follows:
Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is (abs(`xa` - `xb`) // 2). If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is max(1, `yb` - `x`); otherwise, `l` is max(1, `ya` - `x`). In both cases, `r` is min(`w`, `yb` + `x`).**
