Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`**

In natural language: The value of `l` is determined to be the maximum of 1 and the difference between `yb` and `x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
