Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the program reads six integers `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw". Otherwise, it calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true (odd), it sets `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. If `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw". If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is false (even), it sets `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. If `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".**

In simpler terms, the loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it determines whether player Alice or Bob wins based on their positions on a grid, or if the game is a draw. The specific conditions for winning depend on the parity of the distance between the players' starting positions along one axis and their relative positions along the other axis. After processing all `t` test cases, the loop ends.
