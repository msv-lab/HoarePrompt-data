The given code snippet increments the count of a specific key `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary by 1. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`.
- `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element.
- `freq` is a dictionary where the count of the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` is incremented by 1.
- `mod_x` remains `y % x`.
- `mod_y` remains `x % y`.
- `required_mod_x` remains `(x - (y % x)) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` remains `x % y`.

The only change is in the `freq` dictionary where the count for the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `y % x`, `mod_y` is `x % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (y % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `x % y`.**
