To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases but is not directly used in the print statement.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case. This is not used in the print statement.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`. This variable holds the current test case being processed.
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, representing the size of the array `a`.
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, representing a parameter.
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, representing another parameter.
- `a` is `case['array']`, representing the array of integers for the current test case.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary, not used in the print statement.
- `beautiful_count` is 0, also not used in the print statement.

Given this information, the print statement will output the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` from the current test case `case`.

Let's denote the current test case `case` as `(n, x, y, a)`. The print statement will format these values into a string.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n], [x], [y], and [a] are the respective values from the current test case in test_cases)**

Since the specific values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` depend on the current test case, we cannot provide exact numerical values without knowing the specific test case. However, we can describe the output format precisely.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where [n], [x], [y], and [a] are the respective values from the current test case in test_cases)**
