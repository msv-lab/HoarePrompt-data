Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1 for each occurrence in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found in `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. All other variables retain their previous values.
