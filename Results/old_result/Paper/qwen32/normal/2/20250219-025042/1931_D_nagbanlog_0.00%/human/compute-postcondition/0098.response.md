The given code calculates `required_mod_x` based on the current values of `x` and `mod_x`. Here's the updated state after executing the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `required_mod_x` has been calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. All other variables retain their previous values.
