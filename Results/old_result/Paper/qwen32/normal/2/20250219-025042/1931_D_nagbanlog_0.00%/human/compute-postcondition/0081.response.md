The given line of code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`. This means that the value of `beautiful_count` is updated based on the frequency of the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

Here's the breakdown of the variables:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is a list containing at least one test case.
- `results` remains unchanged as it contains the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case.
- `case` remains unchanged as it is the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are derived from `case`.
- `freq` remains unchanged except for the fact that its value is used to update `beautiful_count`.
- `mod_x` remains unchanged as it is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` remains unchanged as it is `num % y`.
- `num` remains unchanged as it is the next element of `a` if it exists.
- `required_mod_x` remains unchanged as it is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` remains unchanged as it is `mod_y`.
- `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the next element of `a` if it exists, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.**
