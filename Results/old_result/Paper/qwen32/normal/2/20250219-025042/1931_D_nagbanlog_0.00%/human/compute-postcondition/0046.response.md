The code snippet assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the dictionary `case` under the key `'params'`. The variable `case` is assumed to be a dictionary with a key `'params'` that contains a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`. However, the code only unpacks `n`, `x`, and `y` from this tuple, leaving `a` unused.

Given the initial state, the variable `case` holds the next test case, which is a dictionary with a key `'params'` containing a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`. After executing the code, `n`, `x`, and `y` will take the respective values from this tuple, while `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`.**
