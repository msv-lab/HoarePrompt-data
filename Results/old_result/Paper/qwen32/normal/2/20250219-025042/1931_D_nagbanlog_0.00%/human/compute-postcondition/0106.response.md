Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `n % y`. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` mapped to `0` and `beautiful_count` remains 0. If the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is already in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is set to `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]`.**
