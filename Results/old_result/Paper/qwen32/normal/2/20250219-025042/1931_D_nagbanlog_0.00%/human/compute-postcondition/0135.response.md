Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to determine the number of "beautiful" pairs and returns a list `results` containing the count of such pairs for each test case.**
