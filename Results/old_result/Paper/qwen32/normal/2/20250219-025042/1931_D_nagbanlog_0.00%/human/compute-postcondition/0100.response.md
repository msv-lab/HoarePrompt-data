To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case.
- `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `mod_x` is `n % x`.
- `mod_y` is `n % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `n % y`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

However, there is a variable `num` in the print statement that was not mentioned in the initial state. Given the context, it seems likely that `num` should be `n`, but since it's not explicitly stated, we'll assume `num` is intended to be `n` for this explanation.

Let's break down the values:
- `num` (assumed to be `n`): This is the first parameter of the current test case (`case['params'][0]`).
- `mod_x`: This is the remainder when `n` is divided by `x` (`n % x`).
- `mod_y`: This is the remainder when `n` is divided by `y` (`n % y`).
- `required_mod_x`: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which essentially gives the additional amount needed to make `n` a multiple of `x`.
- `required_mod_y`: This is the same as `mod_y` (`n % y`).

Given these definitions, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **Number: [n], mod_x: [n % x], mod_y: [n % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (n % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [n % y] (where n is the first parameter of the current test case, x is the second parameter, and y is the third parameter)**

If we assume `num` is indeed `n`, then the final output would be:
Output: **Number: [n], mod_x: [n % x], mod_y: [n % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (n % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [n % y]**
