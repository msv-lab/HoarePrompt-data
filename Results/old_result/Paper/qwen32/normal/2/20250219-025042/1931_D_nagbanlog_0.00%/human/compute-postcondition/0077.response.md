Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `mod_y` is being updated to the modulus of `num` divided by `y`. This means `mod_y` will now hold the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the next element of `a` if it exists, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

In natural language: The variable `mod_y` has been updated to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
