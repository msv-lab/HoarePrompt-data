In the given task, the for loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is not explicitly defined in the state before the loop starts. To ensure the loop executes, we need to define `test_cases` such that it contains at least one test case. Each test case should consist of the integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `a` as described.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`test_cases`**: This variable needs to be defined as a list containing at least one test case. Each test case should be a tuple or a list itself containing the integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `a`.

2. **`case`**: This variable will represent each individual test case within the loop. It does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it gets assigned a value from `test_cases` during each iteration.

Given these points, here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list**

This ensures that the loop can execute by providing at least one valid test case for the loop to iterate over.
