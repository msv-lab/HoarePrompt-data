The only object in the loop head is the variable `case`, which iterates over `test_cases`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state related to `case` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case
- `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element
- `freq` is a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1 for each occurrence in `a`
- `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found in `a`

For the loop to execute one more time, `case` should be updated to the next test case in `test_cases`.

Since the loop iterates over `test_cases`, the next iteration would involve moving to the subsequent test case in the list. Therefore, `case` needs to be updated to the next item in `test_cases`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases` (which means it should be the next item in the `test_cases` list), `n` is the first element of the new `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of the new `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of the new `case['params']`, `a` is the new `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary that will be recalculated based on the new `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found in the new `a`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head (`case`), the most accurate adjustment is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`**.
