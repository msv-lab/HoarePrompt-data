Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is updated by adding `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to it.**

Natural Language: The value of `beautiful_count` is updated by adding the frequency of the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` from the `freq` dictionary to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
