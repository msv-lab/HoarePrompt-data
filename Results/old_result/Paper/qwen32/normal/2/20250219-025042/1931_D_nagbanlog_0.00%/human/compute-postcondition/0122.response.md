The code calculates `required_mod_x` using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means that `required_mod_x` will be the value needed to add to `mod_x` to make it a multiple of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case
- `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`
- `n` is `case['params'][0]`
- `x` is `case['params'][1]`
- `y` is `case['params'][2]`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element
- `num` is the next element in `a`
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `num % y`

The new value of `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**.
