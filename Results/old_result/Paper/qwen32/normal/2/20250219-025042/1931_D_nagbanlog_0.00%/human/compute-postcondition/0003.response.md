The code snippet assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. This means that `a` now holds the list of integers specified in the current test case. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`.**
