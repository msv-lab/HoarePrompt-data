Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with counts of all `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs seen in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total number of "beautiful" pairs found based on the criteria in the loop, and the loop has finished processing all elements in `a`. A value has been returned and appended to `results`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After executing the code, the `results` list now contains the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
