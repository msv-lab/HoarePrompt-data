Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the new integer provided by user input; `a` is a new list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1; if `a[i-1] > a[i]`, then at the current index `i`, `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i-1] > a[i]`, `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting at index `i` to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`; `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`. If `a[i-1] <= a[i]`, `check_all` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise False, `new_all` is True if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True or False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
