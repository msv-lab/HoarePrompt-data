Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, the function returns some result based on the values in the list `a`.**
