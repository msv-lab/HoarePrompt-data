Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `check_all` is set to `False` and `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`. If `new_all` is `True`, the program continues as specified in the if part; otherwise, `new_all` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then `check_all` remains unchanged.**
