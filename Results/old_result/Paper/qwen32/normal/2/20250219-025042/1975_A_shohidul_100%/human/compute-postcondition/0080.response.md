Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`.**
