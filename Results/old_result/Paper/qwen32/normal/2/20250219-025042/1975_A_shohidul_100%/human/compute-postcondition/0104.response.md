The code snippet calculates whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and assigns the result to the variable `new_all`. 

Given the initial state, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`. The list comprehension checks each pair of consecutive elements in `new` to see if they are in non-decreasing order.

After executing the code, `new_all` will be `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` will be `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting at index `i` to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`; `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**
