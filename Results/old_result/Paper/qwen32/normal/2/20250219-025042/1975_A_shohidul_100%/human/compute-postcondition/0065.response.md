The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n`: An integer greater than 1.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^6.
- `i`: Calculated as `i_prev + 1`.
- `new`: A sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end.
- `check_all_new`: A boolean indicating if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.
- `new_all`: A boolean indicating if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

However, none of these variables affect the `print('YES')` statement. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
