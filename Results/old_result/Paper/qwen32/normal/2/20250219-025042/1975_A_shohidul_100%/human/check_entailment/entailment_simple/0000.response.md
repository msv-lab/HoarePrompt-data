### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The goal is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and the two parts are swapped.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the code:

1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES" because no operations are needed.

2. **Finding the First Decrease**: If the array is not initially sorted, the code looks for the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This identifies the point where the array stops being non-decreasing.

3. **Checking the Suffix**: Once the first decrease is found at index `i`, the code checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix starting from index `i`.
   - `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are satisfied, it means that the array can be split into a prefix and a suffix such that swapping them results in a sorted array, so it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The code only checks the first occurrence of a decrease and assumes that if the suffix is sorted and the first element of the array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix, the entire array can be sorted by a single swap. This assumption is incorrect because the prefix might still contain elements that are out of order relative to the suffix.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. The first decrease is at index 1 (`3 > 1`). The suffix `[1, 4, 1, 5]` is not sorted, so the code would incorrectly print "NO". However, by splitting the array into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, and then swapping, we get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`, which is not sorted. Further operations are required to sort the array, but the code does not account for this.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle all cases and may incorrectly print "NO" for arrays that can be sorted with multiple swaps.

**Correctness: False**
