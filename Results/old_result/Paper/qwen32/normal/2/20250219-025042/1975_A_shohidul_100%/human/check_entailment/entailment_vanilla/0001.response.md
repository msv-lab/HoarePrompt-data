Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we are given an array `a` of `n` positive integers.
- We need to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting it into two parts (prefix and suffix) and swapping them.
- The program should output "Yes" if it's possible to sort the array using the described operation, otherwise "No".

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking if Already Sorted:**
   - The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints "YES" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Checking for Possible Sorting:**
   - If the array is not initially sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
   - Once such a position is found, it creates a new subarray `new` starting from index `i` to the end of the array.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray `new`.
     - `new_all`: Ensures that the new subarray `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Checking Possible Sorting:**
  - The logic used to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and suffix is flawed.
  - The program only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the new subarray and if the new subarray is sorted. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted by any number of swaps.
  - For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. The program would incorrectly identify the first unsorted pair at `i=1` and check if `[3] >= [1, 4, 1, 5]` and if `[1, 4, 1, 5]` is sorted, which is not the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
