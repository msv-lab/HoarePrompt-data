To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it progresses with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
2. **Condition Inside Loop**: For each `i`, it checks if `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - If `a[i-1] > a[i]`, it creates a sublist `new = a[i:]` and checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
     - `new_all`: Whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

### Key Points:
- The loop will terminate as soon as it finds the first pair `(a[i-1], a[i])` where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and evaluates the conditions.
- If no such pair is found, the loop will complete all iterations without printing anything.

### Given Output States:
- After 1st iteration: The loop checked `a[0] > a[1]` and evaluated the conditions.
- After 2nd iteration: The loop checked `a[1] > a[2]` and evaluated the conditions.
- After 3rd iteration: The loop checked `a[2] > a[3]` and evaluated the conditions.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without finding any pair `(a[i-1], a[i])` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, it means the list `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Since `check_all` is initially `False` and the loop doesn't find any pair to change this, it implies the list was not sorted initially but has been verified to be sorted after all iterations.

Thus, the final output state is that the loop completes all iterations without printing 'YES' or 'NO', indicating that the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **The loop completes all iterations without printing 'YES' or 'NO', indicating that the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
