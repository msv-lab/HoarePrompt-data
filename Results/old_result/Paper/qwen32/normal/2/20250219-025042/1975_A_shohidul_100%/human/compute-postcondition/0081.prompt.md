Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the new integer provided by user input; `a` is the list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order after the check, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `check_all` is set to `False` and `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`. If `new_all` is `True`, the program continues as specified in the if part; otherwise, `new_all` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then `check_all` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is `a[i:]`, `check_all_new` indicates whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, `new_all` indicates whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited regardless of the condition `check_all_new and new_all`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
