Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is the new integer provided by user input.
- `a` is a new list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
- `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'YES'`. It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, or `_`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
