The code snippet `s = input()` changes the value of the variable `s` to whatever string is provided as input. The initial state specifies that `s` was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, but this value is overwritten by the new input. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0.**
