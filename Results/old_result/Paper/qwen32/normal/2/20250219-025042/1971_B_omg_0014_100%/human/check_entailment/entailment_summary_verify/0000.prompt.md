You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed from `s` if `s` is not already sorted; otherwise, it prints the lexicographically largest string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Rearrange the characters of `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, or report that it's impossible.
- Input consists of multiple test cases.
- For each test case, output "YES" followed by the rearranged string `r` if possible; otherwise, output "NO".

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each string `s` as follows:
1. It creates a set `a` from the string `s` to determine the unique characters.
2. If the length of the set `a` is 1 (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), it outputs "NO".
3. Otherwise, it outputs "YES" and attempts to generate a different string `r` by sorting the string in ascending order (`b`) and descending order (`c`).
4. If the sorted string `b` is the same as the original string `s`, it outputs the reversed sorted string `c`; otherwise, it outputs `b`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same by outputting "NO".
- For strings with more than one unique character, the program attempts to generate a different string by sorting. However, this approach may not always produce a valid result because sorting in ascending or descending order might still yield the same string if the original string is already sorted or has a specific pattern.

### Edge Case Consideration:
Consider the string "abc". Sorting it in ascending order yields "abc", which is the same as the original string. The program would then sort it in descending order, yielding "cba", which is different from the original string. This works correctly.

However, consider the string "acbac". Sorting it in ascending order yields "aacbc", which is different from the original string. The program would output "YES" and "aacbc", which is correct.

Now, consider the string "abacaba". Sorting it in ascending order yields "aaabaca", which is different from the original string. The program would output "YES" and "aaabaca", which is correct.

But let's consider the string "aabbaa". Sorting it in ascending order yields "aabbaa", which is the same as the original string. The program would then sort it in descending order, yielding "bbaaaa", which is different from the original string. This works correctly.

However, consider the string "aaaabbb". Sorting it in ascending order yields "aaaabbb", which is the same as the original string. The program would then sort it in descending order, yielding "bbbbaaa", which is different from the original string. This works correctly.

After careful consideration, it seems that the program correctly handles all edge cases by ensuring that the generated string `r` is different from the original string `s` when possible.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies when it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string (when all characters are the same) and successfully generates a different string when possible by sorting in ascending or descending order.
