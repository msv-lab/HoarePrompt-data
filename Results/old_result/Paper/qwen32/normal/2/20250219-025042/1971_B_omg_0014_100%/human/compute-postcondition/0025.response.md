Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then no additional changes are made. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the new `s` sorted in descending order. `c` is now the string `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` equals `s`, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is sorted in descending order and stored in `c`.**
