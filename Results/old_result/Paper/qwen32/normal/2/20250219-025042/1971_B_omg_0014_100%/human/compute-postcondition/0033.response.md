The code snippet sorts the string `s` in descending order and assigns the result to `c`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from the new `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is the sorted version of `s` in descending order.**
