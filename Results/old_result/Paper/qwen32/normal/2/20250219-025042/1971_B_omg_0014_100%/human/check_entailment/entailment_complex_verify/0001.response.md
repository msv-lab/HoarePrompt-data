### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to rearrange the characters of a string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
- If it's impossible to do so, output "NO".
- Otherwise, output "YES" followed by one possible rearrangement of the string.

#### Program Code Recap
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

#### Annotations Recap
- The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads a string `s`.
- It checks if all characters in the string are the same by creating a set `a` from the characters of `s`.
- If the length of the set `a` is 1, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES" and then prints the lexicographically smallest string `b` that can be formed from `s` if `s` is not already sorted; otherwise, it prints the lexicographically largest string `c`.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations

1. **Handling Strings with All Identical Characters:**
   - When `len(a) == 1`, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to rearrange a string with all identical characters to form a different string.

2. **Handling Strings with Different Characters:**
   - When `len(a) > 1`, the program outputs "YES".
   - It then generates two possible rearrangements:
     - `b`: The lexicographically smallest string formed by sorting `s`.
     - `c`: The lexicographically largest string formed by sorting `s` in reverse.
   - If `b` (sorted string) is equal to `s`, it prints `c` (reverse-sorted string).
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b`.

3. **Ensuring Output is Different from Input:**
   - By printing `c` when `b == s`, the program ensures that the output string `r` is different from `s`.
   - By printing `b` when `b != s`, the program ensures that the output string `r` is different from `s`.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach correctly handles both scenarios:
     - Strings with all identical characters.
     - Strings with different characters.
   - The program guarantees that the output string `r` is different from `s` whenever possible.

#### Conclusion

Based on the systematic evaluation and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles both possible scenarios appropriately and ensures that the output string `r` is different from `s` whenever possible.
