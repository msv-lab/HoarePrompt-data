Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a set of unique characters from `s`.
- The length of `a` is greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet directly outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the initial state variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`). Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
