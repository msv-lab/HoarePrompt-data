The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `edges`. This action does not affect the values of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, or `t`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the creation of the `edges` list.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list.**
