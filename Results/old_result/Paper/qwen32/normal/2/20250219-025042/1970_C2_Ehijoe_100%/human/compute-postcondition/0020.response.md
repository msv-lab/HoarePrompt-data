The code appends `key` to the `leaves` deque. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `leaves`. The `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is a deque containing `key`.**
