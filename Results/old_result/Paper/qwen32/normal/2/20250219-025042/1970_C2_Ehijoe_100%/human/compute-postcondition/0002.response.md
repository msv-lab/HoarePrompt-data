Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is set to `True`. All other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`) remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.
