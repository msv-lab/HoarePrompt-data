The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` reassigns the `nodes` variable to a new `defaultdict` object where the default factory is `list`. This means that when a key is accessed that does not exist, it will automatically create a new list for that key.

Given the initial state, the `nodes` variable was a dictionary, and now it is specifically a `defaultdict` of lists. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
