Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= `start` <= n, `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. `key` is the next key in `nodes` after `prev_key`. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `leaves` is a deque containing `key` at the end. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.**
