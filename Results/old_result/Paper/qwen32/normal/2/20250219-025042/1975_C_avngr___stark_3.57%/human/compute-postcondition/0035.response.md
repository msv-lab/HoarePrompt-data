The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` is now updated to hold the new list of integers from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `max`) remain unchanged by this code snippet. Specifically:
- `t` is still incremented by `n-2`.
- `n` remains the same as it was an input integer.
- `max` is still the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive elements in the original `a`.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive elements in the original `a`.**
