The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `max`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is unchanged, and `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive elements in `a`.**
