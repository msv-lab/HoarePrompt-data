Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`.
- `y` is an integer read from the input such that \(0 \leq y \leq 99\).
- Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else the ceiling of `x / 15`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - For example, if `y = 5`, then `y / 2 = 2.5` and `bxsfory = ceil(2.5) = 3`.

2. **Determine `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else the ceiling of `x / 15`.
   - First, we need to determine the value of `x` after it is updated.
   - The update formula for `x` is `x = x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`.

3. **Update `x`:**
   - Let's assume `x` initially is some positive value, say `x_initial`.
   - After updating, `x` becomes `x_initial - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`.
   - If the resulting `x` is greater than 0, then `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of `x / 15`.
   - If the resulting `x` is less than or equal to 0, then `bxsfory1` is 0.

4. **Calculate `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`:**
   - We need to consider two cases:
     - Case 1: `x > 0` after the update.
       - `bxsfory1 = ceil(x / 15)`
       - `bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)`
       - The result is `ceil(x / 15) + ceil(y / 2)`.
     - Case 2: `x <= 0` after the update.
       - `bxsfory1 = 0`
       - `bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)`
       - The result is `0 + ceil(y / 2) = ceil(y / 2)`.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the formula, the output depends on the value of `x` after the update. However, since we don't have the initial value of `x` or `y`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **`bxsfory1 + bxsfory` (where `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else the ceiling of `x / 15`, and `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`)**
