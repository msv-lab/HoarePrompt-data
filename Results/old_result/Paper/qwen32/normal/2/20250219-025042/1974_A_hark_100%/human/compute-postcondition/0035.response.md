Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the integer read from the input, `k` is incremented by 1, `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `bxsfory1` is determined based on the current value of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is set to 0. Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
