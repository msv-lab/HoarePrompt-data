To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `k` is incremented by 1 (though `k` is not used in the provided print statement).

### Key Variables:
- `x`: This is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `math.ceil()`: This function rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

### Calculation:
The expression inside the `print` statement is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. To determine the output, we need to consider the range of possible values for `x` and how they affect the result of `x / 15`.

#### Range of `x / 15`:
- If `x = 0`, then `x / 15 = 0`.
- If `x = 14`, then `x / 15 ≈ 0.9333`, and `math.ceil(0.9333) = 1`.
- If `x = 15`, then `x / 15 = 1.0`, and `math.ceil(1.0) = 1`.
- If `x = 29`, then `x / 15 ≈ 1.9333`, and `math.ceil(1.9333) = 2`.
- If `x = 30`, then `x / 15 = 2.0`, and `math.ceil(2.0) = 2`.
- ...
- If `x = 99`, then `x / 15 ≈ 6.6`, and `math.ceil(6.6) = 7`.

### Conclusion:
The output of `math.ceil(x / 15)` will depend on the specific value of `x`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `x`:

- When `x` is between 0 and 14, the output is 1.
- When `x` is between 15 and 29, the output is 2.
- When `x` is between 30 and 44, the output is 3.
- When `x` is between 45 and 59, the output is 4.
- When `x` is between 60 and 74, the output is 5.
- When `x` is between 75 and 89, the output is 6.
- When `x` is between 90 and 99, the output is 7.

Given the range of `x`, the output will be an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is an integer between 0 and 99)**
