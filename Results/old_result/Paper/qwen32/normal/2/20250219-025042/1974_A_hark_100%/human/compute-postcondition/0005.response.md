The value of `x` is updated according to the expression `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. Here, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`. The values of `t`, `ap`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the new value of `x`:
- `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- The new value of `x` is `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` is the same integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99, and both `x` and `y` are greater than 0; `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**
