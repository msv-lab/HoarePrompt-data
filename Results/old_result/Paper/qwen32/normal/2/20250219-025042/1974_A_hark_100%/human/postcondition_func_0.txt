The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions involving `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are greater than zero, it computes a combined result considering both values. If only `y` is greater than zero, it computes a result based solely on `y`. If only `x` is greater than zero, it computes a result based solely on `x`. If both `x` and `y` are zero, it prints `0`.
