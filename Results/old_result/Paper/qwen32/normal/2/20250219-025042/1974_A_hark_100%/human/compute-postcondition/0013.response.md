Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `y` is equal to 0.

We need to determine what the following Python code will print:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `x`**: Since `x` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, it can take any value from 1 to 99.
2. **Value of `y`**: `y` is explicitly stated to be 0, but this does not affect the calculation in the `print` statement.
3. **Expression `x / 15`**: This expression divides `x` by 15. Since `x` ranges from 1 to 99, `x / 15` will range from approximately 0.0667 to 6.6.
4. **Applying `math.ceil`**: The `math.ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer. Therefore, `math.ceil(x / 15)` will round up the result of `x / 15` to the nearest whole number.

### Calculation of Possible Outputs:
- If `x` is 1 to 14, `x / 15` is between 0.0667 and 0.9333, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is 1.
- If `x` is 15 to 29, `x / 15` is between 1 and 1.9333, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is 2.
- If `x` is 30 to 44, `x / 15` is between 2 and 2.9333, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is 3.
- If `x` is 45 to 59, `x / 15` is between 3 and 3.9333, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is 4.
- If `x` is 60 to 74, `x / 15` is between 4 and 4.9333, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is 5.
- If `x` is 75 to 89, `x / 15` is between 5 and 5.9333, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is 6.
- If `x` is 90 to 99, `x / 15` is between 6 and 6.6, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is 7.

### Conclusion:
The printed value depends on the specific value of `x`. However, since `x` can be any integer from 1 to 99, the output of `math.ceil(x / 15)` can be any integer from 1 to 7.

Therefore, the output will be one of the integers from 1 to 7, depending on the value of `x`.

Output: **an integer from 1 to 7 (where the integer is the result of math.ceil(x / 15) and x is an integer from 1 to 99)**
