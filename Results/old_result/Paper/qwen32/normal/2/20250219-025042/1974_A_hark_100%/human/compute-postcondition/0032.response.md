The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, `ap` is at least 1, and `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99. Additionally, `k` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code snippet, `x` and `y` will take on the new values provided by the input. The values of `t`, `ap`, and the incremented `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, and `k` is incremented by 1.**
