Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If either `x == 0` or `y == 0`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
