Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `ap`: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x`: An integer updated based on the formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - `y`: Two integers read from the input such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `k`: Incremented by 1 (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `bxsfory`: The ceiling of `y / 2`, i.e., `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - `bxsfory1`: 
     - If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is 0.
     - Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`. For example, if `y` is 7, then `bxsfory` would be `math.ceil(7 / 2) = math.ceil(3.5) = 4`.

2. **Determine `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` depends on the value of `x` after it is updated.
   - If `x` is updated to a value less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` becomes 0.
   - If `x` is updated to a positive value, `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of `x / 15`. For example, if `x` is 30, then `bxsfory1` would be `math.ceil(30 / 15) = math.ceil(2.0) = 2`.

3. **Summing `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`:**
   - The print statement outputs the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
   - This sum will vary depending on the specific values of `x` and `y` after the update to `x`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the initial state and the transformations applied to `x`, the final output will be the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 is 0 if x <= 0, otherwise math.ceil(x / 15), and bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2))**
