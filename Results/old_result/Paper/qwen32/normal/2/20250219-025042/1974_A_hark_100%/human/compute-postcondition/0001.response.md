In this case, the loop is controlled by the variable `ap`, which determines the number of iterations. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` are mentioned as part of the problem context but are not directly involved in the loop's control mechanism.

To ensure that the loop can execute, `ap` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variables `k`, `t`, `x`, and `y` are not adjustable in the context of making the loop execute, as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variable `k` and the range `ap`.
2. For the loop to execute, `ap` must be at least 1.
3. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they don't need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure `ap` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `ap` must be greater than or equal to 1**
