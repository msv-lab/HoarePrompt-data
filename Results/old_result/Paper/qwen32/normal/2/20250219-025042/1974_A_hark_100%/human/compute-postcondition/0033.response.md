The code calculates the ceiling of `y / 2` and assigns it to the variable `bxsfory`. This means `bxsfory` will hold the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged except for the new variable `bxsfory` which is introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `k` is incremented by 1, `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.**
