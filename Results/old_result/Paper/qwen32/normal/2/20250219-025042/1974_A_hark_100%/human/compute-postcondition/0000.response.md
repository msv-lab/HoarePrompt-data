Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `ap` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `ap` is assigned the value of an integer input, while the initial conditions for `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
