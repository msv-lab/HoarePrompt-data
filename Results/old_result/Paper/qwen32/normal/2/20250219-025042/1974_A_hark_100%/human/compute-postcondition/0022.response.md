Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `k` is incremented by 1, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` has been updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. All other variables (`t`, `ap`, `y`, `k`, and `bxsfory`) retain their initial values or states.
