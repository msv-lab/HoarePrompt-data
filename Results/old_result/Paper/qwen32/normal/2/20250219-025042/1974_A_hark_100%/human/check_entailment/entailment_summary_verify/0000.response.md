### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its logic against the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Function Definition Issue:
The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which would indeed lead to a `NameError`. This is a critical issue that prevents the program from running at all.

#### Logic for Placing Icons:
The logic for calculating the number of screens required is flawed, as mentioned in the original assessment. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Handling 2x2 Icons (`y > 0`)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons using `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (which occupy 4 cells each).

2. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons (`x > 0`)**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program attempts to adjust the count of 1x1 icons with the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This line is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is nonsensical. It subtracts 15 times the number of screens used for 2x2 icons and adds 4 times the number of 2x2 icons, which doesn't make logical sense in the context of counting remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons and then determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - The program then calculates `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is intended to determine the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, due to the incorrect adjustment of `x`, this calculation is also flawed.

#### Edge Cases:
The program handles some edge cases correctly, such as when `x == 0` and `y > 0`, or when `x > 0` and `y == 0`. However, it fails to correctly calculate the number of screens required when both `x` and `y` are non-zero.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified:
1. The function definition issue causes a runtime error.
2. The logic for calculating the number of screens is flawed, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
