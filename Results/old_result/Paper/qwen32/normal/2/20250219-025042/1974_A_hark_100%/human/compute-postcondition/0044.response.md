Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes `t` test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` (with constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, the function performs some operation (not specified in the given details) and returns a result for each test case.**
