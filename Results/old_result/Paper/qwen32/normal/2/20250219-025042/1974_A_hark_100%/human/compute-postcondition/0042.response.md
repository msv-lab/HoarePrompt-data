Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0 and y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`. If `x <= 0 or y <= 0`, then `x` and `y` remain the same integers read from the input.**
