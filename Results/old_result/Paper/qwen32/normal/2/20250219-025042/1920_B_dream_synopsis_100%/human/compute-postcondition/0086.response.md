The given code snippet reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. This means the previous list with `k + 1` elements is discarded, and `ans` now holds an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list.**
