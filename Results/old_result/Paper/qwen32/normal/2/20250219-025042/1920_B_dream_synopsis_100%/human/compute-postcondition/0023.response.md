Given the code snippet and the initial state, the variable `sums` in the list `ans` is being updated. Specifically, the code modifies `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `sums` was initially calculated based on the condition of `i`.
- The code updates `sums` using the formula `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1.

Let's incorporate these changes into the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`, which is now updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been adjusted according to the specified formula, and `i` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
