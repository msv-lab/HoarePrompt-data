The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop `for i in range(k + 1):`, we know that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a specific value. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we simply increment `i` by 1.

Let's break down the state adjustments:

- If `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, it will be 1 in the next iteration.
- If `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, it will be 2 in the next iteration.
- This pattern continues until `i` reaches `k`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `i_prev`. The state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` set to `i_prev + 1`.

However, since we are asked to provide a general state, we can assume that the previous iteration had `i` set to some value `i`, and the next iteration will have `i` set to `i + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

To be more precise, if the previous state had `i` as some value, say `i_prev`, then the new state will have `i` as `i_prev + 1`.

For a concrete example, if `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`. `i` is 1.**

Generalizing this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
