The code calculates `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. Since `a` is a reversed sorted list, `a[:x]` contains the `x` largest elements of `a`.

Given:
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of the `x` largest elements in `a`.

Therefore, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
