To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given:
- The loop is `for i in range(k + 1):`, meaning `i` ranges from 0 to `k`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the state adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

2. **Other Variables:** The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `sums`) are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Given that we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

However, since we are asked to provide a specific state, let's assume `i_prev` was the last value before the current iteration, which means if the loop just finished iterating with `i = k`, the next iteration would start with `i = k + 1`, but since the range is `k + 1`, the loop would terminate. Therefore, we need to consider the state just before the loop terminates.

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate, so the state just before the termination would be when `i` is `k`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is the same as the state just before the loop terminates) would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is `k`**.

But since we need to show the state at the start of the next iteration before the loop terminates, we consider `i` to be incremented by 1 from its previous value, which would be `i = k + 1` if the loop were to continue, but since it doesn't, we show the state just before it would terminate:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is `k`**

However, if we strictly follow the instruction to show the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be `i = k + 1` if the loop continued), we get:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is `k + 1`**

Since the loop terminates at `i = k + 1`, the state just before termination is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is `k`**

But to strictly adhere to showing the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be `i = k + 1` if the loop continued):

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is `k + 1`**

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is `k + 1`**
