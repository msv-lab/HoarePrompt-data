The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` adds the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` to the variable `sums`. Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, the value of `a[i - 1]` is known based on the value of `i`.

Since `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, we know that `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `a`. The value of `sums` will be updated to its current value plus the value of `a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `x` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
