Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sums` and the second also being `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ans` now contains two elements. The first element is `sums`, and the second element is the updated value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
