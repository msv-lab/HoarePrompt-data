The code modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0; the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
