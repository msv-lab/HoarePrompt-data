The given code snippet modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression used to modify `sums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is not equal to 0
- `i + x - 1` is less than `n`

After executing the line `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, the new value of `sums` is calculated as described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
