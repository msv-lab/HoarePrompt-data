The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that `a` is no longer a reversed sorted list of integers as initially stated, but rather a new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` computed after each iteration of the loop.**
