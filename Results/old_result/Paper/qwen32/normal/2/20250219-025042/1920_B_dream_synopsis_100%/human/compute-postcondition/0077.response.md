Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[-1] - 2 * a[x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[-1]`. `i` remains 0.**
