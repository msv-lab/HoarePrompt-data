The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sums` and the second also being `sums`; `i` is incremented by 1; `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
