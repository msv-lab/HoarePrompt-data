Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements, where the first two elements are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and the third element is `sums`; `i` is 0; `sums` is `sums + a[-1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `ans` now contains three elements. The first two elements remain unchanged as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The third element is the value of `sums`. All other variables retain their initial values.
