Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `x` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
