The code snippet reverses the list `a`. Given that `a` was initially a sorted list of integers, after reversing, `a` will be in descending order instead of ascending order. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.**
