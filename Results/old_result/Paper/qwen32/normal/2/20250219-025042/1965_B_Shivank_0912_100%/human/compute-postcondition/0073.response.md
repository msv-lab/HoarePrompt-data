To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

### Initial State Analysis:
- We have a list that includes the following elements:
  - \( k - (1 << i) \)
  - \( k + 1 \)
  - \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \)
  - The numbers 1 through 65536, doubling each time (powers of 2 up to \(2^{16}\)).
- The list excludes \(2^i\).

### Understanding the List Elements:
- \(1 << i\) is equivalent to \(2^i\).
- Therefore, the list explicitly contains:
  - \( k - 2^i \)
  - \( k + 1 \)
  - \( k + 1 + 2^i \)
  - Powers of 2 from 1 to 65536, excluding \(2^i\).

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.
- Since `ans` is the list described above, the output will be these elements in order.

### Final Output Description:
Given the structure of the list, the output will be:
- \( k - 2^i \)
- \( k + 1 \)
- \( k + 1 + 2^i \)
- Followed by the powers of 2 from 1 to 65536, excluding \(2^i\).

### Formatting the Output:
We need to express this in the required format:
Output: **k - 2^i, k + 1, k + 1 + 2^i, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536 (excluding 2^i)**

This ensures that the output precisely reflects the elements of the list `ans` as described in the initial state.

Output: **k - 2^i, k + 1, k + 1 + 2^i, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536 (excluding 2^i)**
