You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    6 1
    
    8 8

    10 7

Output

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)

    #State: A series of concatenated lists, each containing 21 numbers: [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] excluding \(2^i\) for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a list of 21 integers based on the value of `k`. The list includes specific powers of 2 and values derived from `k`, ensuring that one particular power of 2 (determined by the highest power less than or equal to `k`) is excluded.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
  1. There is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
  2. For every integer `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`:**
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k:` increments `i` until `2^(i+1)` exceeds `k`. This means `2^i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that we can form sums up to `k-1` but not `k` itself.
     - `k + 1`: This value is greater than `k`, ensuring no subsequence involving this element will sum to `k`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: Another value greater than `k` for additional flexibility.
   - The loop `for j in range(20):` appends powers of 2 (`1 << j`) to `ans`, except when `j == i`. This is to ensure that we can form all sums up to `n` except `k`.

### Verification Against Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
   - By construction, the sequence avoids having any combination of elements that sum exactly to `k`. Specifically, `k - (1 << i)` ensures that the highest sum we can get close to `k` is `k-1`.

2. **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are Possible:**
   - The inclusion of various powers of 2 allows us to form any sum through combinations, except for `k` due to the specific exclusion of `1 << i` in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program constructs a sequence that meets the requirements of the problem statement. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) to be formed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
