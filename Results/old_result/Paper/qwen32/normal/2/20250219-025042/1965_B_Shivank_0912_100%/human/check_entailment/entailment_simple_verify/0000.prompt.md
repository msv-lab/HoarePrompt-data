You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- The sequence should not allow any subsequence to sum to `k`.
- For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program generates a sequence based on powers of 2 and specific adjustments around `k`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. **Determine `i`**: It finds the largest `i` such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).
4. **Construct Sequence**:
   - It starts with three elements: \(k - 2^i\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 1 + 2^i\).
   - It then appends all powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).

### Verification:
We need to check if this sequence satisfies the conditions for all possible values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

#### Checking the Conditions:
1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The sequence includes \(k - 2^i\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 1 + 2^i\). These elements alone cannot sum to `k` because the smallest element is \(k - 2^i\) and the others are larger.
   - The inclusion of other powers of 2 doesn't change this since no combination of these powers of 2 can sum to `k` due to the specific construction.

2. **Subsequences Sum to All Values from 1 to `n` (except `k`)**:
   - The inclusion of powers of 2 allows for the generation of many sums. Since the sequence includes \(2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{19}\) (except \(2^i\)), it can generate sums up to \(2^{20} - 1\), which is much larger than the maximum possible `n` (which is \(10^6\)).
   - The specific adjustments around `k` ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`, but other sums are covered by the powers of 2.

### Edge Cases:
- **Small Values of `n` and `k`**: The program handles small values well, as seen in the examples.
- **Large Values of `n` and `k`**: The inclusion of powers of 2 ensures that the sequence can generate sums up to a very large number, covering all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it appears to satisfy the conditions for all potential cases within the given constraints. The construction of the sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing for all other sums from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program constructs a sequence using powers of 2 and specific adjustments around `k` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing for all other sums from 1 to `n`. This approach works for all valid inputs within the given constraints.
