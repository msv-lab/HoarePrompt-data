The code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of \(2^j\) to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 18, the value being appended is \(2^{18}\), which equals 262144.

The variables `n`, `k`, the list excluding \(2^i\), `tc`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `ans` now includes the new element 262144.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq k\), `j` is 18, `ans` includes the new element 262144.**
