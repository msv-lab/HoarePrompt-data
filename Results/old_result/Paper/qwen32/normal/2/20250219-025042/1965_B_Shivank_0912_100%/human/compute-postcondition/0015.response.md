The code appends the value of \(1 << j\) to the list `ans`. Given that `ans` was initially \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]\), after the append operation, `ans` will now include this new element.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer; `k` is unchanged; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]\); `j` is not equal to `i`.**
