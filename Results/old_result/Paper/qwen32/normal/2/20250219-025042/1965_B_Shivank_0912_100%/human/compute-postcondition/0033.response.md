To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Given the current state:
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `k` must be at least 4
- `i` is 2

Let's break down the condition `1 << i + 1 <= k`:

1. Calculate `1 << i + 1`:
   - Since `i` is 2, `1 << i` is `1 << 2`, which equals 4.
   - Adding 1 to this result gives `4 + 1 = 5`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `5 <= k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 5.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 5. The other variables (`tc`, `n`, and the list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`) do not need to be modified as they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072], `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` must be at least 5, `i` is 2]**
