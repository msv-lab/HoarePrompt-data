Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`.
- `tc` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `k` is the second integer from input.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\).
- `j` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
ans.append(1 << j)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`.
- Since `j` is 1, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 1`, which is `2`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be:
- If `j` equals `i`, `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending `2`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`.
- If `j` does not equal `i`, `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`. After appending `2`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`.

Since the problem does not specify whether `j` equals `i`, we consider both cases. However, since `j` is given as 1, we should consider the possibility that `j` might or might not equal `i`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\), and `j` is 1.**
