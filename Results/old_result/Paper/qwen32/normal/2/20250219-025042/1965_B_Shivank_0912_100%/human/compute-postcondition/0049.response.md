To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the initial state provided. Let's break down the given information:

### Initial State:
- We have a list that includes several elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.
- This list excludes \(2^i\).

### Variables:
- `k`: An integer.
- `i`: An integer.
- `1 << i`: This is equivalent to \(2^i\).

### Analysis:
1. **List Elements**:
   - The list contains several powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
   - It also includes three additional elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - The element \(2^i\) is excluded from this list.

2. **Variable `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `ans` holds the list described above.

### Output:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be the elements of the list `ans`, which includes all the specified elements except \(2^i\).

### Final Output:
Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072 excluding \(2^i\) (where \(k\) is an integer, \(i\) is an integer, and \(1 << i\) is \(2^i\))**
