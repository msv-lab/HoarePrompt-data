To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This condition checks if \(2^{(i+1)} \leq k\). Given the current state:
- `n` is an input integer (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `k` must be at least 2.
- The list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged.
- `tc` is 1.
- `i` is 1.

Let's evaluate the current condition:
- With `i` being 1, the condition becomes \(2^{(1+1)} \leq k\), which simplifies to \(2^2 \leq k\) or \(4 \leq k\).

Since `k` must be at least 2, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, since `i` is currently 1, we should also consider what happens in the next iteration. In the next iteration, `i` would increment to 2, and the condition would become \(2^{(2+1)} \leq k\) or \(8 \leq k\). Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only involves `k` and `i`.

Thus, the modified state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, the list `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged, `tc` is 1, `i` is 1**
