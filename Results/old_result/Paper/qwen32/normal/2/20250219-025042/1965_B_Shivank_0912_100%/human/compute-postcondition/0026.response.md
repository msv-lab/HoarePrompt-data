The only variable in the loop head is `tc` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that it was incremented by 1 during the loop body execution. Therefore, `tc` should now be one more than its value at the start of the last iteration. Since the initial value of `tc` is typically 0 (if not specified otherwise), and it gets incremented each iteration, we can assume that at the start of the current iteration, `tc` was `x`, and at the end of the last iteration, `tc` became `x + 1`.

Given the information provided, we need to adjust `tc` for the next iteration. If `tc` was `x` at the start of the last iteration, then at the end of the last iteration, `tc` became `x + 1`. For the next iteration, `tc` should be `x + 1`.

Since we don't have the explicit initial value of `tc`, let's assume that `tc` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, making it 1 at the end of the first iteration, 2 at the end of the second iteration, and so on. Therefore, if `tc` is 1 at the end of the first iteration, it should be 2 at the start of the second iteration.

Thus, if `tc` is `x + 1` at the end of the last iteration, for the next iteration, `tc` should be `x + 2`.

However, since the exact value of `tc` at the start of the last iteration is not provided, we can generalize that `tc` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the last iteration.

State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072], `tc` is incremented by 1** 

If we assume `tc` was 0 at the start and 1 at the end of the first iteration, then for the second iteration, `tc` should be 2, and so on. But without loss of generality, we can say:

State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072], `tc` is `tc + 1`**

But to provide a concrete example, if `tc` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, then for the next iteration:

State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072], `tc` is 2**
