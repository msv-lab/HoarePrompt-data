The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 2, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 2`, which is 4. Therefore, the list `ans` will now include this new element.

Output State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4]`, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\), and `j` is 2**.
