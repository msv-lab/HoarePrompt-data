The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 20. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\), and `j` is 2**
