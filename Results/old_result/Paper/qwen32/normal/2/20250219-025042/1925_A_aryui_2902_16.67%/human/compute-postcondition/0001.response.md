The given code snippet initializes a string `s` with the value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`. This string does not change during the execution of the provided code snippet. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state but are not modified by the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values remain as described in the initial state.

Since no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `k` in the provided code snippet, and `s` is initialized with a specific value, the output state remains consistent with the initial state except for the addition of the string `s`.

Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. The input is provided through standard input where the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26). `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the last test case read from the input. `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`.**
