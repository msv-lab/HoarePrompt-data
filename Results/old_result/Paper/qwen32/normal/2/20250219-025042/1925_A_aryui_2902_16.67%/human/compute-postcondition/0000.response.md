Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. The input is provided through standard input where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the last test case read from the input.**

Natural Language Explanation: The function `func_1` remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` are updated to hold the values of the last test case read from the input. The constraints on `t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same.
