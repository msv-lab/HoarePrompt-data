The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the input values are read as strings, `n` and `m` will now hold string representations of the numbers provided in the input.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `n` is now a string representing the first positive integer from the input.
- `m` is now a string representing the second positive integer from the input.
- `ans` is still `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, but since `n` and `m` have been reassigned, this expression needs to be recalculated using the new string values of `n` and `m`.
- `T` is `T + 1`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a string representing the first positive integer from the input, `m` is a string representing the second positive integer from the input, `ans` is `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` (recalculate using the new string values of `n` and `m`), `T` is `T + 1`.**
