The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. Given the initial state, `ans` was `n`, so now `ans` becomes `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`**.
