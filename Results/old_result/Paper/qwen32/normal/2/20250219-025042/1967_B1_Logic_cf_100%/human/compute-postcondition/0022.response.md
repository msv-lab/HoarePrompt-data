The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains the first positive integer from the input, at least 2.
- `m` remains the second positive integer from the input, at least 2.
- `b` remains `b_initial + 2`.
- `T` remains equal to `t`.

The new value of `ans` is calculated as follows:
- Original `ans` was `n + (n + b_initial) // (b_initial * b_initial) + (n + b_initial + 1) // ((b_initial + 1) * (b_initial + 1))`.
- New `ans` is original `ans` plus `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` is:
`ans = n + (n + b_initial) // (b_initial * b_initial) + (n + b_initial + 1) // ((b_initial + 1) * (b_initial + 1)) + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `m` is the second positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `b` is `b_initial + 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b_initial) // (b_initial * b_initial) + (n + b_initial + 1) // ((b_initial + 1) * (b_initial + 1)) + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `t`**.
