The code snippet converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. This affects the types of `n` and `m` but does not change their values in terms of the numbers they represent. The variables `t`, `ans`, and `T` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them directly.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input, `m` is the second positive integer from the input, `ans` is `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is `T + 1`.**
In natural language: The value of `t` remains greater than 0. The variables `n` and `m` are now integers representing the first and second positive integers from the input, respectively. The value of `ans` remains as `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The value of `T` remains `T + 1`.
