Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis:
Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for all possible pairs where \(b > 1\). It should be initialized to 0 and then count all valid pairs including those where \(b = 1\).
2. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from 2 to `min(n, m)`. However, it should also consider the case when \(b = 1\). When \(b = 1\), every pair \((a, 1)\) is valid because \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\). Thus, there are `n` valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs for each \(b\). The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked for each \(a\) and \(b\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done efficiently using the properties of gcd and some mathematical insights, but the provided code does not implement this correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
