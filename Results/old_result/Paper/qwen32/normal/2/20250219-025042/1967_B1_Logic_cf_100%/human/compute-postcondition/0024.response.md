To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the first positive integer from the input.
- `m` is the second positive integer from the input.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
- `T` is assigned the value of `t`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is computed as follows:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \times b} \right\rfloor \]

Where:
- \( \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) denotes the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer.
- The summation runs from \( b = 2 \) to \( b = \min(n, m) \).

### Explanation:
1. **Value of `n`**: This is the first positive integer from the input.
2. **Value of `m`**: This is the second positive integer from the input.
3. **Summation Term**: For each \( b \) from 2 to \( \min(n, m) \), the term \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \times b} \right\rfloor\) is calculated and summed up.
4. **Final `ans`**: The result of the summation is added to `n`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the computed value of `ans` based on the input values of `n` and `m`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is n plus the sum of floor((n + b) / (b * b)) for b from 2 to min(n, m))**
