The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Since `b` was incremented by 1 before this line, we need to reflect that in our calculation.

Let's denote the initial value of `b` as `b_initial`. After `b` is incremented by 1, its new value becomes `b_initial + 1`.

The initial value of `ans` is given as `n + (n + b_initial) // (b_initial * b_initial)`. After executing the code snippet, `ans` is updated to:

\[ \text{new\_ans} = \left(n + \frac{n + b_{\text{initial}}}{b_{\text{initial}} \times b_{\text{initial}}}\right) + \left(\frac{n + (b_{\text{initial}} + 1)}{(b_{\text{initial}} + 1) \times (b_{\text{initial}} + 1)}\right) \]

Since `b` is now `b_initial + 1`, the output state reflects this change in `b` and the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `m` is the second positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `b` is `b_initial + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n + b_initial) // (b_initial * b_initial) + (n + b_initial + 1) // ((b_initial + 1) * (b_initial + 1))`, `T` is `t`**.
