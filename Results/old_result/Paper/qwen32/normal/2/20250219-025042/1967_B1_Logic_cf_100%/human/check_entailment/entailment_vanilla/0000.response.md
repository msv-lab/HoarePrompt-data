Let's analyze the problem and the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem but seems to have some issues in its logic.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`.
3. It initializes `ans` with `n`, which is not clear why.
4. It then iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
5. Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The initialization of `ans` with `n` does not align with the problem requirements. The number of valid pairs should be calculated from scratch for each test case.
2. **Logic inside the loop:** The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs for each `b`. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be properly checked for each pair \((a, b)\).
3. **Range of `b`:** The loop runs from 2 to `min(n, m)`, but it should consider `b` from 1 to `m` as per the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops, but due to the constraints, an optimized approach might be necessary.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
Correctness: **False**
