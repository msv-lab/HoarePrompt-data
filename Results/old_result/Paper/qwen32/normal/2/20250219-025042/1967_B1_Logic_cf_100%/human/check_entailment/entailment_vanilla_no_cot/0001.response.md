Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations

- For \(b = 1\), \(a + b = a + 1\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\). Hence, every pair \((a, 1)\) satisfies the condition. There are \(n\) such pairs.
- For \(b > 1\), we need \(a + b\) to be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes \(dx + dy = d(x + y)\) must be divisible by \(d \cdot d = d^2\). Simplifying, \(x + y\) must be divisible by \(d\).

### Correct Approach

To count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\):
- Iterate through each possible value of \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
- For each \(b\), iterate through possible values of \(d\) (divisors of \(b\)).
- For each \(d\), count how many valid \(a\) values exist such that \(a + b\) is divisible by \(d^2\).

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the above logic. Specifically:
- It initializes `ans` with `n`, which correctly counts the number of pairs when \(b = 1\).
- For \(b > 1\), it incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. This formula does not correctly account for the requirement that \(x + y\) must be divisible by \(d\).

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
