The code snippet reassigns the values of `c` and `d` to the values returned by the function `r()`. This means the previous values of `c` and `d` are overwritten by the new values returned by `r()`. The relationship between `c` and `d` (whether `c` is less than `d` or not) is determined by the new values returned by `r()`.

Output State: **`u` is 1, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
