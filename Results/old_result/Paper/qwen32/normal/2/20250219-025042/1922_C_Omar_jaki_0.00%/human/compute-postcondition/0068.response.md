To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed in the code.

### Initial State:
- `u` is set to 1.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.
- There is a conditional statement that checks if `c` is less than `d`. If true, it confirms `c < d`; otherwise, it confirms `c >= d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `r()`**: Since the function `r()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot know the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know they are integers returned by `r()`.
2. **List `b`**: The list `b` is also not defined in the initial state, so we do not know its contents. We only know that the code accesses elements of `b` at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
3. **Indices Calculation**:
   - The index for the first element is `(d - 1) * 2`.
   - The index for the second element is `(c - 1) * 2`.
4. **Subtraction Operation**: The code subtracts the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

### Output Description:
Given the lack of specific values for `c`, `d`, and the list `b`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

- The output will be the difference between the elements at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Thus, the final output can be described as:

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where `b` is the list, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, and the indices are calculated as `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` respectively)**
