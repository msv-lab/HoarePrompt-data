Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `t` is the integer value returned by `r()`, satisfying \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\).
- `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.
- `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, (y - x) + v]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

The code snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Here, `b` is being extended by two new elements. Let's break down the expressions:

1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
   - `b[-2]` refers to the third-to-last element of `b`, which is `(y - x) + v`.
   - `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True` (which means `1`), otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since any number to the power of `0` is `1`).

2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
   - `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `(y - x) + v + v` (or simply `(y - x) + 2*v` if `v > x - w`).
   - `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True` (which means `1`), otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

So, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `(y - x) + v + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `(y - x) + 2*v + v ** (v > z - y)`

Since `v` is `y - x`, let's denote `d = y - x`. Then the new elements become:
- `d + d + d ** (d > x - w) = 2*d + d ** (d > x - w)`
- `d + 2*d + d ** (d > z - y) = 3*d + d ** (d > z - y)`

Therefore, the updated list `b` will be:
`[0, 0, d, d, 2*d, 2*d + d ** (d > x - w), 3*d + d ** (d > z - y)]`

Given that `d = y - x`, the final state of `b` is:
`[0, 0, y - x, y - x, 2*(y - x), 2*(y - x) + (y - x) ** (y - x > x - w), 3*(y - x) + (y - x) ** (y - x > z - y)]`

Output State: **`t` is the integer value returned by `r()`, satisfying \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, 2*(y - x), 2*(y - x) + (y - x) ** (y - x > x - w), 3*(y - x) + (y - x) ** (y - x > z - y)]`; `v` is `y - x`.**
