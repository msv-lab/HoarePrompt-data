Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List `b`:**
   - The list `b` is structured such that it contains pairs of repeated cumulative sums of a series of numbers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_{n-1}\).
   - Specifically, `b` looks like this:
     \[
     b = [0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, \ldots, \text{sum}(d_1, \ldots, d_{n-2}), \text{sum}(d_1, \ldots, d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]
     \]
   - This means that every even index (starting from 0) contains the cumulative sum up to that point, and every odd index contains the same cumulative sum.

2. **Variable `u`:**
   - `u` is decremented by 1 (`u = u - 1`), but this does not affect the print statement directly.

3. **Variables `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are assigned the first and second values returned by the function `r()`, respectively.
   - The relationship between `c` and `d` is determined by the return values of `r()`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

- **Index Calculation:**
  - `(d - 1) * 2` gives the index in the list `b` corresponding to the cumulative sum up to the \(d\)-th term.
  - `(c - 1) * 2` gives the index in the list `b` corresponding to the cumulative sum up to the \(c\)-th term.
  
- **Value Extraction:**
  - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` extracts the cumulative sum up to the \(d\)-th term.
  - `b[(c - 1) * 2]` extracts the cumulative sum up to the \(c\)-th term.
  
- **Subtraction:**
  - The difference between these two cumulative sums is computed, which essentially gives the sum of the terms from the \(c\)-th to the \(d\)-th term in the sequence \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_{n-1}\).

### Final Output:

The print statement will output the sum of the terms from the \(c\)-th to the \(d\)-th term in the sequence \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_{n-1}\).

Output: **sum(d_c, d_{c+1}, ..., d_d) (where d_c is the c-th term and d_d is the d-th term in the sequence d_1, d_2, ..., d_{n-1})**
