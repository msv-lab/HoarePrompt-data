In this case, the `while` loop condition is `t`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` evaluates to `True`. Since there are no specific details about what `t` represents (it could be a boolean variable, an expression, etc.), we need to ensure that `t` remains `True` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that the loop condition is simply `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is `True` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is True**
