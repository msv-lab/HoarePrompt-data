The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function does not directly affect the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, or `y_i` as they are not used within the given code snippet. It merely prepares a way to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

Given the initial state, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, or `y_i` are modified by the execution of the lambda function definition. The lambda function `r` itself is introduced as a new element in the state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, there are two integers `x_i` and `y_i` such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
