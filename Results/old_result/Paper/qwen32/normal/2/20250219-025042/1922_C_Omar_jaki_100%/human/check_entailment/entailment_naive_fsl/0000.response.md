Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the closest city logic correctly and does not compute the minimum cost to travel between cities based on the rules provided.

Here are some issues with the code:
1. The program incorrectly calculates the closest city and the associated costs. It uses a complex formula involving powers and sums, which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the closest city and travel to it for 1 coin.
2. The program does not correctly handle the logic of traveling between cities using the closest city shortcut or directly paying the distance cost.
3. The program does not correctly process the input and output the results for each query.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the provided program does not produce these outputs correctly. Let's break down why:

- For the query `1 4`, the correct path is to go from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin), then from city 2 to city 3 (1 coin), then from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), totaling 3 coins.
- For the query `1 5`, the correct path is to go from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin), then from city 2 to city 3 (1 coin), then from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), then from city 4 to city 5 (5 coins), totaling 8 coins.
- For the query `3 4`, the correct path is to go from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), totaling 1 coin.
- For the query `3 2`, the correct path is to go from city 3 to city 2 (1 coin), totaling 1 coin.
- For the query `5 1`, the correct path is to go from city 5 to city 4 (1 coin), then from city 4 to city 3 (1 coin), then from city 3 to city 2 (1 coin), then from city 2 to city 1 (8 coins), totaling 14 coins.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and fails to meet the problem's requirements.
