Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, there are two integers `x_i` and `y_i` such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so if `t` was initially between 1 and 10^4, it is now between 0 and 10^4. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
