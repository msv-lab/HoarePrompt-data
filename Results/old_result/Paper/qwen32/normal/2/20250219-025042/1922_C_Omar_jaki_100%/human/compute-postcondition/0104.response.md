To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `u` is at least 1 (though `u` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the precondition).
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.
- `b` is a list (not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `r()`**: This function returns two values, `c` and `d`. Without knowing the exact implementation of `r()`, we can only assume that `c` and `d` are integers.
2. **List `b`**: The list `b` is accessed using indices derived from `c` and `d`. Specifically, the elements at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` are accessed.
3. **Print Statement**: The difference between the elements at these two indices in the list `b` is printed.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the result of the expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.
- Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the contents of `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where c and d are the values returned by r(), and b is a list)**
