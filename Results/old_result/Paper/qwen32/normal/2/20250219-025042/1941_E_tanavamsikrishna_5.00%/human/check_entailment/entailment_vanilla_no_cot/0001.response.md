Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Problem Understanding
The goal is to build `k` bridges across consecutive rows of a grid representing a river. Each bridge must have supports installed at specific positions with certain constraints:
- Supports must be installed at the start and end of each row.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports cannot exceed `d`.
- The cost of installing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.

The objective is to find the configuration of `k` consecutive rows where the total cost of installing supports is minimized.

#### Program Breakdown

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d-1` cells by adding `1` to their depth values.
   - For each subsequent cell, it calculates the cost by taking the minimum cost among the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds `1` to the depth of the current cell.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which represents the total cost of building a bridge on that row under the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the grid of depths.
   - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then iterates through all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and calculates the total cost for each set.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that supports must be placed at the start and end of each row.
   - The function only considers the minimum cost among the previous `d` cells, which might not include the cost of placing a support at the start or end of the row.
   - The function also does not ensure that the distance constraint between supports is respected.

2. **Handling of Constraints**:
   - The function does not explicitly enforce the requirement that supports must be placed at the start and end of each row.
   - It also does not handle the distance constraint between supports correctly.

3. **Optimization**:
   - The function calculates the cost for each row independently without considering the interaction between rows when building multiple bridges.
   - It does not use dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to efficiently find the minimum cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program, particularly the incorrect handling of the constraints and the lack of proper optimization, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
