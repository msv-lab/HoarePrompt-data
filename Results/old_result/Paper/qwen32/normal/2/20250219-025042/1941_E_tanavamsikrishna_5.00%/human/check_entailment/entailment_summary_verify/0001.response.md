### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. Let's break down the issues and verify the correctness of the program:

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row with supports placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- **Implementation Flaw**: The current implementation does not ensure that supports are placed such that the distance constraint `d` is respected. Instead, it merely considers the minimum cost within the previous `d` columns, which does not guarantee that the distance between supports is within `d`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement `func_1`, we need a dynamic programming approach that ensures the distance constraint is respected. Here’s a sketch of how it could be done:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize a DP array `dp[j]` where `dp[j]` represents the minimum cost to place a support at column `j`.
2. **Base Case**: Set `dp[0] = 1` because there is always a support at the first column.
3. **Transition**: For each column `j`, compute `dp[j]` by considering the minimum cost of placing a support at any column `i` such that `j - i <= d + 1` and adding the cost of placing a support at column `j`.
4. **Result**: The value `dp[m-1]` will give the minimum cost to place supports from the first column to the last column while respecting the distance constraint.

Here’s a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    m = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * m
    dp[0] = 1  # Cost to place a support at the first column
    for j in range(1, m):
        for i in range(max(0, j - d), j + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + row[j] + 1)
    return dp[m - 1]
```

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Handle multiple test cases, read input, calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation**: The logic here seems correct once `func_1` is properly implemented. It reads the input, calculates the cost for each row, and finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that `func_1` does not correctly handle the distance constraint `d`. Therefore, the program as provided is incorrect.

**Final: False**
