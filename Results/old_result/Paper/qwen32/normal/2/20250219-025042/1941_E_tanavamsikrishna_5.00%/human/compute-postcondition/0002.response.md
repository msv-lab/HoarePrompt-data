The code snippet creates a new list called `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the `rows` list, using `d` as an additional argument. This means that for each row in `rows`, `func_1(row, d)` is computed and the results are collected into the `costs` list.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `costs`, which is now a list containing the results of applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with `d` as the second argument.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers representing the depth in each cell; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.**
