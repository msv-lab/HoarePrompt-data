To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0. This means `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

2. **Initialization of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as the `range` function in Python starts from 0 by default.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - `costs` is a list that contains the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`. Therefore, `len(costs)` is equal to the number of rows in `rows`, which is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` (the number of rows) must be at least `k`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `n` (the number of rows) is at least `k`, ensuring that `len(costs)` is also at least `k`.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list with at least `k` sublists, each containing `m` integers; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and has at least `k` elements; `total_costs` is an empty list; `i` is 0**
