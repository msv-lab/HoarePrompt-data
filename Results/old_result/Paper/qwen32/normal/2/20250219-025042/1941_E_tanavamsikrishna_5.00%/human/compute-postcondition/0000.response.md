The code snippet provided reads four space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. This means that the values of these variables will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` were described as integers representing specific aspects of the grid and bridges. After executing the code, these variables will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input, representing the number of rows, number of columns, number of bridges, and maximum distance between supports respectively; `rows` is a 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers representing the depth in each cell.**
