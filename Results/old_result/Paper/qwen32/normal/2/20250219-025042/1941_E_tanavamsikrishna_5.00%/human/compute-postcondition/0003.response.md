Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers representing the depth in each cell; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change is that `total_costs` has been initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
