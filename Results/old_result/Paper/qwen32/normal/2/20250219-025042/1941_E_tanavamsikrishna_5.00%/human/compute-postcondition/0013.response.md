Functionality: **The function calculates the minimum cost required to build a specified number of bridges (`k`) across a grid, where each bridge spans over a contiguous segment of cells in a row, and the cost is determined by the depths of the cells within the segment. The function prints the minimum cost among all possible segments of length `k` for each row.**
