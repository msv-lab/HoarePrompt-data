Output State: **The program returns the last element of the modified `row` list, which is calculated as `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1` for `i = len(row) - 1`.**

To break it down simply: The last element of `row` is computed based on the minimum value of a segment of `row` before it, adjusted by adding the current value of the last element and 1.
