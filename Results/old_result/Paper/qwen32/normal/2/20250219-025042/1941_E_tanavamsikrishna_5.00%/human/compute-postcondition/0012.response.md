Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `k` (number of bridges), and `d` (maximum distance between supports). It also accepts a 2D list `rows` where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers representing the depth in each cell. The function evaluates these parameters to determine if it's possible to build the specified number of bridges within the given constraints and returns a result indicating whether the construction is feasible or not.**
