Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
- Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column.
- Supports must be installed at the first and last columns, and the cost of installing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

### Analysis of the Code:
#### Function `func_1`:
This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
- It initializes the cost for the first `d-1` columns directly.
- For each subsequent column, it computes the cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` columns and adds the current cell's cost plus one.
- Finally, it returns the cost of the last column, which represents the total cost of building a bridge on that row.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
- It reads the grid of depths.
- It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- It then iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows, sums their costs, and keeps track of the minimum total cost.
- Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for placing supports with the constraint that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. It simply considers the minimum cost within the previous `d` columns without ensuring that supports are placed such that the distance constraint is satisfied.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach Needed:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach is needed. Specifically, for each cell `(i, j)`, we should consider the minimum cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as per the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness:** **False**
