### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand if the solution meets the requirements.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid.
- Each bridge spans the entire width of the grid (from column 1 to column `m`).
- Supports must be placed at every cell `(i, 1)` and `(i, m)`.
- Supports can also be placed at other cells `(i, j)` with a cost of `a_{i,j} + 1`.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- We need to minimize the total cost of building these `k` bridges.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a single bridge on a given row.
   - It ensures that supports are placed at the first and last columns.
   - For each cell in the row, it calculates the cost considering the constraint on the distance between supports.
   - The final cost for the row is the value of the last cell after processing.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the main logic for each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the number of bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).
   - It reads the grid values into a 2D list `rows`.
   - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

#### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Support Placement:** The function `func_1` ensures that supports are placed at the first and last columns and calculates the cost considering the distance constraint.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost for each row is correctly calculated, and the total cost for `k` consecutive rows is computed.
- **Minimum Cost Selection:** The function correctly identifies the minimum cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
