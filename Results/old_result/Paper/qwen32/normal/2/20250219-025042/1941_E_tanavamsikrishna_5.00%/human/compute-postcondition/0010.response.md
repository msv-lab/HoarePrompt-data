To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what it accomplishes. The loop iterates over the `costs` list, summing up every possible contiguous sub-list of length `k` and appending these sums to the `total_costs` list.

The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(costs) - k`. This means the loop will run `len(costs) - k + 1` times.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, after all iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sums of all contiguous sub-lists of length `k` from the `costs` list. Specifically, `total_costs` will contain the sums of `costs[0:k]`, `costs[1:k+1]`, ..., `costs[len(costs)-k:len(costs)]`.

Thus, the final state of `total_costs` will be a list of these sums.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sums of all contiguous sub-lists of length `k` from the `costs` list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `total_costs` will hold the sum of every possible group of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
