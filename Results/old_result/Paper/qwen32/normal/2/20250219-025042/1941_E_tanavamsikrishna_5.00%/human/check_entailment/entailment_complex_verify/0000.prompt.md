You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

def func_1(row, d):

        row[i] = row[i] + 1

    #State: The first `d - 1` elements of `row` are each incremented by 2, and for each element `row[i]` where `i >= d - 1`, `row[i]` is updated to `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`.

    #The program returns the last element of the modified `row` list, which is calculated as `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1` for `i = len(row) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list of non-negative integers (`row`) by incrementing the first `d - 1` elements by 1, and then updating each subsequent element based on the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus the current element value plus 1. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of rows in the grid, m is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, k is an integer representing the number of bridges, and d is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains m integers representing the depth in each cell.

    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of any contiguous sub-list of length k from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the minimum cost required to build a specified number of bridges (`k`) across a grid, where each bridge spans over a contiguous segment of cells in a row, and the cost is determined by the depths of the cells within the segment. The function prints the minimum cost among all possible segments of length `k` for each row.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to calculate the cost of building a bridge on a single row considering the constraints. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the placement of supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

   Specifically, the current implementation incorrectly adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements and then calculates the rest based on the minimum value in a sliding window of size `d+1`. This approach does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally according to the problem constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row, and then tries to find the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the results from `func_2` will also be incorrect.

### Counterexample

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
- For the first row `[0, 1, 2, 1, 0]`, the optimal placement of supports would be at positions 1, 3, and 5, resulting in a cost of `0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.
- Similarly, for the other rows, the optimal placement would also result in a cost of 4.

However, the provided code would likely not produce the correct result due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the code, it is clear that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
