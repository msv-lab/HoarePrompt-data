### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` is intended to compute the cost of placing supports on a single row such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. The function modifies the row by adding 1 to the first `d-1` elements and then calculates the rest based on the minimum value in a sliding window of size `d+1`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the function:
1. **Initialization**: The first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1.
2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each element starting from index `d-1` to the end of the row, the element is updated to the minimum value in the previous `d` elements plus the current element value plus 1.

The key point here is whether this approach correctly places supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
The function `func_2` reads the input, applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row, and then finds the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges.

### Issues with the Implementation:
1. **Incorrect Placement of Supports**: The function `func_1` does not guarantee that the supports are placed optimally. It simply increments the first `d-1` elements and then uses a sliding window approach to calculate the rest. This does not ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in `func_1` does not account for the actual placement of supports. It only ensures that the values are updated based on the minimum value in a sliding window, which does not necessarily reflect the optimal placement of supports.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

The expected output is `4`, as the optimal placement of supports for each row would be at positions 1, 3, and 5, resulting in a cost of `0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.

However, the provided code would likely not produce the correct result due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally according to the problem constraints, and consequently, the results from `func_2` are also incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
