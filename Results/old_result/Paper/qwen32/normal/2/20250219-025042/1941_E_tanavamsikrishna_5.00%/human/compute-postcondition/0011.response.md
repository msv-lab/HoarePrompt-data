To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `total_costs` is a list that contains the sums of all contiguous sub-lists of length `k` from the `costs` list.

This means that `total_costs` is populated by iterating over the `costs` list and calculating the sum of every possible sub-list that has exactly `k` elements. Each of these sums is then added to the `total_costs` list.

The `min(total_costs)` function call will find the smallest value among all the sums stored in the `total_costs` list.

Since the specific contents of the `costs` list and the value of `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, we know that it represents the smallest sum of any contiguous sub-list of length `k` from the `costs` list.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of any contiguous sub-list of length k from the costs list)**
