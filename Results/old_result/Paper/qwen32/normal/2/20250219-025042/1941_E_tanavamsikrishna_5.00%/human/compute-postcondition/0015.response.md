Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `row`, which is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and a parameter `d`, which is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. It calculates the last element of the modified `row` list using the formula `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1` where `i` is the index of the last element in `row`, and returns this calculated value.**
