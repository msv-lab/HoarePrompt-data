To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is `i` in this case. The loop condition is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least `k`
- `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers
- `rows` is a 2D list with at least `k` sublists, each containing `m` integers
- `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and has at least `k` elements
- `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`
- `i` is 0

Let's analyze the loop condition:
- The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, `total_costs`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list with at least `k` sublists, each containing `m` integers; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and has at least `k` elements; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `i` is 1**
