### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and its functions to see if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row of the grid, considering the constraints on the placement of supports.
- **Execution Summary**: It iterates through the row, modifying each element based on the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus the current element value plus 1. This ensures that the cost reflects the requirement that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- **Output**: The function returns the last element of the modified list, which represents the total cost for building the bridge on that row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function handles the overall problem by reading the input, processing each row using `func_1`, and then finding the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
- **Execution Summary**:
  - It reads the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - It reads the grid of depths.
  - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It calculates the total cost for each possible segment of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among these totals.
- **Output**: The function prints the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for placing supports on a single row according to the rules provided.
  - It ensures that the first and last supports are always placed (since the first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1, and the rest are calculated based on the minimum of the previous `d` elements).
  - The cost calculation adheres to the requirement that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each row using `func_1`.
  - It then calculates the total cost for each possible segment of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among these totals.
  - This approach ensures that the solution considers all possible positions for the `k` consecutive bridges and selects the one with the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to correctly solve the problem as described. The program reads the input, calculates the cost for each row, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
