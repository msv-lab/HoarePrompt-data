The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`) are modified by the `continue` statement. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that equals 2; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
