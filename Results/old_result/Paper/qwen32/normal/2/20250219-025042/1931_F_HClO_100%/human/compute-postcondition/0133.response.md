In this case, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state mentions `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **yes**
