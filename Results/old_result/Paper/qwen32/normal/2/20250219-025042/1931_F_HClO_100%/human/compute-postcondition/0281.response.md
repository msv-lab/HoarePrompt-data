Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop is exited without further processing.
