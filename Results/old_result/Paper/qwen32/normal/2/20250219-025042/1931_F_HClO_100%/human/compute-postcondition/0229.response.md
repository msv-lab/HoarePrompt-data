The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that `val` now contains this new tuple as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is `[(a3, l3)]`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. If `l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2)`, then `l` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.**
