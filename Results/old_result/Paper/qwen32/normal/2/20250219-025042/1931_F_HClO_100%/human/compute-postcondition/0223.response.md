The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This operation affects `l1` by adding one element to it.

Given the initial state, the variables `i`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged because they are not involved in the insertion operation. The only change is in `l1`.

Since `idx2` is not `-1`, `a1` is inserted at a specific position within `l1`. The exact new state of `l1` depends on its original contents and the value of `idx2`, but we know that `l1` will have one more element than before.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Additionally, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
