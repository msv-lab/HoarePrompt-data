Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. The loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration without changing the values of any variables. Thus, the values of `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged.
