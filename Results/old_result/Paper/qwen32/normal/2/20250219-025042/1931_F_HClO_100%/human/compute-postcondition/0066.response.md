The given Python code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, and `idx1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `i` is 5; `idx1` is 5; `p1` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
