Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the following conditions apply: if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is 0 and `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, no changes occur to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no change occurs. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 1 and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is 1 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of with `idx1` and `idx2` both set to 2. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
