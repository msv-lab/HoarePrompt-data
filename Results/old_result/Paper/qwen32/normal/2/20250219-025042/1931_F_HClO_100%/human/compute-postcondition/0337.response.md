The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the position `idx1`. This operation shifts all elements from `idx1` onwards one position to the right.

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `idx1` and `idx2` are indices related to mismatches or specific conditions.
- `p1` and `p2` are some parameters or indices.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1 < idx2`.

After the insertion:
- The list `l2` will have an additional element at position `idx1`.
- The length of `l2` will increase by 1.
- All elements in `l2` that were originally at or after `idx1` will now be at positions one greater than their original positions.

Since the exact contents of `l2` and the value of `a2` are not specified, we cannot provide the new contents of `l2`. However, we can describe the changes to the indices and the list structure.

Output State: **`l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, increasing its length by 1; `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged relative to their positions in `l2` before the insertion; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` remains an empty list.**
