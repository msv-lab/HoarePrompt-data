The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. This means `l` now holds the same list as `l1`, which includes the element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `idx1` is greater than `idx2`
- `idx1` is not `-1`
- `idx2` is `n - 2` if it was `-1` before the insertion, otherwise `idx2` remains the same
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged
- `val` remains an empty list
- `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`

After the assignment, `l` is now equal to `l1`, so it also has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.

Output State: **`idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was `-1` before the insertion, otherwise `idx2` remains the same; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` remains an empty list; `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`; `l` is equal to `l1`.**
