You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n people in the programming contest chat. Chat participants are
ordered by activity, but each person sees himself at the top of the list.

For example, there are 4 participants in the chat, and their order is [2, 3,
1, 4] . Then

  * 1 -st user sees the order [1, 2, 3, 4] . 
  * 2 -nd user sees the order [2, 3, 1, 4] . 
  * 3 -rd user sees the order [3, 2, 1, 4] . 
  * 4 -th user sees the order [4, 2, 3, 1] . 

k people posted screenshots in the chat, which show the order of participants
shown to this user. The screenshots were taken within a short period of time,
and the order of participants has not changed.

Your task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all
screenshots correspond to.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers n
and k (1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted
screenshots.

The following k lines contain descriptions of screenshots posted by the
participants.

The i -th row contains n integers a_{ij} each (1 \le a_{ij} \le n , all a_{ij}
are different) — the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0} ,
where a_{i0} — the author of the screenshot. You can show that in the
screenshot description it will always be at the top of the list.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot k for all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . It is also guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots
are different.

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
an answer, output "YES" if there exists at least one order of participants,
under which all k screenshots could have been obtained. Otherwise, output
"NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and a series of screenshots showing the order of participants. It checks if it's possible to reorder the participants in a consistent manner across all screenshots such that the order of non-author participants is the same in every screenshot, allowing for one swap involving the authors. If this condition is met for all test cases, it outputs 'yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze whether it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Let's go through the code and see if it meets all the requirements.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Handling Single Screenshot Case (`m == 1`)**:
   - If only one screenshot is provided (`m == 1`), the program immediately prints "YES". This is correct because there's no contradiction possible with a single screenshot.

2. **Comparison of Two Screenshots**:
   - For `m >= 2`, the program reads the first two screenshots and compares their lists excluding the author's ID.
   - If the lists excluding the author's ID do not match, it prints "NO" and skips further checks.
   - If they match, it tries to find the position where the authors' IDs (`a1` and `a2`) appear in the lists and adjusts the lists accordingly.

3. **Handling More Than Two Screenshots**:
   - For more than two screenshots, it processes the remaining screenshots and checks if they match the adjusted list (excluding the author's ID).
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "NO".
   - If all screenshots match, it prints "YES".

### Potential Issues:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program seems to handle the basic cases well, but let's consider some edge cases:
     - **All Participants Post Screenshots**: When `k == n`, the program needs to ensure that the order is consistent across all screenshots.
     - **Participants Post Screenshots in Reverse Order**: The program should handle cases where participants post screenshots in reverse order of their actual positions.
     - **Participants Post Screenshots in Random Order**: The program should handle cases where participants post screenshots in random order but still maintain consistency.

2. **Complexity Considerations**:
   - The program uses a linear scan to compare lists, which is efficient given the constraints (`n * k <= 2 * 10^5`).

### Testing the Program:

Let's test the program with a few edge cases to ensure it works correctly:

#### Test Case 1:
```
2
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
```
- Expected Output: `YES`
- Explanation: Both screenshots are consistent with the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

#### Test Case 2:
```
2
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Explanation: The second screenshot contradicts the first one.

#### Test Case 3:
```
3
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 2 1 4 5
```
- Expected Output: `YES`
- Explanation: All screenshots are consistent with the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

#### Test Case 4:
```
3
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 5 4 2 1
```
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Explanation: The third screenshot contradicts the first two.

After testing these cases, the program seems to handle them correctly. However, let's consider a more complex case:

#### Test Case 5:
```
4
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 2 1 4 5
4 5 3 2 1
```
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Explanation: The fourth screenshot contradicts the first three.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing and testing the program with various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly determines whether there exists a consistent order of participants based on the provided screenshots. The program handles the basic cases, multiple screenshots, and edge cases efficiently.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
