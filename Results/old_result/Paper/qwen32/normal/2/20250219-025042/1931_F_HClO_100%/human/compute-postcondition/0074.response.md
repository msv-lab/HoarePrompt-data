To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop progresses and modifies the variables based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times.
- The loop breaks if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`.
- Inside the loop, if `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, it checks further conditions:
  - If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and the loop breaks.
  - Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1.
  - If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1.
  - If both `idx1` and `idx2` become non-negative, the loop breaks.

### Given States:
- After 1 iteration: No changes to `idx1` and `idx2` if `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` is 1, no changes if `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` is 2, `p1` and `p2` are 1, no changes if `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`.

### Final State:
- The loop will continue until one of the breaking conditions is met.
- If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` at any point, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to `i`, and the loop will terminate.
- If `idx1` and `idx2` both become non-negative (i.e., both `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` at different points), the loop will also terminate.
- If none of these conditions are met within `n - 1` iterations, the loop will run until `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
Assuming the loop does not encounter the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` within the first `n - 1` iterations, the loop will run until `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. At this point, `i` will be `n - 2 - max(p1, p2)` and `max(p1, p2)` will be 1 (as per the third iteration state).

Thus, the final state of the loop will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`.**

This means that the loop has completed all iterations without finding a pair `(a2, a1)` at the same index offset in `l1` and `l2`, and `p1` and `p2` remain 1, indicating that `a2` and `a1` were found at some previous indices but not at the current offset.
