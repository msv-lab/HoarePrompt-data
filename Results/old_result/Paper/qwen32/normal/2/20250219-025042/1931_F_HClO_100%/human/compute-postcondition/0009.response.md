The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, assigns the first integer to `a2`, and the rest to `l2`. 

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input; if `m` is 1, then `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new input line.
- `l2` is assigned the list of the remaining integers from the new input line.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input; if `m` is 1, then `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line.**
