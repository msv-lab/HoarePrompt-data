The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `val`. This action does not affect the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where the first mismatch occurs with the specified conditions, or the loop will break when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. The exact values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` depend on the specific values in `l1` and `l2`; `val` is an empty list.**
