Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their values from the initial state.
