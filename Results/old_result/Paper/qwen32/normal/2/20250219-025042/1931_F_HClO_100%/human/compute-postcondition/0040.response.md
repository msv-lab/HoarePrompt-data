Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` remains -1, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` remains 0. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` remains 0, and `p2` is set to 1. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is either equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` at this point. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
