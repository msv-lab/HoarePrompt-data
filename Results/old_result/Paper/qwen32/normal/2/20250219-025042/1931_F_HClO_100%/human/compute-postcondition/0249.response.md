The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. This string is explicitly provided in the `print` function and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides details about several variables (`i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `a3_next`, `l3_next`), but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
