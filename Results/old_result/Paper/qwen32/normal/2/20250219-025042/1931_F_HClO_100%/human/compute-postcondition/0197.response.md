Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `n`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. The condition for breaking out of the loop (i.e., `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`) is met, leading to the exit of the loop.
