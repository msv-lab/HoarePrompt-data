The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentioned does not affect the execution of this code snippet because the given code does not depend on any pre-existing values of `n` and `m`. The only change is that `n` and `m` are now assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'; `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input.**
