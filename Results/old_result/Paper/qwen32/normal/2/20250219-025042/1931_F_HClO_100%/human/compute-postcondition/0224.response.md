The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same value as `l1`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `l` which now points to the same list that `l1` does. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, and `l` is equal to `l1`.**
