The code snippet creates a new list `l11` that contains elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`. This means that if `a2` was present in `l1`, it will no longer be in `l11`.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input. If `m` is equal to 1, the same state is maintained. Otherwise, the same state is also maintained since there is no else part to alter the state. `a1` is the first integer from the input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. `a2` is the first integer from the new input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.**
