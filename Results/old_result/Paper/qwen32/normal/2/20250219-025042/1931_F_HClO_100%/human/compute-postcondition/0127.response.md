Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` contains `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`; `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `a3` is the next `a3_next` from `val`; `l3` is the next `l3_next` from `val`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
