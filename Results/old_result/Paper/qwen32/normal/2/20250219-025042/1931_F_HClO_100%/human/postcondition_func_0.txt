The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and a series of screenshots showing the order of participants. It checks if it's possible to reorder the participants in a consistent manner across all screenshots such that the order of non-author participants is the same in every screenshot, allowing for one swap involving the authors. If this condition is met for all test cases, it outputs 'yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'no'.
