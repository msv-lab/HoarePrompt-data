The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 1, `p1` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
