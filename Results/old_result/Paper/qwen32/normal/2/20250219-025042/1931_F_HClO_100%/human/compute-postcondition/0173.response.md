The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition `n > 1` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
