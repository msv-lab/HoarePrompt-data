The `continue` statement in Python does not affect the values of variables; it only affects the flow of control within loops by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input; `m` is 1.**
