Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where the first mismatch occurs with the specified conditions, or the loop will break when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, increasing its length by 1; `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged; `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged; `val` remains an empty list; `l` is a reference to `l2`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set according to the specified conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, and `val` is either an empty list or `[(a3, l3)]`. Depending on the conditions, `l1` may have `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `l2` may have `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is set accordingly. If `idx1 <= idx2`, `m` is decreased by 1.**
