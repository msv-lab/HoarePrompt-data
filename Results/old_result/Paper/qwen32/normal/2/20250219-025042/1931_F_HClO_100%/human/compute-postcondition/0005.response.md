Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `m` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables; it directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given information and the code snippet, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
