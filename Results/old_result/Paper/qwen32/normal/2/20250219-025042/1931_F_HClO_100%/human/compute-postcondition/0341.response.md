The given code snippet inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the position `idx2`. This operation will modify the list `l1` by adding one more element at the specified index, shifting all subsequent elements to the right.

Given the initial state, the only variable that will be directly affected is `l1` because an element is being inserted into it. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was `-1` before the insertion, otherwise `idx2` remains the same; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` remains an empty list; `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**
