Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `idx2` was `-1` and `idx1` was not `-1`, then `idx2` is updated to `n-2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx2`. If `m` is `2`, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
