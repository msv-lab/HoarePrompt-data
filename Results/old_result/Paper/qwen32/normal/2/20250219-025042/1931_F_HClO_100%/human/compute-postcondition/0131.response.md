The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` retains its value from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**
