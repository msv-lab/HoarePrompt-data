Given the initial state, the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. This means that the `print('yes')` statement is executed after the loop finishes. The variables `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, but they do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement since it only outputs the string 'yes'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs and completes all its iterations.
2. After the loop, the `print('yes')` statement is executed.
3. The `print` statement outputs the string 'yes'.

Since there are no variables or conditions affecting the string 'yes', the output is straightforward.

Output: **yes**
