The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `p2`. This change affects only `p2`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`; `idx2` is 0; `p2` is 1.**
