The code snippet provided resets the `big` list to an empty list. This change affects only the `big` variable, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count_valid_no` (or `num < 1` if this value is less than 1), and `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1.**
