Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and counts the occurrences of 'pie' again in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of the initial count of 'map' and the count of 'pie' after removing 'map'.**
