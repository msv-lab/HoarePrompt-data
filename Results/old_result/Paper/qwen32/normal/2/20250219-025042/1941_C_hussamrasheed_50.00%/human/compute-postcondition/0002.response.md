The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The other variables, `t` and `s`, remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. After executing the code, `n` will be reassigned to a new integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
