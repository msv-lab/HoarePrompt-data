The code snippet `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This affects the value of `s` and the count of 'map' in `s`, which is stored in `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged)
- `n` is the new input integer (unchanged)
- `s` is the new input string (will be modified)
- `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in `s` (will be updated)
- `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s` (unchanged for now)
- `i` is i + 1 (unchanged)

After executing `s = s.replace('map', '')`, the string `s` no longer contains 'map', and `m` should be set to 0 because all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all 'map' occurrences removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`, `i` is i + 1.**
