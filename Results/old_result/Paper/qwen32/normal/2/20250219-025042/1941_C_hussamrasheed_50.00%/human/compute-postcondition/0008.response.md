The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it was `x`), and `t` is a constant such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can generalize this by saying that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is x + 1**.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can simply say:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `x` and now it becomes `x + 1`:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is x + 1**

But since we don't know `x`, we just say:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For the sake of the format:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Simplified for the format:
