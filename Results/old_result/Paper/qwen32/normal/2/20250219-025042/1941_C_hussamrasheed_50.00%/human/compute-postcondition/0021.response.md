Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: This is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). It represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current print statement directly.
2. **`n`**: This is another input integer. Its value is not specified further in the initial state, so we'll consider it as a generic integer.
3. **`s`**: This is a new input string with all occurrences of the substring 'map' removed. The exact content of `s` after removal is dependent on the input string.
4. **`m`**: This variable is explicitly set to 0.
5. **`p`**: This variable is set to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.
6. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). However, since `i` is not used in the print statement, its value is irrelevant to the output.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(m + p)
```

- **`m`**: As per the initial state, `m` is explicitly set to 0.
- **`p`**: This variable holds the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string `s`.

### Calculation:

The expression `m + p` simplifies to `0 + p`, which is just `p`. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `p`.

### Final Output Description:

The output of the print statement is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s` (after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed).

Output: **p (where p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string s after removing all occurrences of 'map')**
