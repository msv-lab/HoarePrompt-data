### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- **Objective**: Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for excursions.
- **Output**: The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers. The result should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).
- **Key Points**:
  - Total possible pairs: \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
  - Friendship values increase by 1 each time a pair is chosen.
  - Expected value calculation involves considering both friend and non-friend pairs.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case (\( n \), \( m \), \( k \)).
   - It also correctly reads the details of each pair of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculating `sum_f`**:
   - `sum_f` is the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends. This part is correct.

3. **Calculating `cn2`**:
   - `cn2` is the total number of possible pairs of children, calculated as \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This part is correct.

4. **Calculating `p` and `q`**:
   - The formulas used for `p` and `q` are:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot cn2^2
     \]
   - These formulas do not align with the correct expected value calculation. Let's derive the correct formulas.

#### Correct Expected Value Calculation:
To derive the correct expected value, we need to consider:
- The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in any given excursion.
- The contribution of each pair of friends to the expected sum over \( k \) excursions.
- The contribution of non-friend pairs, which is zero.

**Probability of Choosing a Specific Pair**:
- The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

**Contribution of a Friend Pair**:
- A pair of friends with initial friendship value \( f \) contributes to the expected sum as follows:
  - In the first excursion, the contribution is \( f \).
  - In the second excursion, the contribution is \( f + 1 \).
  - ...
  - In the \( k \)-th excursion, the contribution is \( f + k - 1 \).
- The expected contribution of a friend pair over \( k \) excursions is:
  \[
  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (f + i) = k \cdot f + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
  \]
- Since the probability of choosing this pair in any given excursion is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\), the total expected contribution of this pair over \( k \) excursions is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \left( k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right) = \frac{2kf}{n(n-1)} + \frac{k(k-1)}{n(n-1)}
  \]

**Summing Over All Friend Pairs**:
- Summing over all \( m \) friend pairs, the total expected sum is:
  \[
  \sum_{j=1}^{m} \left( \frac{2kf_j}{n(n-1)} + \frac{k(k-1)}{n(n-1)} \right) = \frac{2k \sum_{j=1}^{m} f_j}{n(n-1)} + \frac{mk(k-1)}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  \frac{2k \cdot sum_f + mk(k-1)}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- Here, \( p = 2k \cdot sum_f + mk(k-1) \) and \( q = n(n-1) \).

#### Comparison with Program Formulas:
- The program uses:
  \[
  p = 2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
  \]
  \[
  q = 2 \cdot cn2^2
  \]
- Substituting \( cn2 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), we get:
  \[
  p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) = k \cdot n(n-1) \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
  \]
  \[
  q = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{2}
  \]
- These formulas do not match the derived correct formulas.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values due to incorrect formulas for `p` and `q`. The derived correct formulas are different from those used in the program.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
