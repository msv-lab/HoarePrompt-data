The code snippet calculates the value of `q` using the formula `2 * cn2 ** 2`. Given that `cn2` is already calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, the new value of `q` will be `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`**.
