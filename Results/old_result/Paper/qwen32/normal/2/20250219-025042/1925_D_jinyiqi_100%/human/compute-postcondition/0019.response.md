The code snippet divides `p` by `gcd`. This means the value of `p` will be updated to its simplified form relative to `q` since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `p`, which is now `p // gcd`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
