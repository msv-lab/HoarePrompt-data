Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read as inputs. `sum_f` is the cumulative sum of `f` values for the `m` edges provided in that iteration. `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. `p` is computed as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, and `q` is computed as `2 * cn2 // gcd`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`. The final output for each iteration is `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, which is printed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of edges with their associated `f` values. The result for each test case is printed modulo `M`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` are recalculated for each test case, while `t` remains constant throughout the execution.
