The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `a`, `b`, and `f` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input.**
