Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. This expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total Possible Pairs**: For `n` children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship Value Increase**: When a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to consider the probability of choosing a pair and how the friendship values evolve over `k` excursions.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of friend pairs with their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program calculates the sum of all initial friendship values (`sum_f`).

3. **Total Possible Pairs**:
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs using the formula \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

4. **Calculating `p` and `q`**:
   - The program calculates `p` and `q` based on the formula derived from the problem statement.
   - `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Modular Inverse and Output**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the result as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is the incorrect formula used for calculating `p` and `q`. The provided formula does not accurately represent the expected value calculation for the given problem. 

The correct approach involves understanding the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions and properly calculating the expected sum of friendship values. The provided formula seems to be an oversimplification and does not account for the dynamic nature of friendship value increases.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect formula used for `p` and `q`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
