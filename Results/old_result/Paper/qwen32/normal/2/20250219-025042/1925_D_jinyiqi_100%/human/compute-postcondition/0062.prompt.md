Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9. All pairs (`a_i`, `b_i`) are distinct. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of `k` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `M` is 10
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    sum_f = 0
    for j in range(m):
        a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f += f
    cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
    p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
    q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
    gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
    p = p // gcd
    q = q // gcd
    print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations, `j` is `2m - 1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
