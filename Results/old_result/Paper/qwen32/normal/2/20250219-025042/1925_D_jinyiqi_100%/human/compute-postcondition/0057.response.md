The code snippet updates the value of `q` to `2 * cn2 ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, the new value of `q` will be `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
