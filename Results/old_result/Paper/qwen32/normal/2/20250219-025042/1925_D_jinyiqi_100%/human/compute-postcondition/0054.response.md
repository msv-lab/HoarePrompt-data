To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider how the loop updates its variables based on the given code snippet. The loop iterates `m` times, and during each iteration, it reads three integers (`a`, `b`, `f`), adds `f` to `sum_f`, and updates `j`. After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `m-1`.

Here's the breakdown of the final state:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `i`: Remains unchanged as it is set to 2 initially and never modified within the loop.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is the first integer from the new input and never modified within the loop.
- `m`: Remains unchanged as it is the second integer from the new input and controls the number of iterations.
- `k`: Remains unchanged as it is the third integer from the new input and never modified within the loop.
- `sum_f`: Accumulates the sum of `f` values read during each iteration. After `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values provided in the input.
- `j`: At the end of the loop, `j` will be `m-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `m-1`.
- `a`, `b`, `f`: These variables will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `cn2`: Remains unchanged as it is calculated once based on `n` and never modified within the loop.
- `p` and `q`: These are calculated based on the final value of `sum_f` and other variables. `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, and `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

Putting it all together, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all `m` iterations, `sum_f` will contain the total sum of all `f` values provided, `j` will be `m-1`, and `p` and `q` will be recalculated based on the final `sum_f` and other constants. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial values or calculations.
