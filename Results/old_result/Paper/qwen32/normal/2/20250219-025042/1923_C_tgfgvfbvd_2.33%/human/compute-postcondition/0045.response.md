The code snippet provided reads a line of input from the user, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This means that the previous value of `l` is overwritten by the new list of integers provided by the user.

Since the values of `n` and `m` are mentioned in the initial state but not modified by the given code snippet, they remain unchanged. Similarly, the lists `p` (cumulative sums) and `c` (sum of all elements in `l`) are also not affected by this code snippet and thus retain their original values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the original `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`.**
