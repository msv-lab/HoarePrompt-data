Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, with `m` being greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- Either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)` (Note: There seems to be a typo here; `s` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming this condition might refer to another variable or constraint).

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Given the print statement, it is clear that the output will be the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NO**
