Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` iterations have been completed; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has executed `m` times, with each iteration processing a pair of integers `a` and `b` provided by the user input. For each iteration, `s` is calculated as the cumulative sum from the `a-1`-th element to the `b`-th element of the list `l` if `a - 2 >= 0`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is checked, and 'YES' is printed if true, otherwise 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `m` pairs of indices `(a, b)` provided by the user. For each pair, it calculates the sum of the sublist from index `a-1` to `b` and checks if this sum is at least twice the length of the sublist. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that the loop has completed all its iterations.
