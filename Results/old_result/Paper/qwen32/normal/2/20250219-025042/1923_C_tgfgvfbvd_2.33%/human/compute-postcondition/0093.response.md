The code appends the value of `c` (which is 0) to the list `p`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one integer; `p` is a list containing the integer 0; `c` is 0**.
