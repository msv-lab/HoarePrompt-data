In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable) and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the input that will be converted to `t`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer representing `t`**.

Since the problem specifies that `t` is already given as an integer within the specified range, the primary adjustment needed is ensuring that the input provided to the program reflects this condition. No other variables in the loop head (`_`) need to be adjusted as they are automatically managed by the loop itself.
