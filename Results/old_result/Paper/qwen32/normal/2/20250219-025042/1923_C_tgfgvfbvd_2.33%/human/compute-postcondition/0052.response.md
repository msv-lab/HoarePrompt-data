The code snippet `c += x` increments the variable `c` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `x` is defined as `l[1]` if `l` has more than one element. If `l` has only one element, `x` would not be defined in the initial state, but since the problem specifies `l` has at least one integer, we assume `l` has more than one element for this operation to be valid.

Thus, `c` which was initially 0, will now be equal to `x`, which is `l[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 integer, `p` is a list containing [0], `c` is `l[1]`, `x` is `l[1]`**
