The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is initially 0, `p` will now contain one element, which is 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 integer; `p` is a list containing [0]; `c` is 0**.
