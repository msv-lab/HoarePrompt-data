Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged as it was initially. The variables `n` and `m` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in the list `l`, meaning each element in `p` represents the sum of all previous elements in `l` up to that point. Finally, `c` will hold the total sum of all the elements in the list `l`.
