Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string with length greater than or equal to 5; `count` is either 2 or 3; `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 5 if `j` was 3 and `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `j` is 4; `i` is `len(s)`. If `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `j` is updated to 5 if `j` was 3, otherwise `j` is updated to 4. If `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, then `flag` is set to True.**
