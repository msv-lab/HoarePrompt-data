The code snippet reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `s`. This means that `s` will now hold the string input provided after the initial values of `t` and `n` have been read.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100), `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is an empty list**.
