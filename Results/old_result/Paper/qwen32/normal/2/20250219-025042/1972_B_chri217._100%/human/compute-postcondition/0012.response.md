The code snippet `s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()` reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace (including the newline character), and assigns it to the variable `s`. Given that `s` was initially a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", after executing this line, `s` will be reassigned to whatever new string is read from the input, which should also be a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".

The variables `t`, `n`, and `cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100); `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100); `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input; `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**.
