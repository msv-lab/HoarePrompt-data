You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" for each test case.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each representing a pair of `(n, s)` as read from the input during each iteration.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list named `cases` which contains `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a list named `cases` which contains `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named `cases` which contains `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
