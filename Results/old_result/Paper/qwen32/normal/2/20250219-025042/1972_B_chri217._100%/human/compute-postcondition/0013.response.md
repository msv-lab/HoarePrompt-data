The code appends a new tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, but `cases` now includes an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100); `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100); `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input; `cases` is a list containing three tuples, the first being the original tuple, the second being the original `(n, s)`, and the third being the newly appended `(n, s)`**.
