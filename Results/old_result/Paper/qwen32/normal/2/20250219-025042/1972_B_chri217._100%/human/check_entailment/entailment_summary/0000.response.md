### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Game Rules**: Players take turns removing a facing-up ("U") coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. If there are only two coins left, removing one doesn't flip the remaining coin. If there is only one coin left, no flips occur. The player who cannot make a move loses.
- **Objective**: Determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.
- **Key Insight**: The critical insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by one, and the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will make the last move and win. If it's even, Bob will make the last move and win.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
   - Returns a list of tuples, each containing `(n, s)` for each test case.
   - **Output Hints**: Matches the expected behavior of reading and storing test cases.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Takes a tuple `case` containing `(n, s)`.
   - Counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`.
   - Returns 'YES' if the count of "U" is odd, otherwise returns 'NO'.
   - **Output Hints**: Matches the expected behavior of determining the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" characters.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. The key part of the solution is the determination of the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is accurately handled by `func_2`.
