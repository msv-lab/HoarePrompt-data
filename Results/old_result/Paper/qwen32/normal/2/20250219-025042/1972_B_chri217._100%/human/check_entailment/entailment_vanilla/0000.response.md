### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if it correctly determines the winner of the game.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine if Alice will win the game given the initial configuration of the coins.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
3. **Key Insight**:
   - The crucial observation here is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) determines the winner.
   - If the number of `'U'` coins is odd, Alice will always win.
   - If the number of `'U'` coins is even, Bob will always win.

This insight stems from the fact that each move reduces the number of `'U'` coins by one and flips some adjacent coins. Since the game ends when there are no `'U'` coins left, the player who starts with an odd number of `'U'` coins will always be able to make the last move.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the input and parses the test cases.
   - Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial configuration of the coins.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Takes a single test case as input.
   - Counts the number of `'U'` coins in the string `s`.
   - Returns `'YES'` if the count of `'U'` coins is odd, otherwise returns `'NO'`.

#### Verification:
- The solution correctly implements the key insight by checking the parity of the number of `'U'` coins.
- If the number of `'U'` coins is odd, it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins.
- If the number of `'U'` coins is even, it returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins.

**Correctness: True**
