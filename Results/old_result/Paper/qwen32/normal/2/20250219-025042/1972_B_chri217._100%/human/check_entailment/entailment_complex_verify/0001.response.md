### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the annotated version to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
- Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is initially odd.
- Bob wins if the number of facing-up coins is initially even.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Reads the input and returns a list of test cases.
2. `func_2(case)`: Determines the winner based on the parity of the number of 'U' characters in the string.

#### Annotations Recap:
- `func_1()` reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case, storing them in a list of tuples.
- `func_2(case)` counts the number of 'U' characters in the string and returns "YES" if the count is odd, otherwise "NO".

#### Verification:
1. **Game Dynamics**: The core insight is that the parity of the number of 'U' characters determines the winner. This is because:
   - If the number of 'U' is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of 'U' is even, leading to her eventual win.
   - If the number of 'U' is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he never faces a situation with no 'U' left, leading to his eventual win.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string using a generator expression within the `sum()` function.
   - Based on the parity of the count, it returns "YES" or "NO".

3. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the input `UUDUD`, the number of 'U' is 3 (odd), so the output should be "YES".
   - For the input `UDDUD`, the number of 'U' is 2 (even), so the output should be "NO".
   - For the input `UU`, the number of 'U' is 2 (even), so the output should be "NO".

The annotated version confirms that the program correctly counts the 'U' characters and checks their parity, aligning with the game dynamics described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
