### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle, where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U").

Here's the breakdown of the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function reads the input from standard input.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `cases`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function takes a single test case `case` as input, which is a tuple `(n, s)`.
   - It counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`.
   - It checks if the count of "U" is odd.
     - If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that Alice wins.
     - If the count is even, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob wins.

### Analysis:

The core logic of the game is encapsulated in the statement that Alice wins if the number of "U" coins is odd, and Bob wins if the number of "U" coins is even. This is because each move reduces the number of "U" coins by one, and the player who faces a situation with zero "U" coins loses.

Given the provided functions:
- `func_1` correctly reads and parses the input into a list of test cases.
- `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins.

Since both functions work as intended and align with the problem's requirements, the overall program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
