The code appends a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, while `cases` now contains one tuple.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100), `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.
