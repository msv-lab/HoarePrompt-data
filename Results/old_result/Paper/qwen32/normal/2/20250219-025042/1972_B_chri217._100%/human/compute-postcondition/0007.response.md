The given code snippet reads a new positive integer `n` from the input, which overwrites the existing value of `n`. The other variables `t`, `s`, and `cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100) minus 1, `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.

In simpler terms, `n` has been updated to a new value read from the input, while `t`, `s`, and `cases` retain their original values.
