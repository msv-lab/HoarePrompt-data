Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `case`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple, `case[0]`, is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second element, `case[1]`, is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin is facing up and "D" indicates a coin is facing down. The function returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' in `case[1]` is odd; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
