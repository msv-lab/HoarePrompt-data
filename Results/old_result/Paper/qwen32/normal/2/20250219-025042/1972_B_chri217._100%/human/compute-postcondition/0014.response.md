Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each representing a pair of `(n, s)` as read from the input during each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it counts down with each iteration. The variables `n` and `s` will hold the most recently read values, but these are not relevant to the final state of the loop since the loop has terminated. The `cases` list will contain all the pairs `(n, s)` that were read during each of the `t` iterations.
