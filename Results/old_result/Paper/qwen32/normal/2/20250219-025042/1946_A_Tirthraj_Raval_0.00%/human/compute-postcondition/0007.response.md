The code snippet `res = a.count(a[p])` counts the occurrences of the element at index `p` in the list `a`. Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, the value of `res` will be the number of times the middle element (or the element just before the middle in case of even length) appears in the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`; `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.**
