Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given code and compare it with the problem requirements. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic needed to solve the problem:

1. **Understanding the Median**: The median of an array is the middle element when the array is sorted. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is defined as the element at the position `ceil(n/2)` in the sorted array.

2. **Increasing the Median**: To increase the median, we need to ensure that the middle element(s) in the sorted array increase. This can be done by increasing some elements in the array.

3. **Minimum Operations**: The minimum number of operations required to increase the median is equal to the number of times the current median appears in the sorted array. This is because we need to ensure that at least one of these middle elements becomes strictly greater than the current median.

Now, let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1  # Index of the median in the sorted array
        res = a.count(a[p])   # Count how many times the median appears
        print(res)
```

- The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
- It sorts the array `a`.
- It calculates the index `p` of the median element in the sorted array.
- It counts how many times the median element appears in the array using `a.count(a[p])`.
- It prints this count as the result.

However, there is a logical error in the code. The number of operations required to increase the median is not simply the count of the median element. Instead, it should be the number of elements that are less than or equal to the median, because we need to ensure that at least one of these elements becomes strictly greater than the current median. The correct approach would involve finding the smallest number of increments needed to make the median strictly larger than its current value.

Given the current implementation, the code does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
