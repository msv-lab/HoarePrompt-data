The given code snippet reassigns the value of `p` using the expression `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. Since `p` was already defined as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` in the initial state, executing this line does not change the value of `p`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, except that the reassignment operation confirms the value of `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\); `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the original list `a`.**
