The given code snippet reassigns the value of `p` using the expression `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. Since `p` was already defined as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` in the initial state, the value of `p` does not change after executing this line. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`; `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.**
