Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` and its logic do not accurately determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`. Here are some key issues:

1. **Logic for Checking Subsequences**: The function `func_1` does not properly check if all possible combinations of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It simply removes characters from a set and appends them to `s1` and `s2`, but this does not ensure that all possible subsequences are checked.

2. **Constructing the Missing String**: The logic for constructing a missing string when the answer is "NO" is flawed. It simply checks for the presence of characters in `s1` and constructs a string based on the first character not found, which does not guarantee that this string is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively, such as when `n` is large relative to `k` or when `s` contains very few characters.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as generating all possible strings of length `n` and checking each one as a subsequence of `s`. Alternatively, a more efficient method might involve dynamic programming or other advanced techniques to avoid generating all possible strings explicitly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def is_subsequence(x, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def generate_all_strings(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        yield ""
        return
    for c in range(k):
        for s in generate_all_strings(n - 1, k):
            yield chr(ord('a') + c) + s

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    all_strings = generate_all_strings(n, k)
    missing_string = None
    for candidate in all_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(candidate, s):
            missing_string = candidate
            break
    if missing_string:
        print("NO")
        print(missing_string)
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This corrected program generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks each one to see if it is a subsequence of `s`. If a missing string is found, it prints "NO" followed by the missing string; otherwise, it prints "YES".
