### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function `func_1` against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
2. If all such strings are subsequences, print "YES".
3. If not, print "NO" and provide one such string that is not a subsequence.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` to collect characters from `s` that are within the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - It also initializes an empty string `s2` and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - As it iterates through `s`, it adds characters to `s1` if they are within the `alphabet`.
   - When `alphabet` becomes empty, it appends the current character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - The function returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)` where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.

#### Issues with `func_1`:
- **Flawed Logic:** The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences in `s`. This condition only checks if there are enough characters from the first `k` alphabets in `s`, but it does not verify the presence of all possible subsequences.
- **Incorrect Output Values:** The returned values `s1[r * k:]` and `s2` do not help in determining the absence of a required subsequence. Specifically, `s2` is just the last character encountered when the alphabet set is emptied, and `s1[r * k:]` is a slice of `s1` starting from a specific index, neither of which helps in identifying a missing subsequence.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- For the second test case:
  - Input: `2 2 3 abb`
  - Expected Output: `NO aa`
  - The current implementation does not correctly identify "aa" as a missing subsequence.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If all are subsequences, print "YES".
4. If not, print "NO" and provide one such string that is not a subsequence.

Given the current implementation does not follow this approach, it is clear that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
