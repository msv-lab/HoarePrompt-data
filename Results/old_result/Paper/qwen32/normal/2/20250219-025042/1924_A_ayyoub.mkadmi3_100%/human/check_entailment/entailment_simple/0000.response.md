### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the alphabet set by removing characters found in `s`.
   - If the alphabet set becomes empty, it resets it and adds the current character to `s2`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences in `s`.
   - The logic for checking subsequences is flawed. It simply checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, which does not guarantee that all possible combinations of length `n` are present as subsequences.
   - The construction of the missing string is also incorrect. It just appends characters that are not in `s1` to `s2`, which does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.

#### Example Analysis:
- For the second test case (`n=2`, `k=2`, `s="abb"`):
  - The function `func_1` will return `False` because `len(s1)` is not at least `2*2=4`.
  - However, the correct missing string should be `"aa"`, but the function might not correctly identify this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem due to flawed logic in checking subsequences and constructing the missing string.

**Correctness: False**
