The code removes the character `i` from the set `alphabet`. The string `s`, the integer `k`, the integer `n`, the length of `s` which is `m`, and the character `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except the character `i`, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
