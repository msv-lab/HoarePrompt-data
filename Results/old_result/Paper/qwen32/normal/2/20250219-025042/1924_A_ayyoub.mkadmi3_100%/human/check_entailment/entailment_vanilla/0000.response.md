Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Overview:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence and adds it to the output list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and removes letters from the alphabet set as they appear in `s`.
   - When the alphabet set becomes empty, it resets it and appends the current character to `s2`.
   - It calculates the ratio `r` of the length of `s1` to `k` and returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. The function does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences.
   - The construction of the missing string when `func_1` returns `False` is incorrect. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and repeats it, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence.
   - The logic to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences is overly simplistic and does not account for the combinatorial nature of the problem.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - This can be computationally expensive, but it is necessary to ensure correctness.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic of `func_1` and the way the missing string is constructed, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
