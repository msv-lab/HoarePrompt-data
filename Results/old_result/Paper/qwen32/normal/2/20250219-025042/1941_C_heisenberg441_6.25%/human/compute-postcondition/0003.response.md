The given code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Additionally, the string `s` is not equal to 'mapie'; `ans` is 0.**
