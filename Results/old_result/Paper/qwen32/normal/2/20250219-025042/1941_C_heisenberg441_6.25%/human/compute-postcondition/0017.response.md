To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop will continue to execute as long as the string `s` contains the substring `'pie'`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` that no longer contains the substring `'map'` and does not contain the substring `'pie'` after the removal.
- `ans` is `k + 1`

The loop condition is `while s.find('pie') != -1:`. For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`.

Since the current state specifies that `s` does not contain the substring `'pie'` after some removal, we need to adjust `s` to include the substring `'pie'`.

Therefore, the state should be modified to ensure that `s` contains the substring `'pie'`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` that contains the substring `'pie'`; `ans` is `k + 1`**
