Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string `s` to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" is a substring of `s`. 

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Handling Special Case**: The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1. This is incorrect because removing one character from "mapie" (e.g., changing it to "mape") still leaves "map" as a substring. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2 (remove 'm' and 'a' or 'p' and 'e' to get rid of both "map" and "pie").

2. **Removing Substrings**:
   - The function uses a `while` loop to find and remove occurrences of "map" by slicing the string and incrementing the counter `ans`.
   - Similarly, another `while` loop removes occurrences of "pie".
   
3. **Counting Removals**:
   - Each time "map" or "pie" is found, the function increments `ans` by 1 and removes two characters from the string.
   - This approach assumes that removing two characters at a time will always result in the minimum number of deletions, which is not necessarily true. For example, in the string "mapie", removing "ma" and "pi" would require 4 deletions, but removing "mp" and "ie" would only require 2 deletions.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program does not consider overlapping substrings or more efficient ways to remove characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" simultaneously.
   - It also does not handle cases where multiple removals can be combined to minimize the total number of deletions.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the following reasons:
- It incorrectly handles the special case of the string "mapie".
- It does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions in general cases.
- It does not account for overlapping substrings or more efficient removal strategies.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
