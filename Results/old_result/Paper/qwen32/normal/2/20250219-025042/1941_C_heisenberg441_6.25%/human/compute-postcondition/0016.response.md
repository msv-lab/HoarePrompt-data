The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` that no longer contains the substring `'map'` and does not contain the substring `'pie'` after the removal; `ans` is `k + 1`.
