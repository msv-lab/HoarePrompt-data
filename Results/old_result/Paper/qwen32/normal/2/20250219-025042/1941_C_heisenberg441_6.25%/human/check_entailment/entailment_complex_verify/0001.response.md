### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful.
- A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "map" or "pie".

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function aims to remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" to make the string beautiful.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
   - It uses two while loops to repeatedly find and remove the first occurrence of "map" and "pie" in the string `s`.
   - Each removal increments the counter `ans` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns `ans`, which is the total number of deletions made.

3. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The function includes a special case for the string "mapie", returning 1. However, this is incorrect because "mapie" requires 2 deletions to become beautiful ("mape" or "mie").

4. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The primary issue is that the function does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions. It simply removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" and continues, which might not be optimal.
   - For example, in the string "mappppie", the function will first remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, an optimal solution would be to remove the "p" in "map" and the "p" in "pie", also resulting in 2 deletions but in a different way. The function's approach does not ensure this optimal solution in all cases.
   - Another issue is that the function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the function will remove "map" first, leaving "pie", and then remove "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing the "p" in "map" and the "p" in "pie" would result in only 2 deletions but in a different way. The function's approach does not ensure this optimal solution in all cases.

5. **Annotated Code Review**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
   - They confirm that the function removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" and counts the deletions.
   - However, they do not address the optimality of the deletions or the correctness of the special case handling.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The special case handling for "mapie" is incorrect, and the greedy approach of removing the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" does not guarantee an optimal solution.

**Final: False**
