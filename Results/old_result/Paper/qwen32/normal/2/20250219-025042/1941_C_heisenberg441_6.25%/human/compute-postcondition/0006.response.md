Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) (but now `s` is shorter by 2 characters); `s` is a string of length `n-2` that originally contained the substring `'map'` which is now modified to `'m'`; `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
