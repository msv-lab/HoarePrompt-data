The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` was 1, so after executing the code, `ans` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n-2` with the first occurrence of the substring `'map'` removed; `ans` is 2**.
