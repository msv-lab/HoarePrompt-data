The code snippet removes the substring `'map'` from the string `s`. Given that `s` originally contains the substring `'map'`, the new value of `s` will be the original string with the first occurrence of `'map'` removed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n-2` with the first occurrence of the substring `'map'` removed; `ans` is 1**.
