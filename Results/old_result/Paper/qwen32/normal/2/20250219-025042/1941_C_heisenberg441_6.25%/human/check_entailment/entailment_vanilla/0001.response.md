Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` (though `n` is not used in the logic) and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.
   - The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1. However, this special case is incorrect because "mapie" should require 2 deletions to become beautiful ("mape" or "mie"), not 1. This special case handling is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map":
     - `s.find('map')` finds the index of the first occurrence of "map".
     - If found, it removes the "ma" part of "map" by slicing the string around the found index.
     - It increments the counter `ans` by 1 for each removal.
   - Similarly, it enters another loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie":
     - `s.find('pie')` finds the index of the first occurrence of "pie".
     - If found, it removes the "pi" part of "pie" by slicing the string around the found index.
     - It increments the counter `ans` by 1 for each removal.
   - Finally, it returns the counter `ans`, which represents the total number of deletions made.

3. **Issues with the Logic**:
   - The special case for "mapie" being handled incorrectly.
   - The main issue is that the function does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions. It simply removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" and continues, which might not be optimal.
   - For example, consider the string "mappppie". The function will first remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, an optimal solution would be to remove the "p" in "map" and the "p" in "pie", resulting in only 2 deletions but in a different way. But the function's approach does not ensure this optimal solution in all cases.
   - Another issue is that the function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the function will remove "map" first, leaving "pie", and then remove "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing the "p" in "map" and the "p" in "pie" would result in only 2 deletions but in a different way. The function's approach does not ensure this optimal solution in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
