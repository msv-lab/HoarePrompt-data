You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:

    #State: `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, determined by the conditions of each test case.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 1, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. The loop has printed each element of `results` exactly once.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` coins in a circle, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
- Alice goes first.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
- Determine if Alice wins if both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
- If `n` is even, the outcome is always "NO".
- If `n` is odd, Alice wins if the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
- For each test case:
  - If `n` is even, it appends "no" to the results.
  - If `n` is odd, it checks if the count of "U" is greater than the count of "D":
    - If true, it appends "yes".
    - Otherwise, it appends "no".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Even `n` Case**: The program correctly returns "NO" if `n` is even.
2. **Odd `n` Case**: The program checks if the count of "U" is greater than the count of "D" and returns "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  UUD
  ```
- Expected Output: "YES" (Alice can win since `n` is odd and there are more "U" than "D").
- Actual Output: "YES" (Correct).

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  UUUU
  ```
- Expected Output: "NO" (Since `n` is even).
- Actual Output: "NO" (Correct).

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  DDD
  ```
- Expected Output: "NO" (Alice cannot win since `n` is odd but there are no "U").
- Actual Output: "NO" (Correct).

#### Test Case 4:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  UDD
  ```
- Expected Output: "NO" (Alice cannot win since `n` is odd but there are equal "U" and "D").
- Actual Output: "NO" (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all the described cases correctly. It correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of `n` and the counts of "U" and "D" when `n` is odd.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It handles both even and odd values of `n` appropriately and correctly determines the winner based on the counts of "U" and "D" when `n` is odd.
