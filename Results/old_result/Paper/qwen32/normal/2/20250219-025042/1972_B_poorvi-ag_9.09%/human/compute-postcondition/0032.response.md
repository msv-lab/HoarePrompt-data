In the given initial state, we know that `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. However, there is no mention of the variable `i` in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` based on the provided information.

Given the code snippet `print(i)`, we need to describe the output in terms of the variable `i` since its value is not explicitly provided.

Since the value of `i` is not specified, the output will depend on whatever value `i` holds at the point of execution. We can only say that `i` is a variable whose value needs to be determined from the context in which this code snippet is placed.

Output: **i (where i is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state)**
