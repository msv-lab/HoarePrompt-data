Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the input string. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the single element `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, or the single element `'no'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the integer value from input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, `i` is 1. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the strings 'no' and 'yes'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the single element `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, or the elements `'no'` and `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the newly input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, `i` is 2. If `n` is even, `results` is `['no', 'yes', 'no']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`, or `['no', 'yes', 'yes']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`. If `n` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'no']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`, or `['yes', 'yes']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
