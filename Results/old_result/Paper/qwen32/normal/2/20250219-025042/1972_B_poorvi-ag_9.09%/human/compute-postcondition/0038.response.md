Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D". The function processes each test case and returns the final depth after processing the string `s` where "U" increases the depth by 1 and "D" decreases the depth by 1.**
