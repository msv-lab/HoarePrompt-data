In this case, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in the list one by one. Since the loop iterates directly over the elements of the list, there is no explicit loop counter like `index` in the previous example.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the second-to-last element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should take the value of the last element in the `results` list.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `results`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second-to-last element of `results`.
3. For the loop to continue, `i` should now be the last element of `results`.

Since the length of `results` is `t` (where `t` is at least 2), and we've already processed up to the second-to-last element, the next (and final) element to be processed is the last element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next (and final) iteration should be:

State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 2, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, `i` is the last element of `results`**
