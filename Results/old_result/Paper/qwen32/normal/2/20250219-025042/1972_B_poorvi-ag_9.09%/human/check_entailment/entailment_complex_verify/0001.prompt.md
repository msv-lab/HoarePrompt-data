You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, determined by the conditions of each test case.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 1, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. The loop has printed each element of `results` exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'U' and 'D'. For each test case, it checks if the length of the string `n` is odd and if the count of 'U' in the string is greater than the count of 'D'. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'no'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each of which can be either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D"). Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Observations

1. **Even Number of Coins**: If the number of coins `n` is even, it can be shown that Bob will always win if both players play optimally. This is because every move by Alice will result in an odd number of coins, and every move by Bob will result in an even number of coins. Eventually, the game will reach a state where Alice faces an even number of coins, and she will be forced into a losing position.
   
2. **Odd Number of Coins**: If the number of coins `n` is odd, the outcome depends on the initial distribution of "U" and "D" coins. Specifically, if the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins, Alice can always force a win. Otherwise, Bob can force a win.

### Provided Solution Analysis

The provided solution checks:
- If the number of coins `n` is even, it appends 'no' to the results (indicating Bob wins).
- If the number of coins `n` is odd, it checks the count of "U" and "D":
  - If the count of "U" is greater than the count of "D", it appends 'yes' (indicating Alice wins).
  - Otherwise, it appends 'no' (indicating Bob wins).

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the solution against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `5`, `UUDUD`
   - Analysis: `n` is odd (5), and the count of "U" (3) is greater than the count of "D" (2).
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Provided Output: `YES`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `5`, `UDDUD`
   - Analysis: `n` is odd (5), but the count of "U" (2) is not greater than the count of "D" (3).
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Provided Output: `NO`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `2`, `UU`
   - Analysis: `n` is even (2).
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Provided Output: `NO`

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic based on the key observations derived from the problem analysis. It handles both even and odd numbers of coins appropriately and checks the counts of "U" and "D" when necessary.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided solution is:
