You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, determined by the conditions of each test case.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 1, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. The loop has printed each element of `results` exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D". The function processes each test case and returns the final depth after processing the string `s` where "U" increases the depth by 1 and "D" decreases the depth by 1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
