Output State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 1, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. The loop has printed each element of `results` exactly once.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop finishes executing all its iterations, it will have printed each element of the `results` list exactly once. The list `results` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, meaning it still contains `t` elements, each of which is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element of `results` after the loop completes.
