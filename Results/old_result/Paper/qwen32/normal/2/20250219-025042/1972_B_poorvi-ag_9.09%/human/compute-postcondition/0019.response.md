The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial contents of `results`, `'no'` will be added to the end of it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `n` is the integer value from input.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D".
- `arr` is the newly input string.
- If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`.
- If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the single element `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, or the single element `'no'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`.
- `i` is 1.

After executing `results.append('no')`, the `results` list will have an additional `'no'` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the integer value from input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, `results` is a list with an additional `'no'` appended to its initial contents, `i` is 1.**
