The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Given the initial conditions, `results` could either be `['no', 'yes']` or `['yes']` depending on whether `n` is even or odd and the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`.

If `n` is even, `results` initially contains `['no', 'yes']`. After appending `'no'`, `results` becomes `['no', 'yes', 'no']`.

If `n` is odd, `results` initially contains either `['yes']` (if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`) or `['no', 'yes']` (if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`). After appending `'no'`, `results` becomes `['yes', 'no']` or `['no', 'yes', 'no']`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the newly input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, `i` is 2, `results` is either `['no', 'yes', 'no']` or `['yes', 'no']` depending on the initial conditions.**
