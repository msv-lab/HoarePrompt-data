In the given task, the for loop iterates over the elements of the list `results`. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of `results`. Specifically, `results` must be a list with at least one element since the loop will iterate over each element in `results`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `results`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `results` must contain at least one element.
3. The state of `results` before the loop starts should be such that it contains at least one element, which is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 1, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**
