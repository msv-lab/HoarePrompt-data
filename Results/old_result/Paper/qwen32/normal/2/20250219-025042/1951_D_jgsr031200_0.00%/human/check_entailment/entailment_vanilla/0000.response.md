Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and returns.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a list `costs` with two values: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall in `costs` and adjusts `n` accordingly.
   - Finally, it checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the prices of the stalls.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Setting Up Stalls:**
   - The logic for setting up stalls is flawed. The code only considers two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is insufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The code does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels by adjusting the prices of up to 60 stalls appropriately.

2. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - The output format is incorrect when printing "YES". The number of stalls should be printed before the prices, but the code prints "YES" before the number of stalls.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where `k` is very large compared to `n` or vice versa effectively.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the prices of up to 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use binary representation or other strategies to distribute the prices effectively.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code is incorrect for solving the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
