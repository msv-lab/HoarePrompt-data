The given code snippet modifies the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it. Given the initial state, we know:

- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `curr` is `n`
- `h` is `h + n`
- `n` is `n - i * curr`
- `i` is `1`

The line `n -= i * curr` translates to `n = n - (i * curr)`. Since `i` is `1` and `curr` is `n`, this simplifies to `n = n - n`, which means `n` becomes `0`.

Therefore, the updated state of `n` is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `curr` is `n`; `h` is `h + n`; `n` is `0`; `i` is `1`**
