You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints "YES" followed by 1 three times if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it calculates a series of values and prints "NO" if a certain condition is not met; otherwise, it prints "2", "YES", and two specific values derived from `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value in any case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is called without being defined within the provided code snippet. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Setting Up Stalls**: The logic used to determine the prices for the stalls is incorrect. The current implementation sets up only two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if the total number of jewels bought equals `k`. This approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, the current logic might not be able to set up the stalls correctly to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Number of Stalls Constraint**: The problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. The current implementation does not ensure that the number of stalls is within this limit.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob needs to strategically set up the prices of the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use a greedy strategy where the prices of the stalls are chosen in a way that maximizes the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall while ensuring she buys exactly `k` jewels in total.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    remaining_coins = n
    
    # Use binary search to find the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall
    for i in range(1, 61):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        
        max_price = remaining_coins // remaining_jewels
        if max_price == 0:
            break
        
        stalls.append(max_price)
        remaining_jewels -= 1
        remaining_coins -= max_price
    
    if remaining_jewels == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of stalls is within the limit and that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It uses a greedy approach to set up the prices of the stalls.
