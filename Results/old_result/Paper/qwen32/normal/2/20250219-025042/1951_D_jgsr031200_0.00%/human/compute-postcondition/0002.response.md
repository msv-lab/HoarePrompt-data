Let's analyze the given task step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet outputs the number `1`. This output is independent of the values of `n` and `k`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but it does not affect the execution of the `print(1)` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will simply output the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
