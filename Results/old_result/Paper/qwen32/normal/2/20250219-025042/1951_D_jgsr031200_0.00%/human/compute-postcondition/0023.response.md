The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n`. Given the initial state, `n` is `0`, `i` is `1`, and `curr` is `0`. Therefore, the operation `i * curr` results in `1 * 0`, which is `0`. Subtracting `0` from `n` does not change the value of `n`.

Thus, the value of `n` remains `0`. The other variables (`costs`, `h`, `curr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `curr` is `0`; `h` is `h + n`; `n` is `0`; `i` is `1`**.
