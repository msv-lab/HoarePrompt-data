Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the conditions 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is currently less than `k`.

However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not involve any calculations or dependencies on the variables `n` and `k`.

Output: **NO**
