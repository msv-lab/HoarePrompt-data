Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `curr` is set to `n`.
- `h` is updated to `h + n`.
- `n` is set to `0`.
- `i` is set to `1`.
- It is also mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables (`costs`, `curr`, `h`, `n`, `i`) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a static string.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable values.

Output: **YES**
