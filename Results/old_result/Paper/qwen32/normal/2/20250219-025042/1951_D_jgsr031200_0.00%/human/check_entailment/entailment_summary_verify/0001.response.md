### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices.
- Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on.
- Bob needs to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
- The price per jewel at each stall must be an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins) and `k` (jewels).

2. **Special Cases Handling:**
   - If `n == k`, the code correctly prints "YES", sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and returns.
   - If `n < k`, the code correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The code initializes a list `costs` with two values: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating the remaining coins `n`.
   - The variable `h` accumulates the total number of jewels Alice buys.
   - If `h < k` after the loop, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the costs.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Simplistic Approach:** Using only two stalls (`costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`) is insufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all scenarios.
- **Lack of General Strategy:** The code does not provide a general strategy to distribute the cost of `k` jewels across at most 60 stalls.
- **Binary Representation Insight:** A better approach would involve using binary representation or other combinatorial methods to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
- One effective strategy is to use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their respective prices.
- For example, if `k` is represented in binary, each bit set to 1 indicates a stall where Alice should buy a certain number of jewels.
- This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 60 stalls.

#### Example Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the code using binary representation:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Convert k to binary and get the positions of bits set to 1
    stalls = []
    remaining_k = k
    power = 0
    while remaining_k > 0:
        if remaining_k & 1:
            stalls.append(2**power)
        remaining_k >>= 1
        power += 1
    
    # Ensure we have at most 60 stalls
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Calculate the prices for each stall
    prices = []
    for stall in stalls:
        price = n // stall
        if price == 0:
            print('NO')
            return
        prices.append(price)
    
    print('YES')
    print(len(prices))
    print(*prices)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly solve the problem due to its overly simplistic approach and lack of a general strategy to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
