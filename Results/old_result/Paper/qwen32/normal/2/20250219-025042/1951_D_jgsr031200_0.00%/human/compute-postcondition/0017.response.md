The given code snippet updates the value of `curr` based on the current value of `n` and `i`. Since `i` is `1`, the new value of `curr` will be `n // 1`, which simplifies to just `n`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `costs` remains `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `curr` is now `n`.
- `h` remains `h + (n // i)`, which was previously calculated.
- `n` remains `n - i * curr`, which was previously calculated.
- `i` remains `1`.

Output State: **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `curr` is `n`; `h` is `h + (n // i)`; `n` is `n - i * curr`; `i` is `1`**.
