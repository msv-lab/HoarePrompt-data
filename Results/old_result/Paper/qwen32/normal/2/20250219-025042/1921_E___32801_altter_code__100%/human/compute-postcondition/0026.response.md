Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`; `n` and `m` are not assigned values; `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` was originally greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` has been decremented by 1, `x1` has been incremented by 1, and `x2` is greater than `x1` with the difference between `x2` and `x1` being odd; `a` is `y2 - 1`. If `y1` was originally less than `y2`, then `y1` remains unchanged, `x1` has been incremented by 1, and `x2` is greater than `x1` with the difference between `x2` and `x1` being odd; `a` is `m - y2`.**
