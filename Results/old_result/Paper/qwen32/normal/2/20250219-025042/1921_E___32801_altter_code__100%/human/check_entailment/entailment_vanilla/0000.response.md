Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Initial Conditions**: Alice starts at `(x_a, y_a)` and Bob at `(x_b, y_b)`. They are guaranteed not to start in the same position.
2. **Moves**:
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on the opponent's chip.
4. **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game is a draw.
5. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1()` which processes the input and determines the winner or if the game is a draw.

#### Key Logic in `func_1()`:
1. **Immediate Draw Check**: If `x2 <= x1`, the game is a draw because Alice cannot move down to reach Bob.
2. **Odd Distance Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0` (odd distance), Alice can potentially win.
   - If `y1 == y2`, Alice wins immediately.
   - Otherwise, Alice attempts to align her chip vertically with Bob's by moving diagonally.
   - After alignment, it checks if Alice can reach Bob's column before Bob can move out of reach.
3. **Even Distance Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` (even distance), Bob can potentially win.
   - If `y1 == y2`, Bob wins immediately.
   - Otherwise, Bob attempts to align his chip vertically with Alice's by moving diagonally.
   - After alignment, it checks if Bob can reach Alice's column before Alice can move out of reach.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Vertical Alignment**:
   - The logic for vertical alignment and subsequent checks is overly complex and incorrect.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that after aligning vertically, it can determine the winner based on simple arithmetic checks.
   
2. **Incorrect Draw Conditions**:
   - The program does not correctly handle scenarios where both players can force a draw by staying out of each other's reach.
   
3. **Lack of Proper Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when Alice or Bob is already in the last or first row respectively.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and incorrect handling of the logic, the provided program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game based on optimal play. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
