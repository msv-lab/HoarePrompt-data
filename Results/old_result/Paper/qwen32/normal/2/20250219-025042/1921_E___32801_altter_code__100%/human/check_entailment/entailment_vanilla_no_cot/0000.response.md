Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all scenarios. There are several issues with the logic and conditions used to determine the winner or if the game will end in a draw. Here are some specific problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**: The program incorrectly handles the movement of chips and the conditions under which a player can win. The logic for checking if a player can win after a move is flawed and does not account for all possible optimal moves.

2. **Inconsistent Win Conditions**: The program checks for win conditions in an inconsistent manner. For example, it checks if `y1 == y2` before and after certain moves without properly considering the implications of those moves.

3. **Incorrect Draw Conditions**: The program does not correctly handle all scenarios where the game should end in a draw. Specifically, it does not account for situations where both players are unable to make any more moves.

4. **Logic Errors in Movement Calculation**: The calculations for the number of moves and the resulting positions of the chips are incorrect. The program uses variables like `a`, `b`, and `t` in ways that do not align with the rules of the game.

5. **Case Sensitivity in Output**: While the problem statement allows for case-insensitive output, the program does not ensure this consistently across all possible outputs.

To fix these issues, a more rigorous analysis of the game mechanics and optimal strategies for both players is required. The program needs to correctly simulate the game and determine the winner or if the game will end in a draw based on the initial positions of the chips and the rules of movement.
