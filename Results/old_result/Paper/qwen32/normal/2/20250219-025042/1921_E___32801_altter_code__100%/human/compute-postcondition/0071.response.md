Given the initial state and the operation `y2 -= a`, we need to adjust the value of `y2` by subtracting `a` from it.

From the initial state:
- `t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`
- `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - 1)`
- `x1` is `x1 + a`
- `y1` is 1
- `y2` is greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is `y1 - 1` which simplifies to `0` because `y1` is `1`
- `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`
- `x2` is `x2 - a` which simplifies to `x2` because `a` is `0`
- `n`, `m`, `y2` are not assigned values (but `y2` is mentioned as being greater than or equal to 1)
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`

Since `a` is `0`, the operation `y2 -= a` does not change the value of `y2`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the explicit confirmation that `y2` has not changed:

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - 1)`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is 1, `y2` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is 0, `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`, `x2` is `x2`, `n`, `m`, `y2` are not assigned values, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
