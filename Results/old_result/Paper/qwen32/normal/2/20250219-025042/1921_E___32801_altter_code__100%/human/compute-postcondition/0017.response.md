Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`; `n` and `m` are not assigned values; if `y2` > `y1`, then `y1` is incremented by 1 and `x2` is greater than `x1 + 1` with the difference between `x2` and `x1 + 1` being even; otherwise, `y1` is decremented by 1, `x1` is incremented by 1, and `x2` is greater than `x1` with the difference between `x2` and `x1` being odd; `y1` is not equal to `y2`.**
