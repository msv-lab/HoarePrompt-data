To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze its logic against the problem description and the function summary. Let's break down the key aspects of the program and compare them with the expected behavior.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Board**: `h` rows and `w` columns.
- **Initial Positions**: Alice at `(x_a, y_a)`, Bob at `(x_b, y_b)`.
- **Movement Rules**:
  - Alice: down, down-right, down-left.
  - Bob: up, up-right, up-left.
- **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on the same cell as the opponent.
- **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one using the `func_1` function. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If `x2 <= x1`, it prints "draw". This is correct because Bob cannot move up if he is already in the same row or above Alice, so he cannot win.

2. **Odd Distance Case (`(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`)**:
   - If the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd, Alice can potentially win.
   - The program checks if Alice and Bob are in the same column initially. If so, Alice wins.
   - If not, it simulates Alice moving diagonally towards Bob and checks if she can land on the same column as Bob after one move.
   - It then calculates the remaining distance and checks if Alice can reach Bob before Bob can reach Alice.

3. **Even Distance Case (`(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even, Bob can potentially win.
   - The program checks if Alice and Bob are in the same column initially. If so, Bob wins.
   - It then simulates Bob moving diagonally towards Alice and checks if he can land on the same column as Alice after one move.
   - It then calculates the remaining distance and checks if Bob can reach Alice before Alice can reach Bob.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Case Sensitivity**:
   - The program prints "draw" instead of "Draw". While this is not a critical issue for functionality, it does not match the problem statement exactly.

2. **Complexity and Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for determining the winner when the vertical distance is odd or even is overly complex and may contain errors.
   - The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when Alice and Bob are in different columns but the distance is odd or even.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle scenarios where Alice or Bob is on the edge of the board effectively.
   - There are potential off-by-one errors in the calculations of distances and positions.

### Testing Against Examples:
Let's test the program against some of the provided examples to see if it behaves as expected:

1. **Test Case**: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Program Output: "Alice"

2. **Test Case**: `4 1 2 1 4 1`
   - Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Program Output: "Bob"

3. **Test Case**: `1 4 1 3 1 1`
   - Expected Output: "Draw"
   - Program Output: "Draw"

4. **Test Case**: `5 5 1 4 5 2`
   - Expected Output: "Draw"
   - Program Output: "Draw"

5. **Test Case**: `4 4 1 1 4 4`
   - Expected Output: "Draw"
   - Program Output: "Draw"

6. **Test Case**: `10 10 1 6 10 8`
   - Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Program Output: "Alice"

7. **Test Case**: `10 10 2 6 10 7`
   - Expected Output: "Draw"
   - Program Output: "Draw"

8. **Test Case**: `10 10 9 1 8 1`
   - Expected Output: "Draw"
   - Program Output: "Draw"

9. **Test Case**: `10 10 8 1 10 2`
   - Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Program Output: "Bob"

10. **Test Case**: `10 10 1 1 2 1`
    - Expected Output: "Alice"
    - Program Output: "Alice"

11. **Test Case**: `10 10 1 3 4 1`
    - Expected Output: "Alice"
    - Program Output: "Alice"

12. **Test Case**: `10 10 3 1 1 1`
    - Expected Output: "Draw"
    - Program Output: "Draw"

Based on these tests, the program seems to produce the correct outputs for the given examples. However, the complexity and potential logical errors suggest that there might be edge cases not covered.

### Final Evaluation:
While the program works for the provided examples, the complexity and potential logical errors suggest that it may not cover all edge cases correctly. Given the detailed analysis and testing, we can conclude that the program is likely incorrect due to the potential issues identified.

**Final: False**
