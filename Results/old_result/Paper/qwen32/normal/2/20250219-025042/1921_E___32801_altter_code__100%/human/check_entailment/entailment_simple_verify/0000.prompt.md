You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not handle all cases correctly, particularly those involving the optimal moves of both players. Let's analyze the code and identify a specific case where the code fails.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The code checks if `x2 <= x1` and prints 'draw' if true. This is correct because if Bob is already below or on the same row as Alice, Bob can never catch up.
   
2. **Odd Difference in Rows**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, the code attempts to move Alice and Bob towards each other. However, the logic here is flawed.
   - It checks if `y1 == y2` and prints 'Alice' if true. This is correct because if Alice can directly move to Bob's position in one move, she wins.
   - The subsequent logic to adjust positions is overly complex and doesn't account for all possible scenarios where Alice could win or lose.

3. **Even Difference in Rows**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, the code again checks if `y1 == y2` and prints 'bob' if true. This is incorrect because if they are in the same column but an even number of rows apart, it doesn't necessarily mean Bob wins. Alice could still force a win or a draw depending on the exact positions and board dimensions.
   - The subsequent logic to adjust positions is similarly flawed.

### Specific Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```
- Alice starts at (1, 1).
- Bob starts at (3, 3).

According to the problem description, this should result in a "Draw" because Alice cannot reach Bob, and Bob cannot reach Alice. However, the code incorrectly prints "bob" for this case.

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- Since `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` (3 - 1 = 2), the code enters the even difference block.
- It checks if `y1 == y2` (1 != 3), so it proceeds to adjust positions.
- The logic to adjust positions is flawed and does not correctly determine the outcome.

Thus, the code does not handle all cases correctly, and the correct answer is **False**.
