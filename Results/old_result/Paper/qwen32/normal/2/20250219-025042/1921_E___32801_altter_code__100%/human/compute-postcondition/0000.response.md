The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. This list is then assigned to the variable `r`. The initial state describes `t` as an integer within a specific range, and subsequent lines contain specific integer values related to coordinates and dimensions. However, the provided code snippet only handles the reading of one line of input.

Given that the initial state specifies multiple lines of input, the provided code snippet would only process the first line of input, which is expected to be the integer `t`. Subsequent lines containing the coordinates and dimensions are not processed by this snippet.

Thus, after executing the code snippet, the variable `r` will contain the list of integers from the first line of input, which is `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`.**
