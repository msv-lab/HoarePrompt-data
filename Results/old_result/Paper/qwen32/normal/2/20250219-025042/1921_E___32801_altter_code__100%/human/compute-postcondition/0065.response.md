Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a` is `m - y1`; `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`; `x2` is `x2 - a`. Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.**
