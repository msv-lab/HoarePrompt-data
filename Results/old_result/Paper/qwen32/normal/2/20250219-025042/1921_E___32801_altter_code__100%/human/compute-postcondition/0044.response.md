Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(1 - y1)` if `y2 <= y1`, otherwise `t` is `abs(m - y1)`. `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(1 - y1)` if `y2 <= y1`, otherwise `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(m - y1)`. `n` and `m` are not assigned values. `y1` remains unchanged. `x1` is `x1 + a` if `y2 > y1`, otherwise `x1` remains unchanged. `x2` is `x2 - a` if `y2 > y1`, otherwise `x2` remains unchanged. `a` is `0` if `y2 <= y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y2`. `b` is an odd positive integer equal to `x2 - x1` before the modification. `x2` is greater than `x1`. `x1` is at least `1`. `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. `y2` is `1` if `y2 <= y1`, otherwise `y2` is `m`. `c` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 <= y1`, otherwise `c` is `m - y1`. Additionally, `b // 2 > a`, `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`, `1 <= y1 <= m`, and `1 <= x1 <= n` hold true.**
