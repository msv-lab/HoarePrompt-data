Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`, `n` and `m` are not assigned values, `y1` remains unchanged from its post-initialization state, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `a` is `m - y2` since `y1` was originally `< y2`, `b` is an odd positive integer equal to `x2 - x1` before the modification, and `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `y2 > y1`.**
