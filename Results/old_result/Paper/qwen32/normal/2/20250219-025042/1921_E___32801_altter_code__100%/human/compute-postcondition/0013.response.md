Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`; `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1` is `y1 + 1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not assigned values; `x2` is greater than `x1 + 1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1 + 1` is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y2` is greater than `y1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `x1` is `x1 + 1`. Consequently, the difference between `x2` and `x1` changes from being odd to even. All other conditions remain unchanged.
