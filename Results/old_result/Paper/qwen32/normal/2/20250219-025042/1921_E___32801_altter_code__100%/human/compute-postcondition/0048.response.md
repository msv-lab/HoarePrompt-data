To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the conditions affecting the variables.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is defined based on the condition `y2 <= y1`:
     - If `y2 <= y1`, then `t = abs(1 - y1)`.
     - Otherwise, `t = abs(m - y1)`.
   - `r` is a list containing the same value as `t`:
     - If `y2 <= y1`, then `r = [abs(1 - y1)]`.
     - Otherwise, `r = [abs(m - y1)]`.
   - `n` and `m` are not assigned specific values.
   - `y1` remains unchanged.
   - `x1` and `x2` are modified based on the condition `y2 > y1`:
     - If `y2 > y1`, then `x1 = x1 + a` and `x2 = x2 - a`.
     - Otherwise, `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged.
   - `a` is defined based on the condition `y2 <= y1`:
     - If `y2 <= y1`, then `a = 0`.
     - Otherwise, `a = m - y2`.
   - `b` is an odd positive integer equal to `x2 - x1` before any modifications.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - `x1` is at least `1`.
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `y2` is set based on the condition `y2 <= y1`:
     - If `y2 <= y1`, then `y2 = 1`.
     - Otherwise, `y2 = m`.
   - `c` is defined based on the condition `y2 <= y1`:
     - If `y2 <= y1`, then `c = y1 - 1`.
     - Otherwise, `c = m - y1`.
   - Additional conditions involving `b`, `a`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `m` are provided but do not directly affect the `print('draw')` statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print('draw')` statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement does not depend on the values of any variables or the results of any calculations. It directly prints the string `'draw'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **draw**
