The code snippet `y1 -= 1` decrements the value of `y1` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `y1` is not assigned a value, we cannot determine its exact numerical value before the operation. However, we know that after the operation, `y1` will be one less than its original value.

Given the conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`
- `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not assigned values (except `y1` which gets decremented)
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`

After executing `y1 -= 1`, the value of `y1` is reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`; `n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not assigned values; `y1` is decreased by 1; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.**
