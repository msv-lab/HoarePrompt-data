Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`; `n` and `m` are not assigned values; `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Since `y1 >= y2`, `y1` has been decremented by 1, `x1` has been incremented by 1, and `x2` is greater than `x1` with the difference between `x2` and `x1` being odd.**
