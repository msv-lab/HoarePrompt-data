In the given task, the for loop iterates `times` number of times. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `times`. Therefore, the state of `times` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0.
2. The current state specifies that `times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, which means `times` is already within a valid range for the loop to execute.

Since `times` is already within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for `times` to ensure the loop executes. However, to adhere to the format and ensure clarity, we can explicitly state that `times` should be greater than 0.

State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `check` is 2147483647**. 

Since only the loop head variables need to be adjusted and `times` is already in a valid state, no further adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.
