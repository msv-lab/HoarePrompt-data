Postcondition: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `check` is 2147483647; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element; `dic` is a dictionary that contains `s` as a key; `ans` is `n`; `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`.**
