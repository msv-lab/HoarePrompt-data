Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `h` is the integer hour part of the new input time, `m` is the integer minute part of the new input time. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.**
