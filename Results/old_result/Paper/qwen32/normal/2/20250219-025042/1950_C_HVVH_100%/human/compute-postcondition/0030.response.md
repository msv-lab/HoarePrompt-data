To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the variables `h` and `m`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440 (this represents the total number of minutes since midnight).
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `n` is greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `h` is the hour part of the new input time.
- `m` is the minute part of the new input time.

### Transformations:
1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - `s` is in the format "hh:mm". We need to split this string to get `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).
   - For example, if `s = "14:30"`, then `h = 14` and `m = 30`.

2. **Adjusting `h` and determining `day`:**
   - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, reduce `h` by 12 and set `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s = "14:30"`:
- `h = 14`
- `m = 30`

Applying the transformations:
- Since `h` is greater than 12, `h` becomes `14 - 12 = 2` and `day` is set to 'PM'.

### Print Statement:
The print statement formats `h` and `m` to ensure they are two digits and appends `day`:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Given our example:
- `h` is 2, so `{h:02d}` results in "02".
- `m` is 30, so `{m:02d}` results in "30".
- `day` is 'PM'.

Thus, the output would be:
Output: **02:30 PM**

### General Description:
The output will always be in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" where:
- `hh` is the adjusted hour in 12-hour format with leading zeros if necessary.
- `mm` is the minutes in two-digit format.
- `AM/PM` indicates whether it is in the morning or afternoon/evening based on the original hour.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h and m are the adjusted hour and minute respectively, and day is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original hour)**
