Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` is less than or equal to 12. If `h` is equal to 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.**
