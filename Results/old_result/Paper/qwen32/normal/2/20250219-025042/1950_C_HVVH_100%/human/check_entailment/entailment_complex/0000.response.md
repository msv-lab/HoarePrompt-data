### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

1. **Initialization**: The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM'. This variable will be used to store whether the converted time is in the AM or PM period.

2. **Reading Input**: The number of test cases `t` is read from the input. For each test case, a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" is read.

3. **Splitting Time**: The string `s` is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`. This converts the hour and minute parts from strings to integers.

4. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it is converted to 12 and marked as 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it is converted to `h - 12` and marked as 'PM'.
   - If the hour `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive, it remains unchanged and is marked as 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is exactly 12, it remains unchanged but is marked as 'PM'.

5. **Printing Output**: The converted time is printed in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that the hour is always displayed with two digits using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.

### Checking the Conversion Logic Against Examples:

- **09:41**: `h=9`, `m=41`. Since `h` is between 1 and 11, it remains `9` and is marked as 'AM'. Output: "09:41 AM"
- **18:06**: `h=18`, `m=6`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `18-12=6` and is marked as 'PM'. Output: "06:06 PM"
- **12:14**: `h=12`, `m=14`. Since `h` is exactly 12, it remains `12` and is marked as 'PM'. Output: "12:14 PM"
- **00:59**: `h=0`, `m=59`. Since `h` is 0, it becomes `12` and is marked as 'AM'. Output: "12:59 AM"
- **00:00**: `h=0`, `m=0`. Since `h` is 0, it becomes `12` and is marked as 'AM'. Output: "12:00 AM"
- **14:34**: `h=14`, `m=34`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `14-12=2` and is marked as 'PM'. Output: "02:34 PM"
- **01:01**: `h=1`, `m=1`. Since `h` is between 1 and 11, it remains `1` and is marked as 'AM'. Output: "01:01 AM"
- **19:07**: `h=19`, `m=7`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `19-12=7` and is marked as 'PM'. Output: "07:07 PM"
- **11:59**: `h=11`, `m=59`. Since `h` is between 1 and 11, it remains `11` and is marked as 'AM'. Output: "11:59 AM"
- **12:00**: `h=12`, `m=0`. Since `h` is exactly 12, it remains `12` and is marked as 'PM'. Output: "12:00 PM"
- **21:37**: `h=21`, `m=37`. Since `h` is greater than 12, it becomes `21-12=9` and is marked as 'PM'. Output: "09:37 PM"

All these examples match the expected output, confirming that the conversion logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation based on the given problem description and examples.
