The given code snippet reads a string input in the format "hh:mm", splits it into two parts (hour and minute), converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `h` and `m`. This affects the values of `h` and `m` but does not affect the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, and `day`) unless further operations are performed on them.

Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the updated values of `h` and `m` will be the integer representations of the hour and minute parts of the input string, respectively. The conditions for setting `day` based on the value of `h` are not executed in this code snippet, so `day` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `h` is the integer hour part of the new input time, `m` is the integer minute part of the new input time, `day` is unchanged.**
