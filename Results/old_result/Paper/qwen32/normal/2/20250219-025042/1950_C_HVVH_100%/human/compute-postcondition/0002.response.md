In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts includes `t`, `s`, `day`, and `n`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `day` is `'AM'`, `n` must be greater than 0**
