Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then the current value of `s` remains unchanged and is not equal to `s2`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `s2`.**
