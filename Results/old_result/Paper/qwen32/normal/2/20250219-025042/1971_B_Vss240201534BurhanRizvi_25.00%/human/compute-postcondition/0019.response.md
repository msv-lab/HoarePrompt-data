The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides details about the variables `t`, `s`, and `s2`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`, the output does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

Output: **Yes**
