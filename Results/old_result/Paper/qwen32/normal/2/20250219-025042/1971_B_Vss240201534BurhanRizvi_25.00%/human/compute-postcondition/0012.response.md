The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `s`, `s2`) are used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

Output: **Yes**
