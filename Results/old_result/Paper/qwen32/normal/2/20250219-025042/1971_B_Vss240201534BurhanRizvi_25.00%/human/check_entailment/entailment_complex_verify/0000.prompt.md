You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is 0, s is the last input string, and s2 is a permutation of the last input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it generates a random permutation `s2`. If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `random.sample` function to shuffle the characters of the string `s`. While this approach might work in many cases, it is not guaranteed to produce a different string `s2` from `s` because `random.sample` can sometimes return the same permutation, especially for strings with repeated characters. 

For example, consider the input string `"aaaaa"`. The `random.sample` function might return `"aaaaa"` again, leading the program to incorrectly conclude that no valid rearrangement exists and output "NO".

To ensure correctness, the program should implement a method that guarantees a different permutation if one exists. One way to do this is to swap two different characters in the string if possible. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s_list = list(s)
        n = len(s_list)
        
        # Try to find two different characters to swap
        swapped = False
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s_list[i] != s_list[i + 1]:
                s_list[i], s_list[i + 1] = s_list[i + 1], s_list[i]
                swapped = True
                break
        
        if swapped:
            print('YES')
            print(''.join(s_list))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version of the program ensures that if a valid rearrangement exists, it will be found by swapping two different characters.
