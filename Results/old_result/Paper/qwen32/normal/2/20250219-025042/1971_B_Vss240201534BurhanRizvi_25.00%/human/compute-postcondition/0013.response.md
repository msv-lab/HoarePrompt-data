Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\).
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.

The task is to determine what will be printed when the `print(s2)` statement is executed.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `s`:**
   - `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10.
   - Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine its specific content.

2. **Variable `s2`:**
   - `s2` is explicitly stated to be a permutation of the string `s`.
   - A permutation means that `s2` contains the same characters as `s` but possibly in a different order.
   - Without knowing the specific content of `s`, we cannot determine the exact sequence of characters in `s2`.

### Conclusion:

The `print(s2)` statement will output a permutation of the string `s`. Since the exact content of `s` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `s`.

Output: **s2 (where s2 is a permutation of the string s)**
