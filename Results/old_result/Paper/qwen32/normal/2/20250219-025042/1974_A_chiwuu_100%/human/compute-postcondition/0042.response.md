The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the value of `b`, which was previously set to the value provided by user input, into an integer. This means that whatever value `b` held (as a string from user input) is now converted to its integer representation.

Given that the initial state includes `a` as an integer, `b` as a value provided by user input, `t` being updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`, and `a`, `b`, and `t1` being recalculated, along with `i` being incremented by 1 and `n` being greater than `i + 1`, the only change made by the code snippet is the conversion of `b` to an integer.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`; `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
