The given code snippet converts the string `a` to an integer. This change affects the type of `a` but does not affect the other variables unless further operations depend on the new type of `a`.

Given the initial conditions and the operation performed, the output state will reflect the change in the type of `a` from a string to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is a string, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `b` is even, `t` is initially set to `b // 2`; otherwise, `t` is initially set to `b // 2 + 1`. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `t`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
