The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` between 0 and 99. Since the provided code only affects `n` and does not modify `t`, `x`, or `y`, these variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is an input integer.**
