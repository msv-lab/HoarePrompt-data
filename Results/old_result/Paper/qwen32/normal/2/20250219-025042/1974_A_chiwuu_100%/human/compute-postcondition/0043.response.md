The code snippet assigns the value of `b` to `t`. This means that `t` now holds whatever value `b` had before the assignment. The values of `a`, `b`, `t1`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged except for `t`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is the integer value provided by the user input (same as `b`); `t1` is updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`; `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
