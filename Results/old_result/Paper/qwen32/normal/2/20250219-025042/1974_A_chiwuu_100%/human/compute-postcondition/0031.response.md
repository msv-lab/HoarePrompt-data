The given code snippet recalculates the value of `t1` using the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description. Since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, this condition remains valid. The even or odd nature of `t` and its subsequent update also remain part of the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `t` was even before the if-else block, `t` is updated to `(previous t) // 2`. If `t` was odd before the if-else block, `t` is updated to `t // 2 + 1`. `b` remains unchanged. `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
