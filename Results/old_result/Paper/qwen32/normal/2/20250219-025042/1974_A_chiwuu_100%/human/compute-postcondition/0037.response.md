Postcondition: **`t` is an integer updated based on its previous value and the condition `t1 >= a`. If `t1 >= a`, `t` is updated to `(previous t) // 2` if it was even, or `t // 2 + 1` if it was odd. If `t1 < a`, `t` is incremented by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) % 15 == 0`, or by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1` otherwise. `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` retain their respective values, with `i` being incremented by 1 and `n` remaining greater than `i + 1`. `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
