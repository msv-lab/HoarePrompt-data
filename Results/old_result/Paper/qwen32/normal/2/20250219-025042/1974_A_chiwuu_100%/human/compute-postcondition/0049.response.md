Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is the integer value provided by the user input.
- `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 (integer division) if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 plus 1.
- `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
t2 = a - t1
```

Impact of the Code:
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

Since `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, we can express `t2` as:
- `t2 = a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

Other variables (`a`, `b`, `t`, `t1`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged except for the introduction of `t2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 (integer division) if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 plus 1; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
