To determine the new state after the given Python code executes, we'll follow the logic described in the initial state and apply the operations specified in the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer (its exact value depends on whether it was even or odd before the if-else block).
  - If `t` was even, it is now `t // 2`.
  - If `t` was odd, it is now `t // 2 + 1`.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer (remains unchanged).
- `i` is an integer incremented by 1.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
t2 = a - t1
```

### Impact Analysis:
- `t2` is newly introduced and is calculated as `a - t1`.
- `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged except for their definitions in terms of previous values.

### Output State Calculation:
- `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

### Final Output State:
Given the above, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (updated based on its previous parity), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**.
