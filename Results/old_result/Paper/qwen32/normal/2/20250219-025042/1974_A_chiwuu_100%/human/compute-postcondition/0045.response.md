The code snippet `t = t // 2 + 1` modifies the value of `t`. Given that `t` was initially the integer value provided by the user input, after executing the code, `t` will be updated to `t // 2 + 1`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `t1`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 plus 1; `t1` is updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`; `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
