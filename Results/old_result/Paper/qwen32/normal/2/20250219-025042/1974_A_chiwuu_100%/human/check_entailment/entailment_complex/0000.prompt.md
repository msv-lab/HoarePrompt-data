Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: - After all `n` iterations, the final value of `t` will be printed for each test case.
    #
    #### Example Calculation:
    #
    #Let's assume the following inputs for a single test case:
    #- `t` (initial) = 5 (from the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases, but here we consider one test case with `x=5` and `y=3`)
    #- `n` = 3 (number of iterations)
    #- Inputs for each iteration:
    #  - Iteration 1: `a = 10`, `b = 6`
    #  - Iteration 2: `a = 20`, `b = 8`
    #  - Iteration 3: `a = 30`, `b = 10`
    #
    ##### Iteration 1:
    #- `a = 10`, `b = 6`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 3 * 15 - 6 * 4 = 45 - 24 = 21`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (21 >= 10), `t` remains 3.
    #
    ##### Iteration 2:
    #- `a = 20`, `b = 8`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 8 // 2 = 4` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 4 * 15 - 8 * 4 = 60 - 32 = 28`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (28 >= 20), `t` remains 4.
    #
    ##### Iteration 3:
    #- `a = 30`, `b = 10`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 10 // 2 = 5` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 5 * 15 - 10 * 4 = 75 - 40 = 35`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (35 >= 30), `t` remains 5.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #After all iterations, the final value of `t` is 5 for this test case.
    #
    #### Generalized Output State:
    #For any given test case with initial `t` (which is the number of test cases), and `n` iterations, the final value of `t` after all iterations will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` provided in each iteration. However, the process described above will always yield the final value of `t` after all iterations.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The final output state after all iterations of the loop is determined by the iterative updates of `t` based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The exact value of `t` will vary depending on the inputs, but the process remains consistent.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a value `t` based on `b` and adjusts `t` if necessary to ensure that `t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. Finally, it prints the calculated value of `t` for each test case.
