The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a` and `b`. Since the input is split into strings, `a` and `b` will be strings representing the two integers.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` must be greater than 0. However, `n` is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet, `a` and `b` will hold the string representations of the two integers read from the input. The values of `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a string representing the first integer from the input, `b` is a string representing the second integer from the input, `n` must be greater than 0.**
