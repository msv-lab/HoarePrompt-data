Let's break down the given initial state and the code step by step to determine the final value of `t` that will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- If `b` is even, `t` is initially set to `b // 2`; otherwise, `t` is initially set to `b // 2 + 1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `t`.
- If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
  - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`.
  - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the initial value of `t`:**
   - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1`.

2. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, proceed to the next steps.

4. **Calculate `t2`:**
   - `t2 = a - t1`.

5. **Update `t` based on `t2`:**
   - If `t2` is divisible by 15, update `t` as follows:
     - `t = t + (a - t1) // 15`.
   - Otherwise, update `t` as follows:
     - `t = t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

### Final Output:
The final value of `t` after these calculations will be printed. Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `t`. However, we can describe the process and the final value of `t` based on the given conditions.

Output: **t (where t is determined by the calculations based on the values of a, b, and n)**
