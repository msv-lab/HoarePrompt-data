To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only assume that `func_1()` could potentially modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables. However, without the function's implementation, we cannot determine its exact effect on `t`.

Given the lack of information about `func_1()`, we can only conclude that `t` might have been altered, or new variables might have been introduced. But since no changes to `t` are explicitly described or implied, and no other variables are mentioned in the initial state, we'll assume `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is 1**.
