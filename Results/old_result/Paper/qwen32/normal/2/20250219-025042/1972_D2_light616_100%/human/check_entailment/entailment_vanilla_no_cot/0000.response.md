Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is intended to handle a single test case, but it incorrectly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the program does not properly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given constraints and does not correctly check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

Here's a brief explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. The outer loop iterates over \(x\) (which should be \(a\)) up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which means it misses many potential values of \(a\) that are greater than \(\sqrt{n}\).
2. The inner loop iterates over \(y\) (which should be \(b\)) with conditions that are not appropriate for the problem. It checks if \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\), which are not necessary conditions for the problem.
3. The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` is too restrictive. The problem does not require \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\); it requires \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\).
4. The increment logic `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect because it assumes that all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the gcd condition also satisfy the multiple condition, which is not true.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) for each pair. Given the constraints, an efficient approach would likely involve some form of precomputation or optimization to avoid a naive \(O(nm)\) solution.
