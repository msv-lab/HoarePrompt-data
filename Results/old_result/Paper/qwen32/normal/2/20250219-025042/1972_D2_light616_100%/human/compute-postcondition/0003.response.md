The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a variable whose value we don't plan to use) and `t`, which represents the number of test cases. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's continuation, we only need to consider `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1 because each iteration of the loop corresponds to processing one test case. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Given that `t` must be at least 1 at the start of the first iteration, after the first iteration, `t` would be 0 if there was only one test case. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must have been greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, and it would now be 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1.

State: **`t` is 1**
