To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

This means that for the loop to execute one more time, both of the following conditions must be true:
1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `y` is 3.
- `n` must be at least \((x + 2) * x\).
- `m` must be at least \((x + 2) * 2\).

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\):
   - Since `y` is 3, this becomes \((x + 3) * x \leq n\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least \((x + 3) * x\).

2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\):
   - This becomes \((x + 3) * 3 \leq m\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least \((x + 3) * 3\).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` as follows:
- `n` must be at least \((x + 3) * x\).
- `m` must be at least \((x + 3) * 3\).

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least \((x + 3) * x\), `m` must be at least \((x + 3) * 3\)**
