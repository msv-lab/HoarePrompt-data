Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least `((x + 1) * x)`, `y` is 2, and `m` must be at least `(x + 1)`. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
