To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `x * x <= n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `x` is increased by 1, we need to ensure that the new value of `x` still satisfies the condition `x * x <= n` for the loop to continue executing.

Let's break this down:

1. Let's denote the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration as `x_prev`.
2. Since `x` is increased by 1, the current value of `x` is `x_prev + 1`.
3. For the loop to continue, `(x_prev + 1) * (x_prev + 1)` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` such that it is at least `(x_prev + 1) * (x_prev + 1)`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x_prev`, we can express the state adjustment in terms of `x`:

State: **`x` is increased by 1 and `n` must be at least `(x * x)`**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time given the updated value of `x`.
