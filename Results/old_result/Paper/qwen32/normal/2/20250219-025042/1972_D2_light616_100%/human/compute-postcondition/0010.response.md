To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2)` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

Let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the loop condition:
- `(x + y) * x = (1 + 2) * 1 = 3`
- `(x + y) * y = (1 + 2) * 2 = 6`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `3 <= n`
2. `6 <= m`

Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, we need to adjust these values to satisfy the conditions above.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 6

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2)` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**
