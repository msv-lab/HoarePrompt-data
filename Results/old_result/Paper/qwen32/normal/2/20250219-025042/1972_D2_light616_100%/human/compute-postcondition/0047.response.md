The code snippet `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 2, so now `y` becomes 3. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, `cnt`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`, `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.**
