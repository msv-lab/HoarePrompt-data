To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `n` must be at least `((x + 1) * x)`.
- `y` is 2.
- `m` must be at least `(x + 1)`.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Since `y` is 2, this becomes `(x + 2) * x <= n`.
   - To ensure this condition holds true for the next iteration, `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`.

2. **Condition 2:** `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - This becomes `(x + 2) * 2 <= m` since `y` is 2.
   - To ensure this condition holds true for the next iteration, `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`.

Therefore, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` based on the new value of `x` (which has already been incremented by 1).

State: **`x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least `(x + 2) * x`, `y` is 2, `m` must be at least `(x + 2) * 2`**
