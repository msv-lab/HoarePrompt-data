The code increments the value of `y` by 1. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. The conditions involving these variables still hold true.

Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`, `m` must be at least `x + 1`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))`.**
