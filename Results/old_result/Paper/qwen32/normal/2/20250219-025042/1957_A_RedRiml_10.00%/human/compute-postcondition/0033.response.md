The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over the list `pl`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the current element being processed from the list `pl`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next element in `pl`.

Given that `pl` contains at least one element and the loop has just finished processing the current `j`, the next `j` should be the subsequent element in `pl`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared (and thus must have at least 1 element), `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3 for some element `j` in `d`, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0. `j` is the next element in `pl` after the previously processed element.** 

To be more specific, if `j` was the k-th element in `pl` during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `j` should be the (k+1)-th element in `pl`. However, without knowing the exact position of `j` in `pl` from the previous iteration, we can only state that `j` is now the next element in the sequence.
