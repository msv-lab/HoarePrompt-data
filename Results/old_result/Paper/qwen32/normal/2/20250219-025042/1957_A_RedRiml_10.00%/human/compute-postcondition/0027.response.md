To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `pl` and `d` based on the elements in the `palka` list.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the `palka` list.
- For each element `i`:
  - If `i` is not already a key in the dictionary `d`, it adds `i` as a key with a value of 1.
  - If `i` is already a key in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1.
  - If `i` is not already in the list `pl`, it appends `i` to `pl`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop has processed all elements in `palka`, the following will be true:
- `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka`, and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.

### Variables Unchanged:
- `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.**

### Human-readable Description:
After the loop finishes executing, `pl` will have all the unique numbers from `palka` listed in the order they were first encountered. The dictionary `d` will show how many times each unique number appears in `palka`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`) will remain the same as they were initially.
