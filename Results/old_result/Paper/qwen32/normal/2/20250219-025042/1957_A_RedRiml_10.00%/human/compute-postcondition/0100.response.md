Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where if `i_current` was not originally a key, it is now added with a value of 1; otherwise, its value is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list that includes `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl`. `shapes` is updated to reflect the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`. `w` is `k-1`. `ln` is an input integer. `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element. `i_current` is included in `pl` if it was not originally there. `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`.**
