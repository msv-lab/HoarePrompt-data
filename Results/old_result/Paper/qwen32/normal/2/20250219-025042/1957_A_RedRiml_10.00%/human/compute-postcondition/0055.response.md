The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `palka`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes.

Given:
- `palka` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the current element being processed in the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on the value of the current element in `palka`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should take on the value of the next element in `palka`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `palka` as `idx`. Since `i` is the current element, `idx` would be the position of `i` in `palka`. At the start of the next iteration, `idx` should be incremented by 1, and `i` should be set to `palka[idx + 1]`.

However, since we don't have the exact index `idx` of `i` in `palka`, we can infer that `i` should simply be the next element in `palka` after the current one.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has been added with the value `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value has been incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the element `i`; `i` is the next element in `palka`**
