The code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The variable `i` is defined as `i_next`, which is the next element in the list `palka` after `i_current`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i_next`, `palka`, or `i_current`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after `i_current`; `d[i]` is `1`**.
