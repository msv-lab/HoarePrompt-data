The code increments the value of `shapes` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 1}`, `pl` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `shapes` is `1`, `w` is `k-1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`. The value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**
