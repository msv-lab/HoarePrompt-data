The code snippet updates the value of `palka` by reading an input string, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. This operation does not affect the other variables (`d`, `pl`, `shapes`, `w`, `ln`) directly.

Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is the total number of elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`, `w` is `k-1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
