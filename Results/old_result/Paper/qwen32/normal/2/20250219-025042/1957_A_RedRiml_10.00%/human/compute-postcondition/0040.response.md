To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
2. `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
3. `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
4. `w` is set to 1.
5. `ln` is an input integer.
6. `palka` is a list of integers read from the input.
7. `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
8. `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.
9. `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

The `print(shapes)` statement will output the value of `shapes`.

To find out what `shapes` is, we need to consider the counts of each unique element in `palka`. Specifically, `shapes` is the count of unique elements that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

Since the exact contents of `palka` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times)**
