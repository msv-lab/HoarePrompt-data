The code snippet provided appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that the list `pl` will now include the element `i` at the end of it. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its existing value incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`; `pl` includes the element `i` appended to it.**
