Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared (and thus must have at least 1 element), `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. `j` is the next element in `pl`.**
