Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{i: 1}`; `i` is a key in `d` such that `d.get(i)` is 1.**

Explanation: The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
