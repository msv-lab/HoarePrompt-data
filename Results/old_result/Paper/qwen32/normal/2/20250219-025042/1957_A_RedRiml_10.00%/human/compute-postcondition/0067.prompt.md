Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has been added with the value `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value has been incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the element `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its existing value incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the element `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or its existing value incremented by 1; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` includes the element `i` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
