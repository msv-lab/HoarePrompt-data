Based on the initial state provided:

- `d` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 1}`.
- `pl` is a list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- `shapes` is an integer with the value `1`.
- `w` is defined as `k-1`, but `k` is not provided, so `w` remains undefined in this context.
- `ln` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- `palka` is a list `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`.

The `print(shapes)` statement will print the value of the variable `shapes`.

Given that `shapes` is explicitly defined as `1` in the initial state, the print statement will output `1`.

Output: **1**
