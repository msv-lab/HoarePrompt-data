Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.** 

Since both the if and else parts do not alter the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or the increment of `i`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
