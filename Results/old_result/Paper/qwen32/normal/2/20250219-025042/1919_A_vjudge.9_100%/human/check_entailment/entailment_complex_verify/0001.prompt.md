You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each of the `t` test cases; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd for each test case; `i` has reached the value of `t`, indicating all iterations have completed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then determines whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd, printing "Bob" if it is even and "Alice" if it is odd.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategy for both players. Let's break down the game mechanics and the conditions under which each player can win.

1. **Initial Setup**: Alice starts with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
3. **Actions**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

### Strategy Analysis:

- **Parity of Coin Difference**: The key insight here is the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - If `|a - b|` is even, it means that the players can always mirror each other's moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob can swap; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This way, the difference in the number of coins remains even throughout the game. Eventually, the game will reach a point where both wallets have the same number of coins, and since they start with an even difference, they will end up with zero coins simultaneously, making Bob the winner because Alice goes last.
  - If `|a - b|` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position. By making the first move, Alice can ensure that the difference in the number of coins becomes even after her move, putting Bob in the position described above. Thus, Alice will be the last one to make a valid move and win the game.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If the difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Correctness: **True**
