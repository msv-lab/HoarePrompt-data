Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Alice'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` (as long as they satisfy the given conditions), the output will always be the string `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
