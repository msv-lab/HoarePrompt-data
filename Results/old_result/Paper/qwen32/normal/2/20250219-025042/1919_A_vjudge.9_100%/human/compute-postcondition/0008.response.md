The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. Since `i` is the loop variable that gets incremented with each iteration, and `t` determines the number of iterations, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's say `i = k`), and since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Given that `t` is the total number of iterations and does not change, it remains the same.

Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
