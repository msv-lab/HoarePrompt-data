### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: Alice starts with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
3. **Moves**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not.
   - After potentially swapping, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. **End Condition**: The player who cannot make a move (because both wallets are empty) loses.

### Key Insight:

- **Parity Analysis**: The crucial observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in the two wallets determines the winner.
- **Even Difference**: If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
- **Odd Difference**: If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

#### Explanation:

- **Even Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`)**:
  - When the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he never faces a losing position. Essentially, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she will eventually be unable to make a move.
  
- **Odd Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`)**:
  - When the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a position where the difference becomes even. This forces Bob into a losing position if both play optimally.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even), so Bob wins.
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd), so Alice wins.
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
  - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even), so Bob wins.
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd), so Alice wins.

These examples align with the logic implemented in the program.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Answer:

Correctness: **True**
