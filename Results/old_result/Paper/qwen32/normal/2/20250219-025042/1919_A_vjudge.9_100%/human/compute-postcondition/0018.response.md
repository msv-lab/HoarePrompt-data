Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each of the `t` test cases; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd for each test case; `i` has reached the value of `t`, indicating all iterations have completed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, we have processed `t` test cases where for each pair of integers `a` and `b`, we determined whether the absolute difference between them is even or odd, printing "Bob" if it's even and "Alice" if it's odd. The loop counter `i` will have reached the value of `t`, signifying that all test cases have been handled.
