The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. This value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
