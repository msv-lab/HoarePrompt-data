Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement outputs the string `'Alice'` directly, the output is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`.

Output: **Alice**
