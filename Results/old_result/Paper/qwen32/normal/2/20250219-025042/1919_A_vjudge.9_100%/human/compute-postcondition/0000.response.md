The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
This means that the value of `t` has been updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the conditions regarding the test cases (a and b) remain unchanged.
