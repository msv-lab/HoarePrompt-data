### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code step-by-step to verify if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Palindrome Array**: We need to find a palindrome array `a` of size `n` such that the sums of all but one of its subarrays match the given sums.
2. **Subarray Sums**: The input provides all but one of the subarray sums of the palindrome array `a`.

#### Provided Code Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the list of subarray sums.
2. **Sorting Subarray Sums**: The subarray sums are sorted to facilitate further processing.
3. **Finding Odd Occurrences**: Function `func_2` is used to filter out the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times. This is crucial because the missing subarray sum will be among these odd occurrences.
4. **Determining Missing Sum**:
   - If the length of the list of odd occurrences (`odds`) is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the code further processes to identify the missing sum.
     - It separates the odd occurrences into `oddvals` and `evenvals`.
     - The missing sum is identified based on the presence of single elements in either `oddvals` or `evenvals`.
     - If no such single elements exist, it constructs a temporary array `b` using the remaining odd occurrences and calculates its subarray sums. The missing sum is then calculated using the difference between the sums.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a smaller temporary array `b` and uses similar logic to determine the missing sum.
5. **Constructing the Palindrome Array**: After determining the missing sum, it is added back to the list of odd occurrences, which is then processed by `func_3` to construct the palindrome array `a`.
6. **Output**: The constructed palindrome array `a` is printed for each test case.

#### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Palindrome Construction**: The function `func_3` correctly constructs a palindrome array based on the provided odd occurrences of subarray sums.
- **Missing Sum Identification**: The logic for identifying the missing sum appears robust, considering the constraints and the nature of palindromes.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The code handles different scenarios based on the number of odd occurrences, ensuring that the missing sum is correctly identified.

Given the above analysis, the provided code seems to correctly solve the problem as per the given requirements and constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
