### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how the program reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the provided subarray sums. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Sorting Subarray Sums**: The program starts by sorting the list of subarray sums. This helps in identifying patterns and missing sums more easily.

2. **Identifying Odd Occurrences**: The function `func_2` removes consecutive duplicates from the sorted list of subarray sums. This step is crucial because the sums of subarrays in a palindrome have specific properties, especially when considering the symmetry and overlap of subarrays.

3. **Determining the Missing Sum**:
   - If the length of the list of odd occurrences (`odds`) is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program further categorizes these into odd and even values. It then determines the missing sum based on the presence of both odd and even values.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a smaller list `b` using `func_3` and calculates the missing sum using the differences between the sums of subarrays.

4. **Reconstructing the Palindrome Array**:
   - After determining the missing sum, it is appended back to the list of odd occurrences.
   - The list is then sorted again, and `func_2` is applied to remove consecutive duplicates.
   - Finally, `func_3` is used to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the remaining sums.

5. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1` generates all subarray sums of a given array.
   - `func_3` reconstructs the array from the odd-indexed subarray sums.
   - `func_4` finds the last differing element between two lists of sums.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting and Removing Duplicates**: The sorting and removal of consecutive duplicates help in isolating the unique sums, which is essential for identifying the missing sum.
- **Determining the Missing Sum**: The logic for determining the missing sum seems sound, especially given the constraints and the nature of palindromes.
- **Reconstruction**: The reconstruction process using `func_3` appears to correctly handle the symmetry of the palindrome array.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to reconstruct the palindrome array from the given subarray sums. The helper functions also appear to perform their intended tasks accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
