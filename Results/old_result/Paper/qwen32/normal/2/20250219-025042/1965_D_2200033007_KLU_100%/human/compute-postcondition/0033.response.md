The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `len(a)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- `a` is a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `sm` is `sm + a[3]`.
- `cts` has an additional element which is the value of `sm`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 3. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 4.

The length of the list `a` remains unchanged, so `len(a)` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is `sm + a[3]`, `cts` has an additional element which is the value of `sm`**. 

Note: The values of `sm` and `cts` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head variables. However, they are included in the state description as per the given information.
