To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how it reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums. Let's break down the logic of the functions step-by-step.

### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted. It iterates through each starting point `i` and calculates the cumulative sum up to each endpoint `j`, appending each sum to the list `cts`.

### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
This function processes the list of subarray sums `cts` to identify the unique subarray sums. It uses a stack-like approach where if the current sum is the same as the last element in the `odds` list, it pops the last element; otherwise, it appends the current sum. This effectively removes pairs of identical sums, leaving only the unique sums.

### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums `odds`. It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros. It then iterates through the `odds` list, filling in the values of `a` based on the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. The key here is that since `a` is a palindrome, the values at symmetric positions are equal. The function handles the middle element separately if `n` is odd.

### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`). It removes common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing sum.

### Overall Process
1. **Generate All Subarray Sums**: `func_1(a)` generates all subarray sums of the unknown palindrome `a`.
2. **Identify Unique Sums**: `func_2(cts)` identifies the unique subarray sums.
3. **Reconstruct the Palindrome**: `func_3(odds, n)` reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
4. **Find Missing Sum**: `func_4(bigList, smallList)` finds the missing subarray sum, although this step is not directly used in the reconstruction process.

### Analysis
The core of the solution lies in correctly identifying the unique subarray sums and using them to reconstruct the palindrome array. The provided functions seem to handle these tasks correctly, assuming the input constraints and guarantees are met.

- **Generating Subarray Sums**: `func_1` correctly generates all subarray sums.
- **Identifying Unique Sums**: `func_2` correctly identifies the unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
- **Reconstructing the Palindrome**: `func_3` correctly reconstructs the palindrome array by leveraging the properties of palindromes and the differences between consecutive unique sums.

Given that the problem guarantees there is always at least one valid solution and the constraints are respected, the provided program should correctly reconstruct the palindrome array for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the steps necessary to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
