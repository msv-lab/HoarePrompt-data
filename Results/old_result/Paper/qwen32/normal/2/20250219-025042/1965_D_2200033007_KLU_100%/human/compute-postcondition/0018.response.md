Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `n` is an integer representing the size of the palindrome array `a`, where `n` is an odd integer and 3 <= n <= 1000. `a` is a list of `n` zeros except `a[(n - 1) // 2]` which is `x`. If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[(n - 1) // 2 - 1]` is `x`. Otherwise, `a[(n - 1) // 2 - 1]` and `a[(n - 1) // 2 + 1]` are `0`. `prev` is `x`, and `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `idx` has been decremented by 1, making it `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
