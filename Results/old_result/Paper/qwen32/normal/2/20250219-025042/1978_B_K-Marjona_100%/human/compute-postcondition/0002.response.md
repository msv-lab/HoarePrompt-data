The code calculates the minimum value between `n` and the difference `b - a`, and assigns this value to `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input, the only change is the assignment of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**
