To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't intend to use. The loop will iterate based on the value obtained from `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\).

Since the loop iterates based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is such that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if the input value (which is `t` in this context) is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value (which is `t`) is at least 1. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, as required.
