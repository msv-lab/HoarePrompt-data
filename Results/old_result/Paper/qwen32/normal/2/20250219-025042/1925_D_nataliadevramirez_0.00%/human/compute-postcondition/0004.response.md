To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we can only assume that it processes the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` and returns some result.

Given that the function call `result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` is made, we know that the variable `result` will be assigned whatever value `func_1` returns. However, without knowing the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `t`) remain unchanged unless they are modified within `func_1`. Since there is no indication that `func_1` modifies these variables, we assume they retain their original values.

Therefore, the output state includes the returned value of `func_1` assigned to `result`, while the other variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.
