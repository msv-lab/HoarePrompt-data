### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `friendships`: A list of `m` tuples, each containing two children indices and their initial friendship value.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in lowest terms.

3. **Logic:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected contribution to the sum over `k` excursions is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value.
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) / 2`.
   - The expected value for a single pair is `f * (k * (k + 1) / 2)`.
   - Since the choices are independent and equiprobable, the overall expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs of friends.
   - Finally, we need to compute this sum modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as inputs.
  - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of that friendship to the total expected value using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) / 2)`.
  - It sums up these contributions and returns the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
  - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for the current test case and prints it.

#### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the expected value calculation for each pair of friends.
- The summation and modulo operation ensure that the result fits within the required constraints.
- The main function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It accurately calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions and outputs the result in the required format.

**Correctness: True**
