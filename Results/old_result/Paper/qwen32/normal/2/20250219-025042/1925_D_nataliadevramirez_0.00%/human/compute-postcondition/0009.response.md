To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot compute the exact value of `result`. However, we can state that `result` will hold whatever value is returned by `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.

Given that no other variables are modified by the provided code snippet, the only change is the assignment of the return value of `func_1` to `result`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `t` retain their initial values, and `result` is now the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as arguments.
