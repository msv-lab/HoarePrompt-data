### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f`.
- For each excursion, a pair is chosen uniformly at random.
- If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
- We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions and output it as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in simplest form.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the contribution of each friendship by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`). This approach is incorrect because:
1. **Incorrect Probability Calculation**: The probability of choosing a specific pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. Over `k` excursions, the expected number of times a pair is chosen is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
2. **Incorrect Contribution Calculation**: The contribution of a friendship `(a, b)` with initial value `f` should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`. The provided program instead uses `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, which is incorrect.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program calculates the cumulative sum of `(f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)) % MOD` for all tuples in `friendships`. However, this calculation does not reflect the expected value correctly.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program:
- The probability of choosing a specific pair is not considered.
- The contribution of each friendship is incorrectly calculated.
- The modulo operation is applied after the multiplication, which can lead to overflow issues.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values correctly. Therefore, we need to overturn the original assessment and conclude that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
