The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1**.

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided in the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
