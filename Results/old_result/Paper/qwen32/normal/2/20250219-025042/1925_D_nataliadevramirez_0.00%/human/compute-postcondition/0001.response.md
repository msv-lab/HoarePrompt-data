In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1**
