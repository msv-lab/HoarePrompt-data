Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`, `i` remains `n-3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr`, `i`, `nums`, or `ans`.**
