The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. This means that the previous definition of `arr` as a list of integers potentially modified based on the loop's condition checks is replaced by the new list of integers read from the input.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `ans` is either True if no unsorted `nums` was found, or False if an unsorted `nums` was found and caused the loop to break.**
