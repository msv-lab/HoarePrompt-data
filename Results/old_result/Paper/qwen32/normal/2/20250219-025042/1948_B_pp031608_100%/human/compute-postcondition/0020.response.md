Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is set to the first digit of the concatenated number formed by `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, and `ans` is set to False if the concatenated number is not sorted. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, then `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged, and `i` is decreased by 1.**
