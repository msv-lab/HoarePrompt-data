The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration. Given that `i` is currently `2` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop will execute one more time with `i` being `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop condition is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by `1` to become `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` as `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `arr[i]` remains unchanged, where `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (before reassignment) followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `i` is 1**
