### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array from right to left and checking if the current element is less than the previous one. If it finds such a pair, it tries to split the larger element into its constituent digits and checks if the resulting sequence (digits of the larger element followed by the smaller element) can be sorted. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem requirements.

Here are some key issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program only considers splitting the larger element when it encounters an inversion (i.e., `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`). However, the problem allows splitting any element that is at least 10, not just the larger element in an inversion.
2. **Insufficient Checks**: The program checks if the sequence formed by the digits of the larger element followed by the smaller element can be sorted. This is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be sorted after performing the allowed operations.
3. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by only considering local inversions and their immediate solutions, which may not lead to a globally sorted array.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
