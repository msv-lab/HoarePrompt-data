The given code snippet modifies the `nums` list by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into its individual digits and appending `arr[i]` to this list. This operation only occurs when `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, `nums`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `i` is decreased by 1.

Given the initial state, the code will update `nums` as described. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `arr` may be modified depending on the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
- `nums` is now a list consisting of the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
- `ans` remains either True or False.
- `i` remains unchanged if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`; otherwise, it is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is modified if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is either True or False, `i` is decreased by 1 if `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`.**
