Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `arr[i]` remains unchanged, where `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (before reassignment) followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `i` is 2.**
