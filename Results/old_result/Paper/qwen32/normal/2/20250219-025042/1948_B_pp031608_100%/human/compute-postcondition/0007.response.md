The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by concatenating two parts: the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` (converted to a list of integers) and the integer `arr[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `arr[i - 1]` is an integer, and `arr[i]` is also an integer. The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are extracted by converting `arr[i - 1]` to a string, iterating over each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and collecting these integers into a list. This list is then concatenated with the list containing just `arr[i]`.

Thus, `nums` will be a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True, and `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
