The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be modified by replacing each pair of adjacent elements (from right to left) with a new element formed by concatenating the digits of the larger element followed by the smaller element, such that the resulting list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It outputs 'YES' if such modifications can result in a sorted list, otherwise 'NO'.
