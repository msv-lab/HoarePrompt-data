Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `flag` is `0` and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and both are `'1'`, then `s[i]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to `1`. Otherwise, if `flag` is `True` and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[i]` is set to `'1'` and `flag` is set to `0`. Otherwise, `flag` retains its original value and `s[i]` remains unchanged.**
