Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with the first 29 elements each either the string `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If `s[3] == '-1'` and `s[4] == '1'`, then `s[3]` is updated to `'-1'` and `s[4]` is updated to `'0'`. `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`; `i` is 4.**
