Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 28. If `flag` was 1 and `s[28]` was `'0'`, then `s[28]` is now `'1'` and `flag` is now 0. Otherwise, `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.**
