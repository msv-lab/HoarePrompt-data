Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is 0. If `flag` is non-zero and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[i]` is changed to `'1'`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s[i]`.**
