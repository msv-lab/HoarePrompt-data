Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set or not. If `flag` is 1, the `i`-th element of `s` is now `'0'`, `flag` remains 1, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `flag` is 0, `s` retains its original values, `flag` remains 0, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an input integer. Additionally, either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not `'1'`.**
