You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find an array `a` of integers where each element is either 1, 0, or -1, such that:
1. The sum of `a_i * 2^i` equals the given integer `x`.
2. No two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It initializes an empty list `s` and iterates over the first 30 bits of `x`.
   - If the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting for Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - A flag `flag` is used to track whether the previous element was non-zero.
   - It iterates through the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero:
     - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it sets the current element to `'1'` and resets `flag`.
     - If `flag` is not set and the current and next elements are both `'1'`, it sets the current element to `'-1'` and sets `flag`.
     - If `flag` is set, it sets the current element to `'0'`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After the loop, if `flag` is set and the last element is `'0'`, it sets the last element to `'1'`.
   - If `flag` is still set after checking the last element, it sets the last element to `'0'` and appends `'1'` to `s`, increasing the length.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - It iterates through the list again to ensure no two consecutive elements are `-1` followed by `1`. If such a pair is found, it swaps them.

6. **Output:**
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Binary Conversion:** The initial binary conversion step is correct, but the subsequent adjustments do not guarantee the constraints are met.
- **Flag Usage:** The flag logic is overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.
- **Appending Elements:** The program might incorrectly append elements without ensuring the resulting array meets the problem's requirements.
- **Final Adjustment:** The final adjustment step might not be sufficient to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that the resulting array will always meet the problem's constraints, especially regarding the condition that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
