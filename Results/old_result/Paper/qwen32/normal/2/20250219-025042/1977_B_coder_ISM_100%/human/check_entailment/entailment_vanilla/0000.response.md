Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find an array `a` of integers where each element is either 1, 0, or -1, such that:
1. The sum of `a_i * 2^i` equals the given integer `x`.
2. No two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It initializes an empty list `s` and iterates over the first 30 bits of `x`.
   - If the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting for Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - A flag `flag` is used to track whether the previous element was non-zero.
   - It iterates through the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero:
     - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it sets the current element to `'1'` and resets `flag`.
     - If `flag` is not set and the current and next elements are both `'1'`, it sets the current element to `'-1'` and sets `flag`.
     - If `flag` is set, it sets the current element to `'0'`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After the loop, if `flag` is set and the last element is `'0'`, it sets the last element to `'1'`.
   - If `flag` is still set after checking the last element, it sets the last element to `'0'` and appends `'1'` to `s`, increasing the length.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - It iterates through the list again to ensure no two consecutive elements are `-1` followed by `1`. If such a pair is found, it swaps them.

6. **Output:**
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Binary Conversion:** The initial binary conversion step is correct, but the subsequent adjustments do not guarantee the constraints are met.
- **Flag Usage:** The flag logic is overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.
- **Appending Elements:** The program might incorrectly append elements without ensuring the resulting array meets the problem's requirements.
- **Final Adjustment:** The final adjustment step might not be sufficient to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that the resulting array will always meet the problem's constraints, especially regarding the condition that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
