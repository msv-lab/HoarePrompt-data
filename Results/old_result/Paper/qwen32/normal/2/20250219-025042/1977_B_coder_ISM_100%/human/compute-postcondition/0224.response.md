The code appends '1' to the list `s`. Given the initial state, `s` will still have at most one '-1', with the rest of the elements being either '0' or '1'. The variable `flag` remains unchanged and is still not 0. The element `s[29]` was '0' before the append operation, and this remains true until the new element is added at the end of the list.

After appending '1', the last element of `s` is now '1', and the length of the list `s` increases by 1. The position of `s[29]` remains '0' because the new element is added at the end of the list.

Output State: **The list `s` will have at most one '-1', with the rest of the elements being either '0' or '1', and the last element of `s` is '1'. The variable `flag` is not 0. The element `s[29]` is '0'.**
