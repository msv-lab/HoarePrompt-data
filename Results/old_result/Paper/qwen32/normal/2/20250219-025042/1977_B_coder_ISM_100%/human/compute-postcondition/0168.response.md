Postcondition: **The list `s` is now an empty list `[]`; `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is an input integer; the length of the list remains unchanged unless the initial condition involving `flag` and `s[29]` modifies it; `length` is 30; and `(x & pow(2, i))` evaluates to True.**
