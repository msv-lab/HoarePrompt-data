The code appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`); `index` is 9; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 (and `t` must be greater than 0); `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, and now includes an additional `'YES'`; `n` is `int(data[7])`; `s` is `data[8]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `data[8]`.**
