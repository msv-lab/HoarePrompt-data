The given Python code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the initial state remains largely unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `results`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t`, followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `results` is an empty list.**
