You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be 0). `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, and now includes an additional `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or an additional `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: All elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their states (up or down). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd and outputs 'YES' if it is, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` coins in a circle, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Determine if Alice (who starts first) wins if both play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
- The outcome depends on the initial number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins`).
- If `num_up_coins` is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U' in the string `s`, and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.

### Code Review:
```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Verification:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting 'U' Coins**: It accurately counts the number of 'U' in the string `s`.
3. **Decision Making**: The decision to append 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list is based on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even, which aligns with the problem's logic.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Single Coin**: If `n = 1`, the result depends solely on whether the coin is 'U' or 'D'.
- **All Coins Same**: If all coins are 'U' or all are 'D', the result is correctly determined.
- **Mixed Coins**: The program handles mixed configurations correctly by counting 'U'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It considers all possible configurations of coins and makes the correct decision based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins for all possible configurations, including edge cases.
