Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is 2; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be greater than 0); `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
