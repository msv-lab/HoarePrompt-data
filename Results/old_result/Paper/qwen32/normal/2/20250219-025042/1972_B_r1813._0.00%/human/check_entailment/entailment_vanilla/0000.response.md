### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the conditions under which Alice or Bob will win when both players play optimally. The key insight here is to count the number of facing-up ('U') coins at the beginning of the game.

1. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player removes a facing-up coin and flips its two adjacent coins.
   - If there are only two coins left, removing one leaves the other unaffected.
   - If there is only one coin left, no flips occur.
   - If there are no facing-up coins, the current player loses.

2. **Winning Strategy:**
   - The game can be analyzed by considering the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of facing-up coins, and eventually, Bob will face a situation with no facing-up coins left.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice faces an even number of facing-up coins and ultimately losing the game.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The provided code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
   - It checks if this count is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating Alice's victory.
   - If the count is even, it appends 'NO', indicating Bob's victory.
   - Finally, it prints all results.

Given the above analysis, the logic implemented in the code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it accurately implements the strategy based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

**Correctness:** **True**
