### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program against the problem requirements:

1. **Case when `n < k`:**
   - According to the problem, if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy (`n < k`), it's impossible for her to buy `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

2. **Case when `n == k`:**
   - If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants to buy (`n == k`), she can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with the price of `n` coins per jewel. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by `1` as the number of stalls, and `n` as the price per jewel.

3. **Case when `n > k`:**
   - Here, the program checks whether `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition seems to be an attempt to determine if it's feasible to create a scenario where Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the logic used here is flawed. Specifically, the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` does not accurately reflect the requirement to distribute the purchase of `k` jewels across at most 60 stalls.
   
   - For example, consider the test case `n=255` and `k=8`. The correct output should be "YES" with a suitable distribution of prices across stalls, such as `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`. However, the program would evaluate `k - 1 < n - k + 1` as `7 < 248`, which is true, and then proceed to print "YES" with only two stalls, which is incorrect.

   - Another issue arises when `n > k` but the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is false. In such cases, the program incorrectly prints "NO". For instance, for `n=6` and `k=4`, the correct output should be "YES" with a suitable distribution of prices, such as `2, 1, 1`, but the program evaluates `k - 1 < n - k + 1` as `3 < 3`, which is false, and thus prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when `n > k`. It fails to provide a valid distribution of prices across stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

**Correctness: False**
