The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k` in terms of their values affecting the output. The `print` statement is static and will always output the same string regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ \(10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is less than `k`.

However, none of these conditions influence the `print` statement. The statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **NO**
