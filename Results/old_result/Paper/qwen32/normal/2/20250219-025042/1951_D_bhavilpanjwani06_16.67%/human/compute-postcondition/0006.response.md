Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1` to the console. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k` because it explicitly specifies the value to be printed.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output the integer `1`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
