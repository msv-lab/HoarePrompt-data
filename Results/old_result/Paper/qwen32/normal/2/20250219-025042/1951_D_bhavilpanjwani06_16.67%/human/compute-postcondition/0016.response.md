Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ \(10^{18}\) and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
