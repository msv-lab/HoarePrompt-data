Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` have specific constraints and relationships, but these do not influence the execution of the `print('NO')` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Let's break down the reasoning:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `n` and `k` are integers with `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and they are not equal.
- `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, which simplifies to `k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1` or `2k ≥ n + 2` or `k ≥ (n + 2) / 2`.

Despite these conditions, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` and simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
