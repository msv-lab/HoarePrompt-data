The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500

After executing the code, the value of `n` will change to whatever integer is provided by the input. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged. However, the length of the list `x` should logically match the new value of `n-1`.

Since the exact input value for `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the new specific value of `n`. But we know it will be an integer read from the input, and the precondition for `x` needs to be adjusted accordingly to reflect the new length of `n-1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.**
