Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so its new range is from 0 to 10,000 minus 1. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
