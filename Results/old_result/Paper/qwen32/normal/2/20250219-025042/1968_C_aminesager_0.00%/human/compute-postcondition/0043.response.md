To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the iterations as it is the upper bound of the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1]]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user; `i` is 3**
