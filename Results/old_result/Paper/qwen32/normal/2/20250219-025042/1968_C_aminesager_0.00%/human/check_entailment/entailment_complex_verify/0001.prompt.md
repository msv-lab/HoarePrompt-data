You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[(1000 - sum(T[:n-1])), ..., (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user; `i` is `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It then computes a list `a` of `n` integers based on the input list and prints this list as a space-separated string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that:
1. Each element `a_i` of the array `a` must satisfy `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
2. The array `a` must also satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_(i-1)` for all `2 <= i <= n`, where `x` is the input array of length `n-1`.

### Provided Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `T` of length `n-1`.

2. **Generating Array `a`:**
   - It initializes the array `a` with a single element `1000`.
   - Then, it iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) and appends to `a` the value `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.

3. **Reversing the Array:**
   - After generating the array `a`, it reverses the array.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the array `a` as a space-separated string.

#### Issues in the Program

- **Initial Value of `a[0]`:** The initial value of `a[0]` is set to `1000`. This is arbitrary and does not guarantee that the subsequent elements will satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_(i-1)`.
- **Calculation of Subsequent Elements:** The program calculates the next element in `a` as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`. This approach does not guarantee that `a[i] % a[i-1]` will equal `T[i-1]` because subtraction does not inherently produce a modulus relationship.
- **Reversing the Array:** Reversing the array at the end does not address the core issue of ensuring the modulus condition is met.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the required conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
