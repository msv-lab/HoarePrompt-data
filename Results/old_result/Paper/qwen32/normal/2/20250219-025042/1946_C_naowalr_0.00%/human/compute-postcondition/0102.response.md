The code appends `b` to the list at index `a` in the adjacency list `adj`. This means the list at index `a` now includes `b` in addition to whatever elements it previously contained.

Other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `L`, `R`, `x`, `leftover`, `z`, `i`) remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are also not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**
