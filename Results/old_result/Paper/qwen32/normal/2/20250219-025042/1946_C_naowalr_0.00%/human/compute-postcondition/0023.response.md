To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `dfs(1, 1)`. However, since the function `dfs` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot execute it or determine its exact effect on the variables. Assuming `dfs` is a depth-first search function that modifies `numCuts` or other variables, we'll consider the general impact of calling such a function.

Given the initial state, let's assume that `dfs(1, 1)` does not modify `adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `L`, `R`, or `x`. The only variable that could be modified is `numCuts`.

Let's assume `dfs(1, 1)` returns a value and assigns it to `leftover`. Since the function is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `leftover`, but we can infer that `numCuts` might be updated within the function.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `dfs(1, 1)` increments `numCuts` by 1 and returns a value (let's say 0 for simplicity).

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 1; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is 0.**

This means that after executing the code, `numCuts` has been incremented by 1, and `leftover` has been assigned the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
