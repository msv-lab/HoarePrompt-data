Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is the introduction of the variable `R`, which is assigned the value `100001`. All other variables retain their initial values.
