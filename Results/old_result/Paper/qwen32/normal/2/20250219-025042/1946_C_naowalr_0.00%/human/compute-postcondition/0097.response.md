The given Python code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any other variables listed in the initial state except for `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` now also includes `a`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `n-2`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers read from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
