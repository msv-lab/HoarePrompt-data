Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `adj`, which is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, and `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n. The function returns the resulting structure or properties of the tree after removing `k` edges.**
