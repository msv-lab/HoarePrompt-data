The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Since `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, after the assignment, `L` will take on the value of `x`.

Given that `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, the new value of `L` will be `(L + R) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is `(L + R) // 2`; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0.**
