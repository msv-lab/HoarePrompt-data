Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `x` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`; `R` is either 50002 or `(L + 50002) // 2`; `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `R` is set to `(L + 50002) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` remains 50002.**
