You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings where each string s consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total sum of the lengths of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. The variable `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: s is a list of all '0's followed by all '1's, left is the number of '0's, right is len(s), cost is the total number of swaps performed.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps performed, which is stored in the variable `cost`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a list of strings where each string consists only of '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5. The total sum of the lengths of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns the total number of swaps needed to make all strings in `sChar` alternating (i.e., no two adjacent characters are the same).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of swaps performed, which is stored in the variable `cost`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
