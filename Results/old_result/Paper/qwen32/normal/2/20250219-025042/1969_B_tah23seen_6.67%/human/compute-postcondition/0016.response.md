To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 1.
- If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `right < len(s)`**:
   - `right` is initialized to 1.
   - `len(s)` is at least 2 (since each string in `sChar` has a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5).
   - Therefore, `right < len(s)` is initially true because 1 < len(s).

2. **Condition `s[right] != '0'`**:
   - `right` is 1, so we need to ensure that `s[1]` is not '0'.
   - To guarantee that the loop executes, we need to set `s[1]` to '1'.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `s[1]` is '1'. This will make sure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`; `left` is 0; `right` is 1; `s[1]` is '1'; if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.**
