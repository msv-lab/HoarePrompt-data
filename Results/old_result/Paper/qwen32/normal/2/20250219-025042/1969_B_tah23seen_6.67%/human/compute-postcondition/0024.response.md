Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `left` is 1; `right` is len(s); `s[1]` is '1'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `left` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
