To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as all three conditions are true:
1. `left <= right`
2. `right < len(s)`
3. `left < len(s)`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'.
- `left` is 2.
- `right` is len(s).

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `left <= right`: Since `left` is 2 and `right` is `len(s)`, this condition is true as long as `len(s)` is at least 2.
2. `right < len(s)`: This condition is always false because `right` is defined as `len(s)`. Therefore, to satisfy this condition, we need to adjust `right` to be less than `len(s)`.
3. `left < len(s)`: Since `left` is 2, this condition is true as long as `len(s)` is greater than 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `right` to be less than `len(s)`. Let's set `right` to `len(s) - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is len(s) - 1**
