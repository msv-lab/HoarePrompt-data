To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** `left < len(s)`
  - This condition ensures that the index `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.

- **Condition 2:** `s[left] != '1'`
  - This condition ensures that the character at index `left` in the list `s` is not '1'.

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and has specific values:
  - `s[0]` is '0'
  - `s[1]` is '0'
  - `s[2]` is '1'
  - `s[3]` is '1'
  - `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'
- `left` is 2.
- `right` is `len(s)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **For `left < len(s)` to hold true:** 
  - Since `left` is 2 and `s` has at least 4 elements (as per the given values `s[0]`, `s[1]`, `s[2]`, `s[3]`), this condition is already satisfied.

- **For `s[left] != '1'` to hold true:**
  - Currently, `left` is 2, and `s[2]` is '1'. Therefore, the condition `s[left] != '1'` is not satisfied.
  - To satisfy this condition, we need to change `left` to an index where `s[left]` is '0'.
  - From the given information, `s[0]` and `s[1]` are both '0'. We can set `left` to either 0 or 1.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to set `left` to an index where `s[left]` is '0'. The simplest adjustment is to set `left` to 0.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 0; `right` is `len(s)`**.
