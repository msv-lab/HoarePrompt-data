The code swaps the elements at indices `left` and `right` in the list `s`. Given that `s[left]` is '1' and `s[right]` is '0', after the swap, `s[left]` will be '0' and `s[right]` will be '1'. The other variables (`sChar`, `left`, `cost`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0; `right` is 1; `s[right]` is '1' and `s[left]` is '0'.**
