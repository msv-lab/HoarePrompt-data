To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'.
- `left` is 3.
- `right` is 4.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `right < len(s)`: Since `right` is 4, this condition will be true as long as `len(s)` is greater than 4.
2. `s[right] != '0'`: Since `right` is 4 and `s[3]` is '1', `s[4]` must be '1' for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure:
- `len(s)` is greater than 4.
- `s[4]` is '1'.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop only depends on the `right` index and the value at that index in the list `s`.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[4]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is 4; `len(s)` must be greater than 4**
