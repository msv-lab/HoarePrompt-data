### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by trying to swap '0's and '1's in a specific manner to achieve a sorted binary string. However, there are several issues with the logic implemented in the `func_1` function that lead to incorrect results.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is flawed. The cost should be the length of the substring being cyclically shifted, but the code simply adds `right - left + 1` whenever a swap is made, which does not accurately reflect the cost of a cyclic shift operation.
   
2. **Swapping Instead of Cyclic Shifting**: The code performs simple element-wise swapping between '0' and '1', which does not correspond to the cyclic shifting operation described in the problem statement.

3. **Inefficient Handling of Substrings**: The code does not correctly handle the concept of cyclically shifting substrings. It only considers swapping individual elements, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as intended.

4. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for moving `left` and `right` pointers is incorrect. The code does not properly account for the need to cyclically shift entire substrings to achieve the desired sorted order.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to focus on cyclically shifting substrings to move all '0's to the beginning and all '1's to the end. The cost of each operation should be the length of the substring being shifted. A more appropriate approach would involve identifying segments of '0's and '1's and calculating the cost of shifting them into place.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the current implementation of the `func_1` function is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
