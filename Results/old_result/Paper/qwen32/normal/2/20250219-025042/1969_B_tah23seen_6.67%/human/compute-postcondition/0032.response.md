The given code snippet increments the variable `cost` by the value of `right - left + 1`. Given the initial state, we know the values of `left` and `right`.

- `left` is 2.
- `right` is `len(s) - 1`. Since `s` contains all the elements from `sChar` and we know the first four elements of `s` ('0', '0', '1', '1'), we can infer that `len(s)` is at least 4. However, since the exact length of `s` is not specified beyond these four elements, we will assume `len(s)` is exactly 4 for the purpose of calculating the specific increment to `cost`.

Thus, `right` is `4 - 1 = 3`.

Now, `cost` is incremented by `right - left + 1`, which is `3 - 2 + 1 = 2`.

Therefore, the value of `cost` increases by 2.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is len(s) - 1; `cost` is increased by 2.**
