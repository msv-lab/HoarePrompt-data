To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `mexsize`. The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`. If `sz` matches `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1. This process continues until all elements in `a` have been processed.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initially, `mexsize` is set to 1.
2. The loop starts iterating over the sorted list `a`.
3. For each element `sz` in `a`, if `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
4. This process continues until all elements in `a` have been checked.

After the loop completes, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`.

Let's formalize this:

- If `a` contains the integers from 1 up to some number `k` consecutively, `mexsize` will be `k + 1` after the loop.
- If there is a gap in the sequence (i.e., not all integers from 1 to `k` are present), `mexsize` will be the smallest missing integer.

Thus, the final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not found in the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `mexsize`.
