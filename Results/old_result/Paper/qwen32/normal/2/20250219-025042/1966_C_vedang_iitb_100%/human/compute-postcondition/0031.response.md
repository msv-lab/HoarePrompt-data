Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is 2; `tc` is `tc + 1`. The current value of `sz` is equal to `mexsize`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
