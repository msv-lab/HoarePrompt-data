The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` was incremented by 1 (`tc = tc + 1`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `tc` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then the current value of `mexsize` remains greater than `maxsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
