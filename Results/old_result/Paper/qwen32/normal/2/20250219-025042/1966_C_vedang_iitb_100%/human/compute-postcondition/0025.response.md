The code snippet provided reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means the previous list stored in `a` is replaced with the new input list. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `tc` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`.**
