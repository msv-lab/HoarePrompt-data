Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` remains the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize` and represents the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**
