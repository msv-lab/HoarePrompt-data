Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is 1; `tc` is `tc + 1`. The current value of `sz` is equal to `mexsize`.**
