To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state:

- `mexsize` is described as the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- The `print` statement uses this `mexsize` to decide between printing 'Alice' or 'Bob'. Specifically, it checks if `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`) and prints 'Alice' if true, otherwise it prints 'Bob'.

Given this, we need to consider the possible values of `mexsize`:
- If `mexsize` is an odd number (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...), the condition `mexsize % 2 == 1` evaluates to `True`, and 'Alice' will be printed.
- If `mexsize` is an even number (e.g., 2, 4, 6, ...), the condition `mexsize % 2 == 1` evaluates to `False`, and 'Bob' will be printed.

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is dependent on the specific contents of the list `a`, we cannot determine a single numerical value for `mexsize` without knowing `a`. However, we can describe the output based on the parity (oddness or evenness) of `mexsize`.

Therefore, the output will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.

Output: **Alice if mexsize is odd, Bob if mexsize is even (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
