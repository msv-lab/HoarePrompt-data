The code snippet provided is `a.sort()`. This line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, and `tc`) are not affected by this operation.

Since `a` was already described as a sorted list of integers in the initial state, executing `a.sort()` does not change the list `a` because it is already sorted. Therefore, the values of `maxsize` (the maximum value in the list `a`) and `mexsize` (the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
