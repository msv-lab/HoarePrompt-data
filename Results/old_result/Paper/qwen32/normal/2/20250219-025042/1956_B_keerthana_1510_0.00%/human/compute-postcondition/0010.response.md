Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. Each integer in the list `a` is between 1 and `n`, and each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
