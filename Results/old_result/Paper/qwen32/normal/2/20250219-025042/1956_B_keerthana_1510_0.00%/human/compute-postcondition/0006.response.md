The only object in the loop head is the variable `line`. According to the code, the loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line (index 2) of the input file.

At the end of the previous iteration, `line` held the content of the last processed line. For the loop to execute one more time, `line` needs to hold the content of the next line to be processed, which is two lines ahead from the current `line`.

Given the structure of the input:
- The first line is `t`, the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines: the first is `n`, the number of integers, and the second is the list of integers.

Since the loop skips the first line (`t`) and processes every second line starting from the third line, the next `line` should be the line following the current `line`.

Let's denote the current `line` as `line_k`. The next `line` to be processed will be `line_(k+2)`.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `line` should be updated to the next line in the sequence, which is two lines ahead of the current `line`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace; `line` holds the content of the next line to be processed in the loop, which is two lines ahead of the current `line`.**
