The given code snippet redefines the `nums` list to contain powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` will now be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

The previous definition of `nums` included additional elements like `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and had one element `1 << idx` removed. These modifications are no longer relevant because the new assignment completely replaces the old `nums` list.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `idx` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is less than 1; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**
