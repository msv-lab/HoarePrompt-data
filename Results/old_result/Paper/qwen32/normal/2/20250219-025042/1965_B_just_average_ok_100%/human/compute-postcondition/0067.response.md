The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. This changes the length of `nums` by adding one more element to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `idx` is the index of the largest element in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or 20 if `k` is greater than 1048576; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`]**.
