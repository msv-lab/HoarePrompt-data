### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to see if it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with the first 21 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)).
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is greater than \(2^{20}\), `idx` remains -1.
   - It removes the power of 2 corresponding to `idx` from `nums`.
   - It appends three new elements to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of the modified `nums` list.
   - It prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Condition 1**: There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully selecting the elements in `nums`. Specifically, it removes a power of 2 that would otherwise allow `k` to be formed and replaces it with values that do not form `k` when summed with other elements.

- **Condition 2**: For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
  - The inclusion of the first 21 powers of 2 allows for the formation of many sums using binary representation. By strategically replacing one of these powers with specific values, the program ensures that all sums except `k` can still be formed.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `nums` initially: `[1]`
  - `idx` is set to 0 because `1 <= 2`.
  - `nums` becomes: `[2, 3, 4]` after modifications.
  - Subsequences: `[1]` forms `1`, no subsequence forms `2`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 1`
  - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
  - `idx` is set to 0 because `1 <= 1`.
  - `nums` becomes: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` after modifications.
  - Subsequences: `[1]` forms `1`, no subsequence forms `2`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 8`, `k = 8`
  - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
  - `idx` is set to 3 because `8 <= 8`.
  - `nums` becomes: `[1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 11]` after modifications.
  - Subsequences: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[4]`, `[1, 2]`, `[1, 4]`, `[2, 4]`, `[1, 2, 4]` form `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, no subsequence forms `8`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 9`, `k = 3`
  - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
  - `idx` is set to 1 because `2 <= 3`.
  - `nums` becomes: `[1, 4, 5, 6, 7]` after modifications.
  - Subsequences: `[1]`, `[4]`, `[1, 4]`, `[5]`, `[1, 5]`, `[6]`, `[1, 6]`, `[7]` form `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, no subsequence forms `3`.

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
  - `nums` initially: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
  - `idx` is set to 2 because `4 <= 7`.
  - `nums` becomes: `[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]` after modifications.
  - Subsequences: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 2]`, `[5]`, `[1, 5]`, `[2, 5]`, `[1, 2, 5]`, `[8]`, `[1, 8]`, `[2, 8]`, `[1, 2, 8]`, `[5, 8]`, `[1, 5, 8]`, `[2, 5, 8]`, `[1, 2, 5, 8]`, `[9]`, `[1, 9]`, `[2, 9]`, `[1, 2, 9]`, `[5, 9]`, `[1, 5, 9]`, `[2, 5, 9]`, `[1, 2, 5, 9]` form `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, no subsequence forms `7`.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly generate sequences that satisfy both conditions for the given test cases.
