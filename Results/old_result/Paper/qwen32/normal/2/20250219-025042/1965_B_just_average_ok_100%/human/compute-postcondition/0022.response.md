To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables `t`, `n`, and `k`:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

2. **List `nums`:**
   - `nums` starts with a predefined list of powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - It then includes two additional elements: `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`.
   - It also includes another element: `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` from the list.

3. **Index `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is greater than 1048576.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `idx`:**
   - `idx` is determined by finding the largest power of 2 in the predefined list that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than 1048576, `idx` is -1.

2. **Constructing `nums`:**
   - Start with the predefined list of powers of 2.
   - Add `k - nums[idx]` to the list.
   - Add `k + 1` to the list.
   - Add `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
   - Remove `1 << idx` from the list.

3. **Calculating the Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, there are 22 elements in the predefined list.
   - Three additional elements are added: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - One element is removed: `1 << idx`.
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is `22 + 3 - 1 = 24`.

### Conclusion:

The length of the list `nums` after all modifications is always 24, regardless of the specific values of `k` and `idx`.

### Final Output:

Output: **24**
