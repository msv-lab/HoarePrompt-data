The code snippet provided increments the variable `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `i` was either 0 or 1. After executing `i += 1`, `i` will be 1 or 2 respectively. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 1 or 2; `temp` is multiplied by 2.**
