The given code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `ans`. Specifically, it calculates `(1 << i) - 1` and appends this value to `ans`. Here, `1 << i` represents a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to \(2^i\). Therefore, the expression `(1 << i) - 1` computes \(2^i - 1\).

Given the initial state, the only variable that is modified by this code is `ans`. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the single element `(1 << i) - 1`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
