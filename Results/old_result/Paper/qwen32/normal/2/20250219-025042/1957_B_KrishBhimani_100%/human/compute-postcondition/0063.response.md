The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. 

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` initially contains one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`. This is a power of 2 minus 1.
- `sum(ans)` would thus be equal to `(1 << i) - 1`.
- The new element being appended to `ans` is `k - sum(ans)`, which simplifies to `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

After this operation, `ans` will have two elements: the original `(1 << i) - 1` and the newly appended `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
