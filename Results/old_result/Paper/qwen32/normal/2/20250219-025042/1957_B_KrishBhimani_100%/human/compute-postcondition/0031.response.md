The code snippet appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` initially contains one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`. After appending `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`, the new state of `ans` will include this additional element.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ans` originally contains `[(1 << i) - 1]`.
- The new element being appended is `k - sum(ans)`, which simplifies to `k - ((1 << i) - 1)` because `sum(ans)` is just the single element `(1 << i) - 1`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` list will be `[ (1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1) ]`.

Other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.**
