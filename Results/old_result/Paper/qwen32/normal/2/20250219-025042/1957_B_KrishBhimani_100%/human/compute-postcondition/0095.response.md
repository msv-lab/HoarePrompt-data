The given code snippet appends a value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\). 

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly impacted by this line of code is `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` remains a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.
- `k` remains the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`.
- If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made; otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.
- `k0` remains equal to `k`.
- `ans` now contains one element, which is \((1 << i) - 1\).
- `i` remains the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated.
- `temp` remains the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `(1 << i) - 1`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
