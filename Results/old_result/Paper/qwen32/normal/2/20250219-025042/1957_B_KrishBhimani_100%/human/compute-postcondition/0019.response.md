Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `n` is not equal to 1
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not
- `ans` is an empty list
- `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `temp` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
temp *= 2
```

Impact:
- The value of `temp` is doubled.

Calculation:
- If `temp` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `temp` was 2, it becomes 4.

Since `i` and `k0` are not affected by this operation, and no other variables are modified, the output state remains the same except for the value of `temp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2 or 4 depending on its previous value.**
