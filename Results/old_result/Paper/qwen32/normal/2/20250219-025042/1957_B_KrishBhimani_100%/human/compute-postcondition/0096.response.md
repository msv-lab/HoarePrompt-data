The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is a list containing one element, `(1 << i) - 1`.

After the operation `ans.append(k - sum(ans))`:
- The new element added to `ans` is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains two elements: `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
