The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is greater than 0
- `c` is the first integer from the new input
- `r` is the second integer from the new input
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing `num += 2`, the value of `num` is increased by 2. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `num` is increased by 2**.
