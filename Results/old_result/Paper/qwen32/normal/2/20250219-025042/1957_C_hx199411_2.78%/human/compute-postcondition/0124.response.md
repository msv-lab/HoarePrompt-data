To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is at least 1 (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `k` is the number of iterations from the input (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `m` is at least 5.
- `num` is calculated based on the conditions `c == r` and `c != r` during iterations (not used in the provided code snippet).
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific initial values:
  - `dp[1] = 1`
  - `dp[2] = 3`
  - `dp[3] = 7`
  - `dp[4] = 25`
  - `dp[5] = 81`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `dp[m]`. Given that `m` is at least 5 and the initial values of `dp` are explicitly provided, we need to consider the value of `dp[m]` based on the given initial values.

Since `m` is at least 5, and the initial values of `dp` up to `dp[5]` are provided, we can directly use the value of `dp[5]` if `m` is exactly 5. If `m` were greater than 5, the value of `dp[m]` would not be explicitly provided in the initial state, and we would need more information about how `dp` is updated. However, since the problem does not specify any further updates to `dp` after the initial values, we assume `m` is exactly 5 based on the minimum requirement.

### Conclusion:
Given that `m` is at least 5 and the initial value of `dp[5]` is 81, the value of `dp[m]` when `m` is 5 is 81.

Output: **81**
