Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the number of iterations from the input.
- `m` is initially defined as `n - num`.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.
- `m` is then explicitly set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `num`, `c`, `r`). The value to be printed is explicitly given as `1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will simply print the number `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
