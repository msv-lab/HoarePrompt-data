The given code updates the `dp` list at index `i` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This means that the value at `dp[i]` is now calculated based on the previous values in the list.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `dp[i]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged because they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

The new value of `dp[i]` is calculated as follows:
- `dp[i]` is set to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `dp[i]`. However, we know that the formula above is applied to determine its new value.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations and `num` must be less than or equal to `n - 3`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be greater than 2, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
