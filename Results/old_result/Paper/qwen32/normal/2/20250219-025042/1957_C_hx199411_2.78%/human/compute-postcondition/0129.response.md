Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of a grid and `k` is the number of moves made on the grid. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the coordinates of each move within the grid. The function returns a result for each test case based on the described inputs.**
