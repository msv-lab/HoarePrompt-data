To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `dp[m]` is the final value computed by a loop.
- `m` is defined as `n - num` and it is given that `m > 2`.

From this, we know that `dp[m]` holds a specific value that was computed after the loop finished executing. However, the exact value of `dp[m]` is not explicitly given in the initial state. We only know how `m` is calculated (`m = n - num`) and that `m` must be greater than 2.

Given these constraints, the output of the `print(dp[m])` statement will be the value stored in `dp[m]` after the loop completes. Since we don't have the specific value of `dp[m]`, we can only describe it in terms of the computation that led to it.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the final value computed by the loop for m = n - num and m > 2)**
