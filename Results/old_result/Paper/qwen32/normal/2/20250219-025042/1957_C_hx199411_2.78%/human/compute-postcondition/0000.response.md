Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
