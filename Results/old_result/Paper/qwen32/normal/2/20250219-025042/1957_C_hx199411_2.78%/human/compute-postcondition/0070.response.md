Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is mentioned that `t` is `t - 1`, but there is no initial value for `t` provided. This suggests that `t` might be modified somewhere else in the code, but for the purpose of this `print` statement, it is irrelevant since the print statement does not reference `t`.

2. **Variable `n`:** It is the first integer from the input. Since the exact input is not provided, we can denote it as `n`.

3. **Variable `k`:** It is the second integer from the input. Similarly, since the exact input is not provided, we can denote it as `k`.

4. **Variable `num`:** It is described as the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2. Without knowing the specific increments, we can denote it as `num`.

5. **Variable `m`:** It is initially defined as `n - num`, but later it is explicitly stated that `m` is equal to 1. Therefore, the value of `m` is 1.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The code snippet contains only one line:
```python
print(1)
```

This line directly prints the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:

The `print` statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m` because the print statement is hardcoded to print `1`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **1**
