The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` was initially 0. After the increment, `num` becomes 2.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 2, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
