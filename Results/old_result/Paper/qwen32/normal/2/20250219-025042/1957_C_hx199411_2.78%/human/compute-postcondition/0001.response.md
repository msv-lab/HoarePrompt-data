To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. In this case, the loop is:

```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t` is truthy). Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already guaranteed that `t` will be non-zero initially. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `t` and it is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute, we can simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
