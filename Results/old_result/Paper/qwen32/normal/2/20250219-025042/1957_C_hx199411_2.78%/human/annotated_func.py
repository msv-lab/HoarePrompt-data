#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num

            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1

            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)

    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the `n` value from the last test case, `k` is the `k` value from the last test case, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the last test case's moves, `m` is `n - num` for the last test case, and `dp` is the dynamic programming results up to `dp[m]` if `m > 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid size `n` and a number of moves `k`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the positions of the moves within the grid and prints the result for that test case.
