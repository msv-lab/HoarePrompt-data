The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` starts at 0, so after executing this line, `num` will be 2.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 1, `num` is 2, `m` is 0 or 1 or any other value (if `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81), `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
