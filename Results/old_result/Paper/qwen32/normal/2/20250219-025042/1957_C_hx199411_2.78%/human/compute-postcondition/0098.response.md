The code snippet increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `num` was initially set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise it was set to 2. After the increment operation, if `num` was initially 1, it will now be 2, and if `num` was initially 2, it will now be 3.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 1, `m` is 0 or 1 or any other value (if `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81), `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r` else `num` is 3, `i` is incremented by 1**.
