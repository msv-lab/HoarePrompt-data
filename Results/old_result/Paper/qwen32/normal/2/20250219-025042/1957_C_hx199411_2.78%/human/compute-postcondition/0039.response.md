To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and updates the `dp` array.

### Initial Setup:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be greater than 2.
- `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.

### Loop Execution:
The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m` and updates `dp[i]` using the formula:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration (`i = 3`), `dp[3]` is calculated.
- After 2 iterations (`i = 4`), `dp[4]` is calculated as 18.
- After 3 iterations (`i = 5`), `dp[5]` is calculated.

### General Formula:
For each `i` from 3 to `m`, the value of `dp[i]` is computed using the given formula.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all iterations, `dp[m]` will hold the final result. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the `dp` array will be fully populated up to `dp[m]`.

### Calculation:
Let's assume `m` is 5 for simplicity (since the exact value of `m` is not provided, but we know it's greater than 2). We already know:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`
- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 4) % (10^9 + 7) = 7`
- `dp[4] = 18` (given)
- `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (18 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (18 + 56) % (10^9 + 7) = 74`

If `m` were larger, we would continue this process until `dp[m]`.

### Final State:
Assuming `m` is 5, the final state of `dp` would be `[0, 1, 3, 7, 18, 74]`.

### Output State:
Output State: **dp[m] is the final value computed by the loop, where m is n - num and m > 2.**

In natural language, the final output state is that the `dp` array will be fully computed up to `dp[m]`, where `m` is the difference between `n` and `num`, and `m` is greater than 2. The specific value of `dp[m]` depends on the exact value of `m` and the calculations performed within the loop.
