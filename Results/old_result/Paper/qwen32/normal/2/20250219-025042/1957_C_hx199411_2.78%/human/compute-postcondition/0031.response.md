The code snippet sets the second element of the list `dp` (which is at index 1) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1.**
