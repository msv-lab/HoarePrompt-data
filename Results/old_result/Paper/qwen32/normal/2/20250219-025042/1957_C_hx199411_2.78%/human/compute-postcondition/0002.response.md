Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
