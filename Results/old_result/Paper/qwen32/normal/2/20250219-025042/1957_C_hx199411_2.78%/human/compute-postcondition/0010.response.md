The code snippet increments the variable `num` by 2. Initially, `num` is 0, so after the operation, `num` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
