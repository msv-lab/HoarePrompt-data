The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a specific string `'##..##..'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the String to Print**: The `print` statement directly specifies the string `'##..##..'` to be printed.
2. **Check Dependencies**: The string does not contain any variables or expressions that would change its value based on the initial state.
3. **Determine Output**: Since the string is explicitly defined and does not depend on any external factors, the output will be exactly as specified.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##..**
