Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('##..##..')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'##..##..'`. There are no variables or conditions affecting the content of the string being printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c` do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the exact string `'##..##..'`.

Output: **##..##..**
