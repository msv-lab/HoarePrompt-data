Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer and its current value is 4.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 0.
- `n` is not equal to 1, 2, or 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'..##..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. It is a static string literal.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'..##..##'` as it is, without any modifications or substitutions from the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **..##..##**
