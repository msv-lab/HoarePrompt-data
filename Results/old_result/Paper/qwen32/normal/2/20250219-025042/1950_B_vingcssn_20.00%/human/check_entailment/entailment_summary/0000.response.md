Reasoning: The provided program is designed to handle only specific values of `n` (1 through 4). It correctly prints the checkerboard patterns for these values as per the problem statement. However, the problem description specifies that `n` can be up to 20. The current implementation does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, instead printing "No esta en el rango" for those cases. This makes the program incorrect according to the problem requirements, which demand that the program should generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any `n` within the range [1, 20].

Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it does not meet the full scope of the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
