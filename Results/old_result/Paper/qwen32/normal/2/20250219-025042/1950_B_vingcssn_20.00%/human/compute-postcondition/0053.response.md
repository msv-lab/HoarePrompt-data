The provided initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`) but does not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement outputs a fixed string `'..##..##'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('..##..##')`.
2. The string `'..##..##'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.
3. No variables or conditions are used within the string that would change its value based on the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is always `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
