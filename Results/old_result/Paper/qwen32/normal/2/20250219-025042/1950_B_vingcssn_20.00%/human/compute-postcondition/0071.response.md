In this task, the initial state provides us with several variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`) along with their constraints and values. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'##..##'`.

Let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 2.

None of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **##..##**
