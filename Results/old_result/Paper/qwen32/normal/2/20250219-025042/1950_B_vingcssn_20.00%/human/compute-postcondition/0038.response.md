Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('##')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is `print('##')`. This statement explicitly prints the string `'##'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'##'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##**
