In this task, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement given the initial state of the variables. Let's analyze the provided information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 1.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'..##..##'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
