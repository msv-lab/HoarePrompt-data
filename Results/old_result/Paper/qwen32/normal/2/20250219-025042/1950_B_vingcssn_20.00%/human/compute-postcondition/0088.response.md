Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, `casos` is greater than 0, and `c` is 2. If `n` equals 2, the values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c` remain unchanged. If `n` equals 3, the values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c` also remain unchanged.**
