The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string, `'No esta en el rango'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is set to 1.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will simply be the string `'No esta en el rango'`.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
