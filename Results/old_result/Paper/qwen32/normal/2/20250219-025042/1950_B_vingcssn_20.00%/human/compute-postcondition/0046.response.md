The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'..##..'`. This string is explicitly defined within the `print` function and does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 1.

None of these variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'..##..'`.

Output: **..##..**
