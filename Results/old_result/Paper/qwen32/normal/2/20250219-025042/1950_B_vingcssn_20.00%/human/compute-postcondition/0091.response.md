Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) and `n` represents an integer for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The function processes each test case and returns a specific result based on the value of `n` for each case.**
