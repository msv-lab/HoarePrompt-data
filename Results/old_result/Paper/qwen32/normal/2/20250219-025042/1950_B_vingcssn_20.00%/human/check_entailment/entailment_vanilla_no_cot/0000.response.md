Correctness: **False**

The provided program only handles specific values of `n` (1 through 4) and outputs hardcoded results for these cases. It does not handle other values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Additionally, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" for `n` greater than 4, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The program should dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid value of `n`.
