To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information and the behavior of the loop.

### Loop Analysis
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
- For each iteration `i`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`.
- It then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `cnt > 0` and `l < n + 1`.
- Inside the `while` loop, it prints a query and updates `l` based on the result of `func_2()`.
- If `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` reaches `n + 1`, it prints an answer and returns.

### Given Conditions
- After 3 iterations, we know that `n >= 3 * k` and the loop has not yet terminated (i.e., `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not `n + 1`).
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n // k`.

### Final Output State
- The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n // k`.
- At the end of the loop, `cnt` should be `0` and `l` should be `n + 1` for the loop to print the answer and return.
- The value of `v` remains the same throughout the loop unless the loop breaks early when `v` equals `n`.

### Conclusion
After all iterations, the loop will have run `n // k` times. The final state will be when `i` is `n // k`, `cnt` is `0`, and `l` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `n // k`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the loop will have completed running `n // k` times. The final state will be that `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `n // k`. The value of `v` remains unchanged from its initial value unless the loop breaks early when `v` equals `n`.
