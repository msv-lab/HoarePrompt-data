Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `i` is set to 3.
- The variable `v` is mentioned but does not affect the print statement directly. It is used in a conditional context (`if v == n`) but this condition does not influence the print statement we are examining.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Here, we need to determine the value of `i * n`:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, `i * n` will be `3 * n`.

Thus, the print statement will output a string that starts with `? 1` followed by the product of `i` and `n`.

Output: **? 1 3n (where n is a positive integer)**
