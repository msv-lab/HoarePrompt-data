The code snippet updates the value of `l` by setting it to `func_2() + 1`. Given that `l` was previously defined as `func_2() + 1` during the initial state, executing this line again will reassign `l` to the same value it was initially set to, assuming `func_2()` returns the same value in both instances.

Therefore, the only change is that `l` is reassigned to `func_2() + 1`, which does not alter its value since it was already set to this expression in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `3 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`) and `v < n`, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `3`**
