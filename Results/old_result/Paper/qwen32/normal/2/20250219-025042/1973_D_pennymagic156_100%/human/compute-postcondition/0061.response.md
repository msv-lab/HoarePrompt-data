Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be `>= n + 1` if the loop terminated early, `i` is `2`. It is not the case that `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1`.**
