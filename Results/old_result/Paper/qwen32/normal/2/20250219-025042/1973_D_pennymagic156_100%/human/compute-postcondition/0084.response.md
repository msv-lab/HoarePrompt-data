Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the current iteration (`i = n // k`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `n // k`.**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, and its return value updates the variable `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
