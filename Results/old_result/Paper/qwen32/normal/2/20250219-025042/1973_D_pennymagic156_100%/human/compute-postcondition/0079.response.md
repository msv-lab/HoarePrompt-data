To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of calling `func_2()`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we will assume that `func_2()` modifies the variable `v` and possibly other variables as per its definition. However, since no specific changes to `cnt` and `l` are mentioned in the code snippet, we will assume they remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`
- `k` is an integer such that `k <= n`
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`)
- `cnt` is `0`
- `l` is `n + 1`
- `i` is `3`

After executing `func_2()`, the only variable that might change is `v` (since no other variables are modified in the given code snippet).

Therefore, the output state would be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`; `k` is an integer such that `k <= n`; `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during this iteration; `cnt` is `0`; `l` is `n + 1`; `i` is `3`.**
