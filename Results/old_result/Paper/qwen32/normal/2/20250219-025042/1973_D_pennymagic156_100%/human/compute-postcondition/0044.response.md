To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, the loop will execute if both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l < n + 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is `1`.
- `i` is `2`.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `cnt` is `k`, and since `1 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is guaranteed to be a non-zero positive integer, making it truthy.
2. `l` is `1`, and `n` is a positive integer, so `l < n + 1` is always true because `1 < n + 1` holds for any positive integer `n`.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are needed.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `i` is `2`**
