The code snippet reassigns the variable `v` to the value returned by the function `func_2()`. Since the initial state does not specify what `func_2()` returns, we can only say that `v` will now hold whatever value `func_2()` returns. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 4**.
