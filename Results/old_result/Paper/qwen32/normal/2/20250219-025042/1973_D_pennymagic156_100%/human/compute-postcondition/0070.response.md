The code snippet updates the value of `l` by setting it to `func_2() + 1`. Since `l` was previously defined as `func_2() + 1` and the code reassigns `l` to the same expression, the value of `l` remains unchanged. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `3`.**
