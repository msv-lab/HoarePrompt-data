The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The loop condition is `i in range(1, n // k + 1)`, meaning `i` must be less than `n // k + 1` for the loop to continue.

Since `i` is now 3, for the loop to execute again, `3 < n // k + 1` must hold true. This implies that `n // k` must be at least 3, or equivalently, `n >= 3 * k`.

The other variables (`k`, `v`, `cnt`, `l`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the given constraints.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be `>= n + 1` if the loop terminated early, `i` is `3`**
