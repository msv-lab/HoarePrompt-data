The code reassigns the variable `l` with the value of `func_2() + 1`. Since the original value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`, executing this line does not change the value of `l`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
