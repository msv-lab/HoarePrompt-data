To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition: `cnt` and `l`.

Given the loop condition `while cnt and l < n + 1:`, the loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is non-zero (truthy).
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

From the provided state:
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `i` is `3`.

### Analysis:

1. **Condition on `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`. For the loop to continue, `cnt` must be non-zero. Therefore, `k - 1 > 0` or equivalently `k > 1`. Since `k` is already given to be `1 <= k <= n`, we need to ensure `k > 1` for `cnt` to be truthy.

2. **Condition on `l`:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need `func_2() + 1 < n + 1` or equivalently `func_2() < n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, this condition should generally hold as long as `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than 1. The value of `l` should naturally satisfy `l < n + 1` given the constraints on `n` and the typical behavior of `func_2()`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `3`**
