To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is `1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `l` is explicitly given as `1`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). Since the exact value of `v` is not specified, we will represent it as `v`.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems like `i` should be `1` because `v` is the value returned during the last iteration with `i = 1`. If `i` were any other value, `v` would be the value from a different iteration, which contradicts the given information.
- Therefore, `i * v` would be `1 * v`, which simplifies to `v`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output `? 1 v`, where `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 v (where v is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration (i = 1))**
