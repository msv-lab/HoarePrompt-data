To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `results` list based on the conditions provided. Let's break down the logic:

1. The loop runs `t` times.
2. For each iteration:
   - An integer `n` is read (though it is not used in the logic).
   - A string `arr` is read.
   - The string `arr` is checked for the following conditions:
     - If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, `'no'` is appended to `results`.
     - If the count of '1's in `arr` is even and does not contain exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, `'yes'` is appended to `results`.
     - Otherwise, `'no'` is appended to `results`.

After `t` iterations, the `results` list will contain a series of `'yes'` and `'no'` based on the above conditions. The final output state will include the `results` list with all the appended values.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `t` and the inputs for each iteration, we can generalize the final state as follows:

- `start` and `end` remain unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `results` will contain a list of `'yes'` and `'no'` strings based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing `'yes'` and/or `'no'` based on the conditions evaluated during each of the `t` iterations.**

In simpler terms, the final output state will have the `results` list populated with `'yes'` and `'no'` strings according to the input conditions for each of the `t` iterations.
