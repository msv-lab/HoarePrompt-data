Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `results` is a list containing either ['no', 'yes'] or ['yes']; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input. The count of '1's in `arr` is even, and `arr` does not contain exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is not a substring of `arr`).**

Explanation: The `results` list, which was initially either empty or contained one element 'no', now contains 'yes' appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
