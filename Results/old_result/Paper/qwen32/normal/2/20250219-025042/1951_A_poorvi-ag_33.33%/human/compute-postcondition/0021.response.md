Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the new user input; if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, `results` contains one additional element `'no'`; `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1.**
