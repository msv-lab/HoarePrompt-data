The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, `results` includes `'no'`. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged. Additionally, `results` now includes `'yes'`.**
