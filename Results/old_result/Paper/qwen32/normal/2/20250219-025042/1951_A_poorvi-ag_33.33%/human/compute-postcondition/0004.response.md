The code snippet `arr = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `arr`. This does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, or `n`. 

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input.**
