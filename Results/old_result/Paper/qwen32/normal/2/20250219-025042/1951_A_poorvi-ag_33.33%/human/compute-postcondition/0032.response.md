The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `arr` containing exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring does not affect the execution of this specific line of code, which only modifies `results`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `results` includes `'no'`.**
