In the given task, the for loop iterates over the elements of the list `results`. The loop head contains only one variable, `r`, which takes on the values of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

To ensure the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The variables `start`, `end`, and `t` are not directly involved in the loop's execution since they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of the `results` list.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `['yes']` or `['no']`).**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
