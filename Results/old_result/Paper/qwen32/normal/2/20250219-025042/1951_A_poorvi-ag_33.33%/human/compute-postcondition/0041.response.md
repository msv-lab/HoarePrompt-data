To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers with the condition `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element.
- `r` is the next element in `results`.

Given this information, we know that `results` has at least one element, but we don't know the specific contents of the list. We also know that `r` is described as "the next element in `results`," but without more context about how `r` is determined (e.g., if it's the first element, the last element, or some other specific element), we can only say that `r` is an element from the `results` list.

Since the exact value of `r` cannot be determined from the provided information, we describe it in terms of its relationship to the `results` list.

Output: **r (where r is an element from the results list)**
