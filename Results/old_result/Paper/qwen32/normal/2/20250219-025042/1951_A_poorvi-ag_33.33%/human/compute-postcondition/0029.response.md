The code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `arr`. This means `arr` now holds the value entered by the user as a string. The values of `i`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user**.
