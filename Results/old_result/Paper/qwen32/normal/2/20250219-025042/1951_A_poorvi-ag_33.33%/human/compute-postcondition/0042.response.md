The only variable in the loop head is `r`, which is being iterated over the elements of the list `results`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `r` and how it relates to the elements in `results`.

Given:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element.
- `r` is the next element in `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `r` was the current element being processed from the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `results` to assign to `r`.

Let's assume that the current value of `r` corresponds to the `k`-th element in `results`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `r` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in `results`.

Since we don't have specific information about the length of `results` or the exact position of `r` in the list, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least two elements; `r` is the next element in `results` after the current one**

However, to be more precise, if we assume that `r` was the `k`-th element, then at the start of the next iteration, `r` should be the `(k+1)`-th element. But without loss of generality and adhering strictly to the given format, we can state:

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least two elements; `r` is the next element in `results`**

This ensures that there is at least one more element in `results` for `r` to take, allowing the loop to execute again.
