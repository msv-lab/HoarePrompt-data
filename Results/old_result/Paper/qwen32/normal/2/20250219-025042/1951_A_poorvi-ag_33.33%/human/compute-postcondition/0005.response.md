Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input. Additionally, `arr` contains exactly two occurrences of the character '1', and these occurrences are consecutive ('11' is a substring of `arr`).**
