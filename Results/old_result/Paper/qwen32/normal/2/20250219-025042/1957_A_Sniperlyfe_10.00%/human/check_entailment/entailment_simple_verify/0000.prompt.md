You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: freq = {1: 2, 5: 1}
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. The current implementation only considers forming squares (polygons with 4 sides) because it divides the frequency of each stick length by 4. However, the problem statement allows for the formation of regular polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
We can form two equilateral triangles (polygons with 3 sides) using the six sticks of length 2.

However, the provided program will output `1` because it only considers forming squares and thus divides the frequency by 4.

To fix this, the program should consider forming polygons with different numbers of sides (from 3 upwards) and calculate the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_polygons(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(arr)
    max_polygons = 0
    for length, count in freq.items():
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):
            polygons = count // sides
            max_polygons = max(max_polygons, polygons)
    return max_polygons

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_polygons(arr))
```

This corrected version considers forming polygons with any number of sides from 3 up to the count of each stick length and keeps track of the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.
