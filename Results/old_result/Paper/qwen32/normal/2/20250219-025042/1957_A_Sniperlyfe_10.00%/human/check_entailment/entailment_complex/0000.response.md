### Reasoning:
The provided program has a logical flaw in its implementation. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks. However, it incorrectly assumes that all polygons must be squares (i.e., it divides the frequency of each stick length by 4). This is not correct because regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Polygon Formation**: A regular polygon can have any number of sides \( k \geq 3 \). Therefore, for each unique stick length, we need to check how many polygons of different sizes can be formed, not just squares.

2. **Incorrect Division**: The current implementation divides the frequency of each stick length by 4, which only works for forming squares. It should consider forming polygons with 3, 4, 5, ..., up to the number of sticks available for that length.

3. **Test Cases**: The example provided in the problem statement shows that the program fails to correctly compute the maximum number of polygons. For instance, in the fourth test case, it should be able to form a pentagon (5 sides) and a square (4 sides), but the current implementation will return 0.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 4 sides.

Correctness: **False**
