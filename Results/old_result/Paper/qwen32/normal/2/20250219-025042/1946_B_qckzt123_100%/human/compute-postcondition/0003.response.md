The given code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within certain bounds, and these bounds remain unchanged after the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007.**

In natural language: The values of `T`, `t`, `a`, and `MOD` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are now set to the integers read from the input.
