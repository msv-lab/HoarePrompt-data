The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This operation updates the value of `a` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD`**.

In natural language: The list `a` has been updated to contain the new integers read from the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
