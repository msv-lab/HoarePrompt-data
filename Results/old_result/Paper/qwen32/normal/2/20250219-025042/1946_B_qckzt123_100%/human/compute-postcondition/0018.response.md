The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which takes on the value of the next element in the list `a` during each iteration. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `x` changes and what other variables might be affected as a result of this change.

Given the loop:
```python
for x in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is calculated as `max(tmp, max(tmp + x, 0))`.
- `tmp` is adjusted to `0` if `tmp < 0`, otherwise it becomes `tmp + x`.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `MOD` is 1000000007.
- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `x` is the current element in the list `a`.

For the next iteration:
- `x` will take the value of the next element in the list `a`.
- Since `tmp` and `t` depend on the value of `x`, they will be recalculated based on the new value of `x`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `MOD`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `x` and the potential changes to `tmp` and `t` based on this new value.

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp + x, 0))`; `tmp` is 0 if `tmp < 0`, otherwise `tmp` remains `tmp + x`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.** 

However, to be precise about the transition:
- `x` is now the next element in the list `a` (which was not specified in the previous state).
- `tmp` and `t` will be recalculated based on this new `x`.

Since we don't know the exact next element in the list `a`, we'll denote it as `a[j]` where `j` is the index of the next element.

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `max(tmp, max(tmp + a[j], 0))`; `tmp` is 0 if `tmp < 0`, otherwise `tmp` remains `tmp + a[j]`; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `x` is `a[j]`, the next element in the list `a`.**
