The code snippet `tmp += x` updates the value of `tmp` by adding the current value of `x` to it. Since `x` is the next element in the list `a`, the new value of `tmp` will be the sum of its previous value and `x`.

Given the initial state, `tmp` was defined as `0` if it was initially less than `0`, otherwise `tmp + x`. After executing `tmp += x`, the new value of `tmp` will be `tmp + x`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t_initial) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
