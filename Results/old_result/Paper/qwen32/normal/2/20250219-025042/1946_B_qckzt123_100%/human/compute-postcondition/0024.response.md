Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of `a`, `tmp` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `t` is the maximum subarray sum of `a`, and `MOD` is 1000000007. All other variables retain their initial values.
