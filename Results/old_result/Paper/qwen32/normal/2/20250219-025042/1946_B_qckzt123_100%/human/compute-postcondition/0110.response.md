The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that the loop runs for `i` in the range `k - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is the maximum subarray sum found multiplied by 2 modulo 1000000007, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD` recalculated to be within the range of 0 to 1000000006, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is the maximum subarray sum found multiplied by 2 modulo 1000000007, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD` recalculated to be within the range of 0 to 1000000006, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 1**.
