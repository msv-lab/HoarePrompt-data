The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k-1`. If `i` is less than `k-1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i` (which would be some value from 0 to `k-2`), and `k` is a constant that does not change. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 2, then taken modulo `MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`, `i` is `i + 1`**
