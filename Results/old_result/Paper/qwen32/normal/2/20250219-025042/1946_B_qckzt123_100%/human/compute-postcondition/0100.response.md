The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This does not affect any other variables directly. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
