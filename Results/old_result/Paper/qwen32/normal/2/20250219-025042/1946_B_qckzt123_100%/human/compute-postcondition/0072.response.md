The code snippet `t %= MOD` modifies the value of `t` by taking `t` modulo `MOD`. Given that `t` is initially the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 4, then taken modulo `MOD`, the operation `t %= MOD` does not change the value of `t` because `t` is already within the range defined by `MOD`.

Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 4, then taken modulo `MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`, `i` is `i + 1`**
