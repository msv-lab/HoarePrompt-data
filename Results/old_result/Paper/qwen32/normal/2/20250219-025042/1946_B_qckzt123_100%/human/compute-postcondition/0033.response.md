The code snippet `ans += t` increments the value of `ans` by `t`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially calculated as `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`. After adding `t` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` becomes `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t`.

Since the values of `T`, `t`, `tmp`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `MOD`, `s`, and `i` are not modified by the code snippet, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `((2 times the maximum subarray sum of `a`) % 1000000007) * 2 % 1000000007`; `tmp` is 0; `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t`; `i` is 1**
