Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than `m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` except `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` remains 0; `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` except `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` except `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` which is now `pairs_in_D - 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D - 1` is at least `k` (or `pairs_in_D` if `D[out_aa]` was 0), otherwise `fnd` is 0; `aa` is a list of strings with at least `max(m, n)` elements; `bb` is a new list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the counts of all elements in `bb`. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0.**
