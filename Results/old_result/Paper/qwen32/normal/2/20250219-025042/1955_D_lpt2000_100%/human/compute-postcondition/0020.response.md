Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `bb` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ k else 0, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. If `E[out_aa]` > 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is set to 0.**
