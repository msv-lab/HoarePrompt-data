Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` is greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `bb` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. The count of `in_aa` in `D` is incremented by 1. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` plus 1 if `C[in_aa]` > 0, otherwise it is the sum of the values in `D` minus 1 if `E[out_aa]` <= 0, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` with the count of `in_aa` incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` == 0, otherwise it is decremented by 1, and the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` > 0, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` with the count of `in_aa` decremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` > 0, and the count of `out_aa` in `C` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` <= 0. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` plus 1 if `C[in_aa]` > 0, otherwise it is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` with the count of `in_aa` incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` == 0, otherwise it is decremented by 1, except that the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` with the count of `in_aa` decremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` > 0, `fnd` is 2 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ k else 1, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and the count of `in_aa` in `C` is decremented by 1.** 

In simpler terms, the count of `in_aa` in the `C` Counter object is reduced by 1. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described in the initial state.
