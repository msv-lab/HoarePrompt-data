Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `aa` is a list of strings derived from the input; `bb` is a new list of strings derived from the latest input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the counts of all elements in `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer greater than `m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` except `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` remains 0; `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` except `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` except `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` which is now `pairs_in_D + 1` if `C[in_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `pairs_in_D - 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged; `fnd` is 2 if `pairs_in_D` (after adjustment) is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings with at least `max(m, n)` elements; `bb` is a new list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the counts of all elements in `bb`. Additionally, if `C[in_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is now `C[in_aa] - 1` and `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`; otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is 0 and `E[in_aa]` is now `E[in_aa] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than `m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` except `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` remains 0; `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` except `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` except `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged; if `C[in_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1`, otherwise `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 2`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` which is now `pairs_in_D + 1` if `C[in_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `pairs_in_D - 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged; `fnd` is 3 if `pairs_in_D` (after adjustment) is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 2; `aa` is a list of strings with at least `max(m, n)` elements; `bb` is a new list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the counts of all elements in `bb`. Additionally, if `C[in_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is now `C[in_aa] - 1` and `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`; otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is 0 and `E[in_aa]` is now `E[in_aa] + 1`. If `C[in_aa]` was initially greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1` and `C[in_aa]` is now `C[in_aa] - 1`; otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is now `E[in_aa] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than `m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` except `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` remains 0. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, `E[out_aa]` remains its original value before the increment; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged. `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1` if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged. `pairs_in_D` is adjusted based on the conditions: if `C[in_aa]` was initially greater than 0, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1; if `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, `pairs_in_D` is further incremented by 1 and `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`, `C[in_aa]` is now `C[in_aa] - 1`. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is now `E[in_aa] + 1`. `fnd` is set to 3 if `pairs_in_D` (after adjustment) is at least `k`; otherwise, `fnd` is set to 2. `aa` is a list of strings with at least `max(m, n)` elements, `bb` is a new list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the counts of all elements in `bb`, `in_aa` is the next element from `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the next element from `aa[:n - m]`. `fnd` is now `fnd + 1` if `pairs_in_D >= k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
