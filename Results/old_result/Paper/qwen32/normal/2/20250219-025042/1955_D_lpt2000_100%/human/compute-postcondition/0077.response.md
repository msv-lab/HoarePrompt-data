Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` and `n` are integers, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the final `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `k` is an integer, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in `bb`. Additionally, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and `E[out_aa]` is 0.**
