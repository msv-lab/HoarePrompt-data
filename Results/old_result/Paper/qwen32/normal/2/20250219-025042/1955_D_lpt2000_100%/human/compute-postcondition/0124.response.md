The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation does not affect the variables `D`, `E`, `C`, `pairs_in_D`, or `fnd` as they are not mentioned in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; D is the intersection of the last m elements of aa and bb, E is the difference between the last m elements of aa and D, C is the difference between bb and D, pairs_in_D is the sum of the values in D, fnd is the count of iterations where pairs_in_D was at least k**.
