The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to a string, and assigns these strings to the list `bb`. This means that `bb` will now contain the string representations of integers provided in the input.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `nabors` remain unchanged. Only `aa` and `bb` are relevant here, but since `aa` is not modified in the code snippet, it retains its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `bb` is a list of strings representing integers read from input.**
