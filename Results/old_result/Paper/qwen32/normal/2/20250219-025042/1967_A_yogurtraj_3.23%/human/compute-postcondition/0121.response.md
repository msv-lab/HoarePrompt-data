Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is `n - 6` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0, `rem` is `k % 6` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `rem` is 0, `i` is 5, `r` is `a[5] + k // 6` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `r` is `a[6]`, and `k` is 0 if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `k` is decreased by `6 * (a[6] - a[5])`.**
