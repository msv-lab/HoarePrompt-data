To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results. Here's a breakdown of the process:

### Loop Explanation:
- **Outer Loop (`for ii in range(int(input()))`)**: This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- **Inner Logic**:
  - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of elements), `k` (a non-negative integer), and a list `a` of `n` integers.
  - It sorts the list `a`.
  - It initializes `r` to the first element of `a`, `rem` to 0, and `y` to 0.
  - It iterates through the sorted list, checking if the remaining `k` can cover the cost of making all elements up to the current index equal to the next element.
  - If `k` is insufficient to cover the cost for any step, it calculates the new `r` based on the remaining `k` and breaks out of the loop.
  - If `k` is sufficient, it continues reducing `k` by the cost and updating `r`.
  - After the loop, if `k` is still not zero, it adjusts `r` based on the remaining `k`.
  - Finally, it prints the result based on the calculated `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. However, since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final output state is simply the printed result of the last test case.

### Output State Calculation:
Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final output state after all iterations is the printed result of the last test case. Therefore, the output state will be the result of the last test case processed.

### Final Output State Format:
Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

### Human-readable Description:
The final output state is the result printed for the last test case. This result is determined by the logic inside the loop for the last set of inputs (`n`, `k`, and `a`). Specifically, it is calculated based on the final values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` after processing the last test case.

### Example:
If the last test case has `n=5`, `k=10`, and `a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the final output state would be the result printed after processing this test case.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Since the problem doesn't provide specific values for the last test case, we cannot compute a numerical output. However, the format and description above capture the essence of the final state after all iterations.
