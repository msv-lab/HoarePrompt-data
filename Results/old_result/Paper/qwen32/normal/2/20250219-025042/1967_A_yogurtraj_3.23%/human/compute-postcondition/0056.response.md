The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which means the program will exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Given that no variables are being modified in this snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
