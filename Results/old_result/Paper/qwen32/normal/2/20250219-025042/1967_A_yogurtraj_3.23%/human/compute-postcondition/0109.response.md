Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `y` is `n - 5`, `rem` is `k % 5`, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
