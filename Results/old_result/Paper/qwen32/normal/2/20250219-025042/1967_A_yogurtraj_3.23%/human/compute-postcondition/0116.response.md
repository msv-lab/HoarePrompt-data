The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 5 and `i` is 5, the new value of `y` is `n - 1 - 5`, which simplifies to `n - 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is `n - 6`, `rem` is `k % 6`, `i` is 5, `r` is `a[5] + k // 6`.**
