The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `y` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the first element of the list `a`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0.**
