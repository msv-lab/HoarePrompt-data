Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `k` is reduced by the sum of (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for all i from 0 to n - 2. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is equal to 0, then `r` remains `a[n - 2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by `n - 1`. If `k` is not 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % n`, `y` is `n - 1`, and `k` is the reduced value after the operations. If `k` is 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `k` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of integers, ii is incremented by 1, y is 0, rem is 0, and r is `a[n - 1] + k // n` if k is not equal to 0; otherwise, r is `a[n - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
