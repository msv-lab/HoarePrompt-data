The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged except for `r`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `r` will now hold the value of the element in `a` at the index `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
