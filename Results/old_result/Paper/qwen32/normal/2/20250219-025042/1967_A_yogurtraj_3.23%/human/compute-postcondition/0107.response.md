The code snippet `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y`. Given that `i` is 4, the new value of `y` will be `n - 1 - 4`, which simplifies to `n - 5`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `y` is `n - 5`, `rem` is `k % 5`, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`**
