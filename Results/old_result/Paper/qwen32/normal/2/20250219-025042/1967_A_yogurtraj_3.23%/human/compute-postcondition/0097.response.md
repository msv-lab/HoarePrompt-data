The given code snippet modifies the value of `y` based on the current value of `i` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `ii` is incremented by 1
- `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`
- `y` is 0
- `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`

The line `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
