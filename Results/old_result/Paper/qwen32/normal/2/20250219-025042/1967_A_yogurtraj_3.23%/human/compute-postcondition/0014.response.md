Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the first element of the list `a`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; and it is not the case that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)**
