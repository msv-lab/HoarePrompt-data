Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
