The value of `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is already given as `i + 1` in the initial state, so it remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
