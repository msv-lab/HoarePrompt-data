Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain as per their initial conditions, except `k` is now decreased by `a[r] * 2`.
