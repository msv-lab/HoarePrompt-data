Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The `sunks` variable also remains unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
