The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. `sunks` is increased by 1, but since the increment operation on `sunks` is specified in the initial state and not modified in the given code snippet, we consider only the decrement of `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` decreased by 1), `sunks` is increased by 1.**
