You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Analysis of the Program

The problem involves simulating the Kraken's attacks on a sequence of ships, where the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships until either all ships have sunk or the number of attacks (`k`) is exhausted. The program uses a two-pointer approach to track the first (`l`) and last (`r`) ships and processes the attacks accordingly.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program should handle scenarios where `n` is small (e.g., `n=1`), `k` is very large (e.g., `k >> n`), and various combinations of ship durabilities.
2. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for reducing the durability of the ships and counting the number of sunk ships should be accurate.
3. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints, the program should efficiently handle up to `2 * 10^5` ships and up to `10^15` attacks.

### Potential Issues

1. **Infinite Loop**: The program uses a `while l <= r` loop, but there are conditions where `l` and `r` might not update properly, leading to an infinite loop.
2. **Incorrect Attack Handling**: The program may not correctly handle cases where the number of remaining attacks (`k`) is exactly enough to sink a ship but not enough to start attacking the next one.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program might not handle cases where `k` is zero or where all ships have zero durability initially.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with some edge cases and typical cases to ensure it works correctly.

#### Test Case 1: Simple Case
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  ```
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Matches the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Test Case 2: All Ships Sunk Before `k` Attacks
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 10
  1 1 1
  ```
- Expected Output: `3`
- Explanation: All ships will sink before reaching 10 attacks.

#### Test Case 3: No Attacks (`k=0`)
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 0
  1 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: No attacks means no ships will sink.

#### Test Case 4: Single Ship
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1 1
  1
  ```
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: The single ship will sink with one attack.

#### Test Case 5: Large Number of Attacks
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 15
  1 5
  ```
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Both ships will sink with 15 attacks.

### Identifying a Bug

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the program might not handle cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship but not enough to start attacking the next one. Specifically, the condition checks like `if k >= a[l] * 2` might not correctly handle the edge case where `k` is just enough to sink one ship but not the other.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 3
  2 2
  ```
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `1` (or incorrect behavior)

In this case, the first attack reduces the first ship's durability to 1, the second attack reduces the second ship's durability to 1, and the third attack should sink the first ship, leaving the second ship with 1 durability. The fourth attack would sink the second ship, but since `k` is only 3, both ships should sink.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issue, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the number of remaining attacks (`k`) is exactly enough to sink a ship but not enough to start attacking the next one. This leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
