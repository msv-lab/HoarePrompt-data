Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the conditions for `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` remain as specified in the precondition. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `sunks` has been increased by 1, while all other variables retain their original values and constraints.
