Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `a[r]` remains the same, `sunks` remains the same.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `a[l]` is reduced by the value of `a[r]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `k`, and `sunks`) remain unchanged.
