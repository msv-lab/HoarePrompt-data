Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` (where `l` is less than or equal to `r`) is preserved. The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
