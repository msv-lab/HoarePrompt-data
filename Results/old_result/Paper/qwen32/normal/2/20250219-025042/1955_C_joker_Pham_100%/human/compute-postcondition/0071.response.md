Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is now `l + 1`, `r` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` was 0, then `r` is decreased by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` was not 0, then `r` remains unchanged, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. The conditions for breaking out of loops or if statements remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the changes made before the `continue` statement (such as incrementing `l`, modifying `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks`) are retained, and the loop continues with the next iteration.
