Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The values of `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2` is not equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a[r]`, `a[l]`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain the same. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
