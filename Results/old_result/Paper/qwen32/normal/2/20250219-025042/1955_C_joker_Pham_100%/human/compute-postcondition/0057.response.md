Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` must be less than or equal to `r` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
