Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is increased by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `a[r]` remains the same, and `sunks` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `l`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` retain their original values.**
