Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `a[r]` remains the same, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
