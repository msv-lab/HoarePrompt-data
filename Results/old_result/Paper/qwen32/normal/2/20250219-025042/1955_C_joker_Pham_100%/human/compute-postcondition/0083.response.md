The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `sunks`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is now `l + 1` and is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `a[r]` remains the same, `sunks` is increased by 1.**
