Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `r` is decreased by 1 and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, or if `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, or `sunks`. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, no changes are made to `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, or `sunks`.**
