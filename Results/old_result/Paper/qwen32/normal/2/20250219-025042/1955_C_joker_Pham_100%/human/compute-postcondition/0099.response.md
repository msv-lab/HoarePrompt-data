Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sunks` or the loop continues.**
