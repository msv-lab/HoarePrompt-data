The value of `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is now `l + 1` and is still less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`.**
