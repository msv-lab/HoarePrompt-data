`sunks` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and if `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `sunks` is incremented by 1.
