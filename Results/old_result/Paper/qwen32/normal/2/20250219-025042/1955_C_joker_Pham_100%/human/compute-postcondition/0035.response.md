Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `k` is 0, then `a[r]` is either 0 or reduced by `a[l]`, `l` is incremented to `r + 1` or remains unchanged, `r` is adjusted to `n - 2` or `n - 1` based on `a[r]`, and `sunks` is set to 1 or 2. Otherwise, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values unless `k` equals `a[l] * 2 - 1`, in which case `sunks` is set to 1. If `a[l] > a[r]`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.**
