Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to the original `a[r] * 2`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `r` is decremented by 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`. If `k` is exactly equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, the values of `k`, `a`, `l`, `r` remain unchanged. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the values of `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `r` is decreased by 1 and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, or if `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, or `sunks`. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, no changes are made to `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, or `sunks`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then if `k >= a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, and `r` is decreased by 1, continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If `k < a[r] * 2`, the loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == a[r] * 2` or `k == 0`. If `k` is not 0 and `a[r] * 2 != k`, the behavior of `l`, `k`, and `sunks` depends on the conditions involving `a[l]` and `a[r]`: if `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` remains unchanged. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, none of the above conditions apply and the behavior is as specified in the else part, which is not provided.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
