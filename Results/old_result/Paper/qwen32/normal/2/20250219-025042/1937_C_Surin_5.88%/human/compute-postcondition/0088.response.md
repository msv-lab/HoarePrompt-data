Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the variables involved in the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer read from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\).
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the largest index \(i\) for which the input `r` was '<'.
- `prev` is set to 1 if `r` was '>', otherwise it remains 0.
- `kp` is incremented by 1 for each time `r` was '<'.
- `v2` is initialized to \(n-1\).
- `r` is either '>' or '<'.
- `i` is initialized to 2.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

#### Values of Variables:
- `v1`: This is the largest index \(i\) for which the input `r` was '<'. Since no specific value for `r` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1`. However, based on the precondition, `v1` is an index in the range \([0, n-1]\).
- `i`: This is explicitly given as 2.
- `prev`: This is set to 1 if `r` was '>', otherwise it remains 0. Since no specific value for `r` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `prev`. However, based on the precondition, `prev` is either 0 or 1.

### Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will be in the form `? v1 i v1 prev`, where `v1` and `prev` are determined by the input values of `r`.

Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest index i for which r was '<', and prev is 1 if r was '>', otherwise 0)**
