To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `v1` starts as the largest index for which `r` was `<`, initially `v1` is 0.
   - `prev` starts as 0.
   - `kp` is incremented by 1 for each time `r` was `<`.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `r` is the input string from the last iteration.
   - `i` starts at 1 and increments up to `n-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the program prints a query and reads the response `r`.
   - If `r` is `'>', prev` is updated to the current `i`.
   - If `r` is `'<'`, `v1` is updated to the current `i` and `kp` is incremented.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
   - `v1` will be the largest index `i` for which `r` was `'<'`.
   - `prev` will be the last index `i` for which `r` was `'>'`.
   - `kp` will be the total count of times `r` was `'<'`.
   - `v2` remains `n-1` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r` will be the result of the last comparison.
   - `t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, and `g` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, n is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, R is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, g is 0, v1 is the largest index i for which the input r was '<', prev is the last index i for which the input r was '>', kp is incremented by 1 for each time r was '<', v2 is n-1, r is the input string from the last iteration, i is n.**

In simpler terms, the loop finishes with `i` equal to `n`, `v1` being the highest index where the response was `'<'`, `prev` being the last index where the response was `'>'`, and `kp` counting the number of `'<'` responses. All other variables remain as they were initialized.
