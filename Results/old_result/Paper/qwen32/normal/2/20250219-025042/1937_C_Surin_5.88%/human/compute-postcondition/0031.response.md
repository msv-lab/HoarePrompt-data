To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `n`: An integer read from the input, between 2 and 10,000.
   - `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`: A permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
   - `I`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
   - `R`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
   - `g`: Initialized to 0.
   - `v1`: The largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`.
   - `prev`: Initialized to 0.
   - `i`: Not explicitly defined in the initial state but used in the print statement.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.
   - We need to determine the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev`.

3. **Determination of Values:**
   - `v1` is described as "the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`". This implies that `v1` is determined by some previous input processing, specifically where the character `'<'` was encountered.
   - `i` is used in the print statement but not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is used alongside `v1` in the context of indices, it is likely that `i` is also related to some input processing. However, without additional context about how `i` is set, we can only assume it is another index value relevant to the problem.
   - `prev` is initialized to 0 and does not change based on the given initial state.

Given the lack of specific values for `v1` and `i` in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions:

- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`.
- `i` is another index value, likely related to the same input processing context as `v1`.

Thus, the output will be in terms of these descriptions:

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] 0 (where v1 is the largest index i for which the input r was '<', and i is another index value related to the input processing context)**
