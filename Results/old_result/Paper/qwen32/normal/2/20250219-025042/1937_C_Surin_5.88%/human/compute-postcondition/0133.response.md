Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration, `v1` is the largest index j for which the input r was '<', `prev` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is updated to the newly read input from the current iteration. All other variables retain their previous values.
