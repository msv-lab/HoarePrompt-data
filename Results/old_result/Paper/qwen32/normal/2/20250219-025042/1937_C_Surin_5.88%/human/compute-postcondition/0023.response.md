To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer read from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
3. The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\).
4. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
5. `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
6. `i` is set to 5.
7. `v2` is set to 5.
8. `r` is the string read from the input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet uses an f-string to format and print a string.
- The string to be printed is `'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'`.
- The values of `v1` and `v2` need to be determined based on the initial state.

### Determining Values:
- `v2` is explicitly set to 5.
- `v1` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 4. Otherwise, `v1` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, so we must assume that `r` is `<` based on the information provided.

### Conclusion:
Given that `r` is `<`, `v1` is set to 4. Therefore, the values to be printed are:
- `v1` = 4
- `v2` = 5

Thus, the formatted string will be `'? 4 4 5 5'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 4 4 5 5**
