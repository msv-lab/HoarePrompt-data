To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n`: An integer read from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`: A permutation of \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\).
   - `I`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
   - `R`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
   - `g`: Set to 0.
   - `v1`: The largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`.
   - `prev`: Set to `i` if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged.
   - `r`: The input string.
   - `i`: Set to 4.

2. **Understanding the print statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.

3. **Determining the values of `v1` and `prev`:**
   - `v1` is defined as the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`. Since there is no specific information about the input `r` and the sequence of inputs, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1` from the given information.
   - `prev` is set to `i` if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise it remains unchanged. Again, without knowing the sequence of inputs, we cannot determine the exact value of `prev`.

Given these uncertainties, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables `v1` and `prev` as they are defined in the problem statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [v1] 4 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest index i for which the input r was '<', and prev is i if r was '>', otherwise prev remains unchanged)**
