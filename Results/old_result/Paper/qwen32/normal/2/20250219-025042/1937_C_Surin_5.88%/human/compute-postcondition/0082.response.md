The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. It does not affect any of the variables or their values.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`, `r`, `i`) are modified by this command.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which the input `r` was '<', `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each time `r` was '<', `v2` is n-1, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `i` is 1**.
