The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it only flushes the output buffer to ensure that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, or `v1` are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.**
