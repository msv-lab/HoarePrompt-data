To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the relevant variables involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n`: An integer read from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`: A permutation of \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\).
- `I`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
- `R`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
- `g`: Initialized to 0.
- `v1`: Initialized to 0.
- `prev`: The largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`.
- `kp`: Incremented by 1.
- `v2`: Set to `i`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `v1`: Initialized to 0.
- `v2`: Set to `i`, where `i` is the largest index for which the input `r` was `'>'`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `v1` is explicitly initialized to 0.
- The variable `v2` is set to `i`, where `i` is the largest index for which the input `r` was `'>'`. However, since the exact value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific numerical value. We only know that it is the largest index where the input `r` was `'>'`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the following:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`, where `i` is the largest index for which the input `r` was `'>'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 [i] [i] (where [i] is the largest index for which the input r was '>')**
