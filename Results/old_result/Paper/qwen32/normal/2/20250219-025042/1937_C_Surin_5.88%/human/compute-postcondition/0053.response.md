The given code snippet reassigns the variable `n` to the integer value read from the input. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`) remain unchanged.

Since the new value of `n` is read from the input, we denote it as `input_n`. The precondition that `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴ still holds but now `n` specifically holds the value `input_n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴ (specifically `n` is `input_n`), the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1**.
