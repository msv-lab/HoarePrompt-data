The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `prev` to 0. No other variables are modified, and no input or output operations are performed. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, and `v1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is 0.**
