The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (no change needed).
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴ (no change needed).
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} (no change needed).
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions (no change needed).
- `v2` is 4 (no change needed).
- `r` is the string read from the input (no change needed).
- If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 4 (no change needed).

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `i` is 5, `v2` is 4, `r` is the string read from the input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 4**
