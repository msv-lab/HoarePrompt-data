The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a command to flush the output buffer. This command does not affect any of the variables or the state of the program in terms of variable values. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`) are modified by this command.

Given that no changes occur to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `i` is 5, `v2` is 5, `r` is the string read from the input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 4.**
