The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is `i` (which is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`), `v1` now holds the same value as `v2`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string and `r` is equal to `'<'`.**
