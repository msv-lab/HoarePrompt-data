Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `v2` is initialized to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- It includes the values of `v1` and `v2` twice each.
- However, the initial state does not mention `v1`. Therefore, `v1` must have been defined somewhere else in the code that is not provided here.

Since `v1` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. We can only describe the output in terms of `v1` and `v2`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a formatted string starting with a question mark (`?`), followed by the value of `v1` twice, then the value of `v2` twice.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] 1 1 (where v1 is the value of v1 and v2 is 1)**
