The given code snippet only updates the value of the variable `prev`. The variable `prev` is set to the current value of `i`, which is 1.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` remains the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` remains a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
- `I` remains a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
- `R` remains a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
- `g` remains 0.
- `v1` remains the largest index i for which the input `r` was '<'.
- `prev` is now 1 (previously it was 0).
- `kp` remains incremented by 1 for each time `r` was '<'.
- `v2` remains n-1.
- `r` remains the new input string and `r` is still '>'.
- `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which the input `r` was '<', `prev` is 1, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each time `r` was '<', `v2` is n-1, `r` is '>', `i` is 1.**
