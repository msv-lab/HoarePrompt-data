Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-2, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is set to n-2. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged. `v1` is the largest index j for which the input `r` was '<'.**
