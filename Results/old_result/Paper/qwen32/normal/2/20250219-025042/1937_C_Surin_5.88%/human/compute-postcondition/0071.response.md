The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³,
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴,
- the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1},
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers,
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it,
- `g` is 0,
- `v1` is `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0,
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`,
- `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged,
- `v2` is `i`,
- `r` is the newly input string,
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to its new value, which is the current value of `i` plus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the newly input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the newly input string, `i` is 4**. 

(Note: The exact value of `i` would depend on its value at the end of the previous iteration.)
