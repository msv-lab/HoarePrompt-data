Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[x-1]` depending on the condition, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is determined based on the comparison of `l[x-1]` with `a` and `b`, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element and `y` must be less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is set to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y+3]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` becomes `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` becomes `l[x]`.**
