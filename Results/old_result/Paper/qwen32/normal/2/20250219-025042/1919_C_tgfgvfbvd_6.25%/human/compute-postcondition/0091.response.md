Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 2. If `l[2]` is greater than `l[1]`, `b` is the third element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to `b` or the control flow continues.**
