The code snippet assigns the value of `l[y]` to `b`. Given the initial state, `y` is 1, so `b` is updated to the second element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is `l[1]`, `c` is 0, and `y` is 1.**
