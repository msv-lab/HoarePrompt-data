Postcondition: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, and `n` is greater than `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` depending on whether `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` based on whether `a >= l[x]`. Additionally, `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `b` in the respective cases.**
