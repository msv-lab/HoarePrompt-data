Given the initial state where `c` is explicitly assigned the value 2, the `print(c)` statement will directly output the value of `c`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides specific values for several variables: `a = 1`, `b = 9`, `c = 2`, `y = 0`, and `n = 11`.
2. The `print(c)` statement is straightforward and only involves the variable `c`.
3. Since `c` is explicitly set to 2, the `print(c)` statement will output the value 2.

Therefore, the output of the `print(c)` statement is:
Output: **2**
