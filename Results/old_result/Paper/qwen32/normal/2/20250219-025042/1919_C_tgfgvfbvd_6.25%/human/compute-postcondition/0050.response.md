Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we can determine the new state as follows:

- `y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, which means `n` is greater than `y + 1`.
- `x` is defined as `y + 2`.
- The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`.

Since `x` is `y + 2`, and `y + 1 < n`, it implies that `x` (which is `y + 2`) is a valid index for the list `l` because `y + 2` is less than `n`.

Thus, the only change in the state is the introduction of variable `b` which holds the value `l[x]`.

Output State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`; `n` is greater than `y + 1`; `x` is `y + 2`; `b` is `l[y + 2]`.**
