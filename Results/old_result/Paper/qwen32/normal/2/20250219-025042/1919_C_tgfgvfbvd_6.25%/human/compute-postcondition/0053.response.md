The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `b`. Given that `x` is `y + 2`, the value of `b` will be `l[y + 2]`.

The preconditions `y + 1 < n` and `n > y + 1` remain valid. The value of `x` remains `y + 2` as it was not modified by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `b` is `l[y + 2]`**.
