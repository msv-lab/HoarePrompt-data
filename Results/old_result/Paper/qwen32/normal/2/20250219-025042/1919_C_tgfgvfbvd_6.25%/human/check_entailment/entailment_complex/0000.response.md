### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by maintaining two variables (`a` and `b`) that represent the two most recently identified distinct elements in the array. It then iterates through the array to count how many elements are greater than both `a` and `b`. However, this approach does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as defined in the problem statement.

Here's why the code is incorrect:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The problem requires splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The code does not attempt to create any subsequences; instead, it focuses on counting elements that are greater than two specific elements.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The penalty `p(b)` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i+1]`. The code does not calculate this penalty for any subsequence. Instead, it counts elements that are greater than both `a` and `b`, which does not align with the penalty calculation.

3. **Subsequence Formation**: The code does not form subsequences `s` and `t` at all. It only keeps track of two elements (`a` and `b`) and counts elements relative to these two elements, which is insufficient for solving the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

The code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences and calculating their respective penalties.
