In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`. The loop head contains only one variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range function, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. Specifically, `t` should be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the variable `_` since it is not used within the loop and its value is automatically managed by the `range` function. The only relevant state here is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
