Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, and `y` must be less than `n-1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` becomes `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` becomes `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than `a`; otherwise, `a` remains the first element of the list `l`.**
