Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the fifth element of `l` depending on the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or the fifth element of `l` depending on the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. `x` is 4.**
