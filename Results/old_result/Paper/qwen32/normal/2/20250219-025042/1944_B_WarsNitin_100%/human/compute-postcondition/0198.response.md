To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, and `l` remain the same but their specific values are not provided.
- `k` is set to 0.
- `ans1` contains the first `x` elements of `l`.
- `ans2` also contains the first `x` elements of `l`.

The key piece of information here is that `ans1` is a list containing the first `x` elements of another list `l`. Since the exact contents of `l` and the value of `x` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Given this, the output will be the first `x` elements of the list `l`. 

Output: **the first x elements of l (where x is the number of elements taken from the list l to form ans1)**
