The code appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `ans1` initially contains only the last element of `b`, after appending `b[n - 1]` again, `ans1` will contain two identical elements, both being the last element of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is now twice its original value; `req` is equal to `k`; `l` is an empty list because `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
