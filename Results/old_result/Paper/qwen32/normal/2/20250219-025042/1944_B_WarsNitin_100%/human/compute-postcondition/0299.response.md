Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000), an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋), and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
