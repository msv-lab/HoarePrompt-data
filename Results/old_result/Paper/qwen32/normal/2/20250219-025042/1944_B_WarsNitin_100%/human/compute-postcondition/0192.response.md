Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is -2, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2] plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates found in `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must contain at least one element, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or if statement without changing any variable values. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values except that we exit the loop or if statement.
