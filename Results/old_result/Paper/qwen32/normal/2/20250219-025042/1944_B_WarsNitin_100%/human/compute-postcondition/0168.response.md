The code snippet `k -= 2` decreases the value of `k` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `k` can either be 0 or -2. After decrementing by 2, if `k` was initially 0, it becomes -2, and if `k` was initially -2, it becomes -4.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -2 or -4, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2], `ans2` includes `c[i]` and now also includes the new element `c[i]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not the last element in their group, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
