Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is either 0, -2, -4, -6, or `req - 6`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes two occurrences of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and additionally includes `c[3]` if `c[3]` equals `c[2]`. If `c[4]` equals `c[3]`, `ans2` also includes `c[4]`. `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, and `i` is 4.**
