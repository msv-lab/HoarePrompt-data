The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Given that `k` was either 0 or the value of `req`, after the operation, `k` will be either -2 (if `k` was initially 0) or `req - 2` (if `k` was initially `req`). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either -2 or `req - 2`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` now includes two occurrences of `c[i]`, `req` remains the same, and `q` remains the same.**
