Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is twice the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer from the input, `q` is 1. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest element among the first `n` elements of `a`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
