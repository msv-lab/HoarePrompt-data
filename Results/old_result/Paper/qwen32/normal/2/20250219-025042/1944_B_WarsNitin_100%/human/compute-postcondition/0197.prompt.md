Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t remains the same, n remains the same, k is 0 if enough consecutive duplicates were found, a remains the same, b remains the same, c remains the same, ans1 contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in b within the range [1, n-2], ans2 contains pairs of consecutive duplicates found in c up to the point where k becomes 0 or the loop ends, req remains the same, q remains the same, l contains elements from b that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not the last element in their group.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is -1, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2] plus the first element of `l`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates found in `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends plus the first element of `l`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must contain at least one element, `i` is 0. If `k` was 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is -2, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2] plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates found in `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must contain at least one element, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is -3, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2] plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` and now also includes `l[2]`, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicates found in `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends plus the first element of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` and now also includes `l[2]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must contain at least one element, `i` is 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
