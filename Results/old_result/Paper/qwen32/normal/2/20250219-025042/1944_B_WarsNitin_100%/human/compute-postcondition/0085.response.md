The given code snippet appends `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. This means that the list `ans2` will now include `l[i]` as its last element. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` now includes `l[i]` as its last element, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, plus `l[i]` as its last element, `req` equals 0 if `k` was 0, otherwise `req` equals the final value of `k`, and `l` must have at least one element.**
