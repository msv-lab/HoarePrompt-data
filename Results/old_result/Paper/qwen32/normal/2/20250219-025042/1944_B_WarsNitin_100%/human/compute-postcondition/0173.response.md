The code snippet appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. This means that the list `ans2` will now include the element `c[i]` as its new last element. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0, -2, or -4, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2], `ans2` includes `c[i]` and the newly added `c[i]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not the last element in their group, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
