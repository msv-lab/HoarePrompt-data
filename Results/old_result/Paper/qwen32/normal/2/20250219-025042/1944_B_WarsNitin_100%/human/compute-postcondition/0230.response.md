Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` (and possibly the smallest element if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`) plus `b[i]`. If `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` repeated twice, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list. `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer from the input, `q` is 1. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
