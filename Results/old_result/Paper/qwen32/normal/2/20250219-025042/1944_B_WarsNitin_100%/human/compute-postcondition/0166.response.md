Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2], `ans2` includes `c[i]` and now also includes the new element `c[i]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not the last element in their group, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans2` now includes the new element `c[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `ans2`, which has been updated to include the current element `c[i]`.
