The code snippet provided attempts to modify the variable `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. However, the initial state does not include any information about the variable `lex`. Since `lex` is not defined in the initial state, it cannot be modified, and the operation will result in a `NameError`.

Given the instructions, I will assume that there might be a typo or missing information regarding the variable `lex`. Since the task specifies to adhere to the provided initial state and only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, and since no changes can be made due to the undefined variable, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**
