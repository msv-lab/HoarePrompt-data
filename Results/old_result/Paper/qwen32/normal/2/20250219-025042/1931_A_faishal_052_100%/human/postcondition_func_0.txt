The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `lex` (where 3 ≤ lex ≤ 78), and outputs a string of three characters derived from the processed value of `lex`. For each test case, the function calculates a sequence of numbers based on the value of `lex`, sorts them, and then converts the first three numbers of the sorted sequence into lowercase alphabetic characters by adding 96 to each number and converting to ASCII. The resulting strings are printed one per line.
