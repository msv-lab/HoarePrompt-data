The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

Since the loop has just started and `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means this is the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, at the start of the next (second) iteration, `j` should be 1.

The other variables (`info`, `temp`, `i`, `cases`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the character `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`; `j` is 1; `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 3**
