To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `temp` variable based on the `info` list.

The loop iterates over the range of 3, meaning it will execute exactly 3 times. During each iteration, it appends a character to the `temp` string based on the value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Here, `i` is assumed to be a fixed index (likely 0 based on the context) and `j` ranges from 0 to 2.

After 3 iterations, `temp` will contain the characters corresponding to `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96`.

Given the pattern observed in the provided output states, the final output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96`; `j` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the final `temp` string will consist of three characters derived from the first three elements of the array at index `i` in the `info` list, with each element being converted to a character by adding 96 to it. The loop counter `j` will be 2, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
