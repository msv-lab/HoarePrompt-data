Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is `lex - 26` if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 78, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` was initially less than 28, `arr` is [26, 26] if `lex` was initially between 28 and 51, `arr` is [26] if `lex` was initially 52 or more, and `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains unchanged as an empty list.**
