The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, meaning it has already been incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the value it was before the increment, plus one more. Since `i` is currently `i + 1`, we need to set `i` to `(i + 1) + 1` or simply `i + 2` minus 1, which is effectively `i + 1`.

However, since `i` has already been incremented in the previous iteration, we just need to ensure that the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1` from the previous state) is still less than `cases` for the loop to continue.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1 from its current value (`i + 1`), making it `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted as follows: if `lex < 29`, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `29 <= lex < 52`, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex - 27]`; if `52 <= lex < 78`, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex >= 78`, `arr` is `[lex]`.**
