Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` is greater than 0.
- `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `j` is 1.
- `lex` is an input integer.
- Depending on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` is `[26]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[]`.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet is:
```python
arr.append(1)
```

This line appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `arr` will have `1` appended to it, changing its value depending on the initial value of `arr` based on the conditions for `lex`.

### Output State:
- If `lex` was less than 28, `arr` was initially `[1]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]`.
- If `lex` was greater than or equal to 28 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` was initially `[26]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` was greater than 78, `arr` was initially `[]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex` was less than 28, `[26, 1]` if `lex` was between 28 and 78 inclusive, or `[1]` if `lex` was greater than 78.**
