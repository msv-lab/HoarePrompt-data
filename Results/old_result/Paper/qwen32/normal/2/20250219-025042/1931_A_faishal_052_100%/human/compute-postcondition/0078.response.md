The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` has an additional element `26` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
