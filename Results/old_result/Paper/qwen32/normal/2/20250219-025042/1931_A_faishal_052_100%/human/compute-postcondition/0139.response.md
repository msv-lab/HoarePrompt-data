To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`.
2. `temp` is a string constructed from the first three elements of the array at index `i` in `info`. Specifically, it contains the characters corresponding to `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96`.
3. `j` is set to 2.

### Key Points:
- The variable `temp` is constructed based on the values in `info[i]`. 
- The values in `temp` are derived by adding 96 to each of the first three elements of `info[i]` and converting these sums to their corresponding ASCII characters.

### Constructing `temp`:
- `temp` is a string formed by converting the ASCII values obtained from `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96` to characters.
- For example, if `info[i][0]` is 1, then `info[i][0] + 96` equals 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'.
- Similarly, `info[i][1] + 96` and `info[i][2] + 96` would convert to the next two characters.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(temp)
```

### Analysis:
- Since `temp` is constructed based on the values in `info[i]`, and no specific values for `info[i]` are provided, we can only describe `temp` in terms of the elements of `info[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(temp)` statement will output a string `temp` which is constructed by converting the ASCII values obtained from `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96` to characters.

Thus, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **temp (where temp is a string formed by converting the ASCII values of info[i][0] + 96, info[i][1] + 96, and info[i][2] + 96 to characters)**
