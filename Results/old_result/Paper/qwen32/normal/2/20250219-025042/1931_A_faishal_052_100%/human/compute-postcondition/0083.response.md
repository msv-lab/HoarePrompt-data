Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 0
- `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `j` is 2
- Depending on the value of `lex`, `arr` is modified and `lex` is adjusted accordingly:
  - If `lex` is less than 29, `arr` is `[1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 2`.
  - If `lex` is 29 or greater but less than 52, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`.
  - If `lex` is 52 or greater but less than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 52`.
  - If `lex` is 78 or greater, `arr` is `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.

Code Snippet:
```python
arr.append(lex)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `lex` is appended to the list `arr`.

Given the conditions for `lex` and the corresponding initial values of `arr`, let's consider each case:

1. If `lex` was less than 29:
   - Initial `arr`: `[1, 1]`
   - After appending `lex`: `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex - 2]`

2. If `lex` was 29 or greater but less than 52:
   - Initial `arr`: `[26, 1]`
   - After appending `lex`: `arr` becomes `[26, 1, lex - 27]`

3. If `lex` was 52 or greater but less than 78:
   - Initial `arr`: `[26, 26]`
   - After appending `lex`: `arr` becomes `[26, 26, lex - 52]`

4. If `lex` was 78 or greater:
   - Initial `arr`: `[]`
   - After appending `lex`: `arr` becomes `[lex]`

Since `lex` is adjusted before appending, we need to reflect the adjusted value of `lex` in the final `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2, and `arr` is updated as follows:
- If `lex` was originally less than 29, `arr` is now `[1, 1, lex - 2]`
- If `lex` was originally 29 or greater but less than 52, `arr` is now `[26, 1, lex - 27]`
- If `lex` was originally 52 or greater but less than 78, `arr` is now `[26, 26, lex - 52]`
- If `lex` was originally 78 or greater, `arr` is now `[lex]`**
