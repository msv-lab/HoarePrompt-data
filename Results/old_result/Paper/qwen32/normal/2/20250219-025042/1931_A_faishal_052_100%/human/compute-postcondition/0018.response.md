Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 28. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` contains the integer 26. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
