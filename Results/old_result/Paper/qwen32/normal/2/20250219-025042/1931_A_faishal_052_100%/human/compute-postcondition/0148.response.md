The given loop iterates over the range of 3, meaning it will execute exactly 3 times as specified by `for j in range(3):`. The loop appends characters to the `temp` string based on the values in `info[i][j]` where `i` is fixed at 3 and `j` increments from 0 to 2. 

From the provided output states after each iteration, we can see that after 3 iterations, `temp` contains the characters derived from `info[3][0]`, `info[3][1]`, and `info[3][2]`.

Since the loop runs exactly 3 times and no further iterations occur, the final state of the variables will be:

- `info` remains unchanged as a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`.
- `temp` will be a string containing the characters `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`.
- `j` will be 2 (the last value it took in the loop).
- `i` will be 3 (unchanged as per the loop).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2; `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 3.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `temp` will hold the string formed by converting the first three elements of the fourth array in `info` (index 3) to their corresponding ASCII characters by adding 96 to each element. All other variables remain in their initial states except for `j`, which will be 2 due to the last iteration of the loop.
