To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(cases):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0 because `range(cases)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `cases`. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` is an input integer.
- `info` is an empty list.

Since `t` and `n` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The variable `info` is also not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop.

The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list**.
