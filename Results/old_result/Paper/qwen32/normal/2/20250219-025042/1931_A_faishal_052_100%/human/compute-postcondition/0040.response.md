The given loop runs for a fixed number of iterations specified in the loop head (`for j in range(2)`), which means it will execute exactly 2 times, not 3 as mentioned in the problem statement. Let's analyze the loop and derive the final state after these 2 iterations.

### Initial State:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n`: An integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases`: Greater than 0
- `info`: An empty list
- `arr`: An empty list
- `lex`: An input integer

### Loop Execution:
#### Iteration 1 (j=0):
- If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and set `lex = lex - 1`.
- If `28 ≤ lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and set `lex = lex - 26`.
- If `52 ≤ lex ≤ 78`, append `26` to `arr` and set `lex = lex - 26`.

#### Iteration 2 (j=1):
- The same conditions apply as in Iteration 1.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes its 2 iterations, the final state of the variables will be as follows:
- `t`, `n`, `cases`, and `info` remain unchanged.
- `arr` will contain up to two elements based on the value of `lex` at the start of each iteration.
- `lex` will be reduced by a total of up to 52 (if `lex` was initially 78 or less).

### Detailed Analysis:
- If `lex` was initially less than 28:
  - After the first iteration, `lex` becomes `lex - 1` and `arr` contains `[1]`.
  - After the second iteration, `lex` becomes `lex - 2` and `arr` contains `[1, 1]` if `lex - 1` was still less than 28; otherwise, `arr` contains `[1, 26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 27`.
  
- If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51:
  - After the first iteration, `lex` becomes `lex - 26` and `arr` contains `[26]`.
  - After the second iteration, `lex` becomes `lex - 26` again and `arr` contains `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` was still less than 52; otherwise, `arr` remains `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 52`.

- If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78:
  - After the first iteration, `lex` becomes `lex - 26` and `arr` contains `[26]`.
  - After the second iteration, `lex` becomes `lex - 26` again and `arr` contains `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` was still less than or equal to 78; otherwise, `arr` remains `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 52`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` contains up to two elements based on the initial value of `lex`, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `arr` will contain either `[1, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`, or `[26]` depending on the initial value of `lex`, and `lex` will be reduced by a total of up to 52.
