The code appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an input integer less than 28, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is [1]**
