The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the end of the list `arr`. However, the initial state does not mention the existence of `arr`, so we assume `arr` was previously defined and is now updated.

Given the initial state and the code execution, the output state should reflect the changes made to `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 2, `arr` contains the element 26.**
