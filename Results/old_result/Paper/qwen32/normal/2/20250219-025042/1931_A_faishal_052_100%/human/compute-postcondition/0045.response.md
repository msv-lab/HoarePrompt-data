The given code snippet reassigns `arr` to an empty list. This means that the previous contents of `arr` (which contained up to two elements in non-decreasing order) are discarded, and `arr` now holds no elements.

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is still an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` is still greater than 0.
- `info` still contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` (before it was reassigned).
- `lex` is still reduced by up to 52.
- `i` is still `i + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is reduced by up to 52, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is an empty list.**
