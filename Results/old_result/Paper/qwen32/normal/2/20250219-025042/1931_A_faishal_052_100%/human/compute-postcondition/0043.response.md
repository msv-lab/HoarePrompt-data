The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Therefore, `info` now contains its original value plus the new element `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by `arr`, `arr` contains up to two elements in non-decreasing order, and `lex` is reduced by up to 52.**
