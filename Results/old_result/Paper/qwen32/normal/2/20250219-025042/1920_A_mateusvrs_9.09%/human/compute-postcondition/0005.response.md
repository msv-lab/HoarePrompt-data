The code assigns the integer value of `1000000000.0 + 7` to the variable `ax`. Since `1000000000.0 + 7` equals `1000000007.0`, converting it to an integer results in `1000000007`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and `cx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the input integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007**.
