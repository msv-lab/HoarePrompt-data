Postcondition: **`ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` remains 1000000007. `bx` is -1. `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`, and if `a` is not 2, `cx` includes the new value `x`. `r` contains `0` if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` is greater than 0. `a` and `x` are integers read from the input, and `a` is not equal to 1.**
