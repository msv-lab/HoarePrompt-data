The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `bx`, we assume `bx` holds some value before this operation.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `bx`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is incremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`.**
