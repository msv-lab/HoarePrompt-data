Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and must contain at least one element. `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
