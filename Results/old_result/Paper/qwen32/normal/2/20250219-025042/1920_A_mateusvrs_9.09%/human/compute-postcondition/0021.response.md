The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. Since `x` is the second input integer, `ax` will now hold the smaller value between 1000000007 and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer.**
