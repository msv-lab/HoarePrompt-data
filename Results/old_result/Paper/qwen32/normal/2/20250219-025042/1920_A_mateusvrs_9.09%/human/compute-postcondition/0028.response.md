Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 99
- `a` is the first input integer
- `x` is the second input integer
- `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0 if `a` was previously 1
- `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x` if `a` was previously 2, `ax` is 1000000007 otherwise
- `r` is a list containing the single element `x` if `a` was not 1 or 2, `r` remains an empty list otherwise.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
ax = min(x, ax)
```

This line updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios for `ax` based on the initial conditions:

1. If `a` was previously 1, `ax` was set to 1000000007.
2. If `a` was previously 2, `ax` was set to the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.
3. If `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` was also set to 1000000007.

After executing `ax = min(x, ax)`, the new value of `ax` will be:
- If `a` was previously 1, `ax` will now be the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.
- If `a` was previously 2, `ax` will now be the minimum of the previous value of `ax` (which is already the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`) and `x`. This means `ax` will remain unchanged if `x` is greater than or equal to the previous value of `ax`.
- If `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` will now be the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and its previous value, which simplifies to just `min(x, 1000000007)` because `ax` was initially either 1000000007 or a value derived from `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0 if `a` was previously 1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, `r` is a list containing the single element `x` if `a` was not 1 or 2, `r` remains an empty list otherwise.**
