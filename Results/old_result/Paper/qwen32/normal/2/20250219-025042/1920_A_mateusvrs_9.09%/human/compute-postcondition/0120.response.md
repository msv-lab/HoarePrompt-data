Postcondition: **`ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and its previous value depending on whether `a` is not equal to 2. `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`, and if `a` is not 2, `cx` includes the new value `x`. `r` contains `0` if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `a` and `x` are integers read from the input.**
