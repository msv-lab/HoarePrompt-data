The code snippet updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is decremented by 1, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are calculated based on the value of `a` and `x` as described, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`.**
