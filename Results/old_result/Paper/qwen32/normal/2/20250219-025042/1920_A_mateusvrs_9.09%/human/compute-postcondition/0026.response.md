The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This affects the values of `a` and `x` while leaving the other variables (`t`, `n`, `bx`, `ax`, `r`) unchanged unless they depend on `a` or `x`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The values of `bx`, `ax`, and `r` are dependent on the new values of `a` and `x` but are not recalculated in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0 if `a` was previously 1, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x` if `a` was previously 2, `ax` is 1000000007 otherwise, `r` is a list containing the single element `x` if `a` was not 1 or 2, `r` remains an empty list otherwise.**
