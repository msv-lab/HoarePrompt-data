To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the set `cx` and modifies `tmp`. The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx` and increments `tmp` if `i` lies within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Let's break down the final state step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Conditions**:
   - `ax`: Minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, or `1000000007` if no such `x` was encountered.
   - `bx`: Maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, or `-1` if no such `x` was encountered.
   - `cx`: Set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a == 3`.
   - `r`: List that may contain elements `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx < ax`.
   - `t`: Decrement by `n` (total number of iterations).
   - `n`: Total number of iterations performed.
   - `bx < ax`.
   - `tmp` starts at `0`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` in `cx`, if `i` is within `[bx, ax]`, `tmp` is incremented by `1`.

3. **Final State Calculation**:
   - After all iterations, `tmp` will be equal to the count of elements in `cx` that lie within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
   - `tmp` is the only variable that changes based on the contents of `cx` and the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Output State
The final output state will reflect the final value of `tmp` after all iterations of the loop.

**Output State:** **`ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a == 2`, or `1000000007` if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a == 1`, or `-1` if no such `x` was encountered; `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a == 3`; `r` is a list that may contain elements `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx < ax`; `t` is decremented by `n` (the total number of iterations); `n` is the number of iterations performed; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that lie within the range `[bx, ax]`.** 

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `tmp` will hold the number of unique `x` values in `cx` that fall between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. All other variables remain in their initial states except for `tmp`.
