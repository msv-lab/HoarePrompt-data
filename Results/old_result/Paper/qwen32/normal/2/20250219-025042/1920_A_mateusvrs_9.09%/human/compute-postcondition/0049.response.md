Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing the single element `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing one element `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**
