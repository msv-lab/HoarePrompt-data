The code snippet updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Given that `ax` was not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it holds some value prior to this line of code. After executing the line, `ax` will hold the minimum value between its previous value and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is incremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax` is the minimum of its previous value and `x`.**
