Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is decremented by 1, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are calculated based on the value of `a` and `x` as described.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ax` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
