Postcondition: **`ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a == 2`, or `1000000007` if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a == 1`, or `-1` if no such `x` was encountered; `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a == 3` and must contain at least one element; `r` is a list that may contain elements `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx < ax`; `t` is decremented by `n` (the total number of iterations); `n` is the number of iterations performed; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is `0`; `i` is a value such that `bx <= i <= ax`.**
