To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` evolve with each iteration based on the input values `a` and `x`.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `ax` starts as `1000000007`.
  - `bx` starts as `-1`.
  - `cx` starts as an empty set.

- **Loop Iteration Rules:**
  - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
  - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
  - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx`.

### Final Output State:
After all `n` iterations, the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` will be determined as follows:
- `ax` will hold the smallest value encountered when `a == 2`.
- `bx` will hold the largest value encountered when `a == 1`.
- `cx` will contain all unique values encountered when `a == 3`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- `ax` will be the smallest number provided with command `2`.
- `bx` will be the largest number provided with command `1`.
- `cx` will be a set of all unique numbers provided with command `3`.

### Output State Format:
Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`.**

This format ensures that the output state reflects the cumulative effect of all loop iterations on the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx`.
