Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and must contain at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is `i_next` where `i_next` is another element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet, and `tmp` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1.**
