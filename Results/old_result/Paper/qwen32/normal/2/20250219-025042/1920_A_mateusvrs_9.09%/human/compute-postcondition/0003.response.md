The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to the variable `n` based on user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. After executing the code, the value of `n` changes to whatever integer is provided by the user input, but it still adheres to the condition that `n` must be between 2 and 100 inclusive. The other variables (`t` and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the input integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list**.
