Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of two binary strings, followed by the two binary strings themselves. It then evaluates these strings and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the binary strings meet certain criteria (which are not detailed here), it returns a specific output; otherwise, it returns a different output. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the total length of all binary strings combined not exceeding 2 â‹… 10^5.**
