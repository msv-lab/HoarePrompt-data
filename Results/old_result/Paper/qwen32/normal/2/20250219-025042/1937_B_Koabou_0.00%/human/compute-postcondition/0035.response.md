The value of `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`. Given the initial state, `x` is `n - 1` and `i` is `i + 1`. Substituting these into the equation, we get `t = (n - 1) - (i + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `t = n - i - 1`.

The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the substrings of `a[0]` and `s` does not affect the calculation of `t` in this step.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is `n - i - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - 1`**.
