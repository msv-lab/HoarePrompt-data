To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only assume that `func_1()` might modify some variables or perform certain operations. However, based on the given initial state and the fact that no specific changes to `numero_testes` are mentioned in the code snippet, we can infer that `numero_testes` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within `func_1()`. 

Given that the function `func_1()` is called but its implementation details are unknown, we cannot definitively state any changes to `numero_testes` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the same conditions as the initial state unless additional information about `func_1()` is provided.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0**.
