The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments the value of `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - k + 1`, the value of `soma_b` will now include the element at index `n - k + 1` of `lista_B`.

Therefore, the updated `soma_b` will be the original `soma_b` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `i` is `n - k + 1`.**
