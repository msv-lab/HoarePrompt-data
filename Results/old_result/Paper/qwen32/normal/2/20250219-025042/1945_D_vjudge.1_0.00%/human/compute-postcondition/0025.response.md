The code increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `i` now points to the next element in `lista_B`. The values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and the new value of `i` remain unchanged. The only change is in `soma_b`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`; `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`; `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input; `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `soma_b` is `soma_b` + `lista_B[i]`.**
