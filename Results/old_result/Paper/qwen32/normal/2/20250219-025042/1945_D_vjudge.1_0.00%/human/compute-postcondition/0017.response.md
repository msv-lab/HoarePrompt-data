The code snippet `pref += lista_A[i]` increments the variable `pref` by the value of `lista_A[i]`. This means that the new value of `pref` is the sum of its previous value and the element at index `i` in the list `lista_A`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`.
- `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input.
- `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `pref` is increased by `soma_b`.

After executing the code snippet, the only change is in the value of `pref`, which now includes the addition of `lista_A[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`; `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`; `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input; `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `pref` is increased by `soma_b` and then further increased by `lista_A[i]`.**
