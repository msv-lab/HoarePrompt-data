In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `numero_testes`, as the underscore `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times.

For the loop to execute, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0. The state of `numero_testes` being an integer read from the input is already provided, but we need to ensure that this integer is greater than 0 to allow the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0**
