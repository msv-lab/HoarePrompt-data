### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic and correctness of the provided functions based on the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue.
- **Approach**:
  1. **Reverse Input Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This means that the last element in the original list becomes the first in the reversed list, and so on.
  2. **Initialize Variables**: `soma_b` (sum of `b` values) and `pref` (prefix sum of costs) are initialized to 0.
  3. **Iterate Over First `n-k` Elements**:
     - For each element in the first `n-k` elements of the reversed list:
       - If the current `a_i` is less than the corresponding `b_i`, it adds the accumulated `soma_b` to `pref`, adds `a_i` to `pref`, and resets `soma_b` to 0.
       - Otherwise, it adds `b_i` to `soma_b`.
  4. **Determine Minimum Cost for Last `k` Elements**:
     - It initializes `resultado` to infinity.
     - For each element in the last `k` elements of the reversed list, it updates `resultado` to be the minimum of the current `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`, and then adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
  5. **Print Result**: Finally, it prints the `resultado`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
- **Approach**:
  1. **Read Number of Test Cases**: It reads the number of test cases.
  2. **Process Each Test Case**: For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to compute and print the result.

#### Analysis:
- **Reversing Lists**: Reversing the lists seems to be a strategy to simplify the logic, but it doesn't inherently change the problem's requirements. The logic within `func_1` needs to correctly handle the reversed lists to ensure the calculations are accurate.
- **Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the prefix sums and determining the minimum cost seems to follow the problem's requirements. It correctly handles the conditions where Kirill can swap positions and the costs associated with passing people during swaps.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the functions seem to correctly implement the solution. The reversing of the lists appears to be a strategic choice that simplifies the iteration logic without altering the problem's core requirements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
