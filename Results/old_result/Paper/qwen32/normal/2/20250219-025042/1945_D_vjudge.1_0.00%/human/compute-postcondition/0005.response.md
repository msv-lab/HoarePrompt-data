In this case, the loop head contains the variable `_` and `numero_testes`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times (`numero_testes`), it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will continue to execute as long as the range generated by `numero_testes` has more elements.

At the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` remains unchanged because it determines the total number of iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be greater than 0, and the internal counter of the loop (which is represented by `_`) should be incremented by 1.

Since the problem specifies that we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and `_` is not something we can directly control or observe, the only relevant adjustment is confirming that `numero_testes` remains greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0**
