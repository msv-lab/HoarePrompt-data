The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` adds the element at index `i` of `lista_B` to the current value of `soma_b`. 

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` maintain their conditions (`n` is greater than `k` and `k` is less than `n`). `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain as reversed lists of integers read from the input. The variable `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code executes.

The only change is in the value of `soma_b`, which now includes the addition of `lista_B[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `soma_b` is updated to `soma_b + lista_B[i]`.**
