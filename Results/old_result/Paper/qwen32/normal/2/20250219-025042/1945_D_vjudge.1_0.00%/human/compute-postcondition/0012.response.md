Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is 0, and `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`**
