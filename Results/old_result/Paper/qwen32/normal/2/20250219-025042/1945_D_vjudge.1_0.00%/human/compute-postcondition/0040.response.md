Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), `k` (an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill such that 1 <= k <= n), `lista_A` (a list of n integers where each element represents the cost for Kirill to swap positions with the i-th person), and `lista_B` (a list of n integers where each element represents the cost for Kirill to pass the i-th person during a swap). The function returns the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach a position no greater than `k` in the queue.**
