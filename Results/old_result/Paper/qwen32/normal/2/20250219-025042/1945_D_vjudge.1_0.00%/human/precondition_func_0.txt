n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, and k is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill such that 1 <= k <= n. lista_A is a list of n integers where each element represents the cost a_i for Kirill to swap positions with the i-th person. lista_B is a list of n integers where each element represents the cost b_i for Kirill to pass the i-th person during a swap. Both lista_A and lista_B contain positive integers.
