Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`; `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`; `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input; `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `soma_b` is 0; `pref` is the sum of its previous value and `lista_A[i]`.**

In simple terms: The value of `pref` is now the sum of its previous value and the element at index `i` of `lista_A`. All other variables remain unchanged.
