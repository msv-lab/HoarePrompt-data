Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`; `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`; `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input; `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is the sum of its previous value and `lista_A[i]`; otherwise, `soma_b` is `soma_b` + `lista_B[i]`.**
