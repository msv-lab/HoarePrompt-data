Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of:
- An integer `n` representing the number of pairs of integers.
- A list of `2n` integers.

The goal is to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

### Program Logic

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case:
     - The integer `n` is read.
     - The list of `2n` integers is read and split into a list of strings.
     - The list is sorted in ascending order.
     - A variable `suma` is initialized to zero to keep track of the score.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - While there are still elements in the list:
     - The smallest element `a` is popped from the front of the list.
     - The next smallest element `b` is popped from the front of the list.
     - The minimum of `a` and `b` is added to `suma`.

3. **Output:**
   - The final score `suma` is printed for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

The program correctly implements the strategy of always pairing the smallest available integers to maximize the score. Here's why:

- **Sorting:** By sorting the list in ascending order, the smallest integers are always at the beginning of the list.
- **Pairing Strategy:** By popping the smallest two integers in each iteration, the program ensures that the minimum of each pair is added to the score, which is optimal.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the minimum and maximum constraints given in the problem description:
  - `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`
  - `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`
  - `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic for all valid inputs within the given constraints. It handles the sorting and pairing strategy optimally to achieve the maximum score.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order and pairs the smallest integers together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is added to the score. This strategy is optimal for maximizing the score, and the program handles all edge cases within the given constraints.
