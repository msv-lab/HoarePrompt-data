The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which was previously described as `t` in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**
