### Reasoning:
To solve this problem optimally, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values chosen in each pair of integers selected from the list. The strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of integers in non-decreasing order and then repeatedly pick pairs of consecutive elements. This ensures that the smaller element in each pair is added to the score, which is optimal because it maximizes the contribution of smaller numbers to the score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Details:** For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`numInteger`), which is `n`, and then reads the `2n` integers.
3. **Sorting:** The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.
4. **Pairing and Summing:** The program uses a while loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, adds this value to the score (`suma`), and continues until the list is empty.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the computed score for each test case.

This approach aligns perfectly with the optimal strategy described above. By sorting the numbers and always picking the smallest available numbers in pairs, the program ensures that the score is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the optimal solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
