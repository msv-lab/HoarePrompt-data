To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `i < w`.

Given the current state:
- `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x).
- `w` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 3.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `w`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must still be less than `w`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is currently 3.
- The variable `w` is greater than 2.

Since `w` is greater than 2, it could be any value greater than 2. To ensure that `i < w` holds true, `w` must be greater than 3 (since `i` is currently 3).

### Conclusion:
To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `w` to be greater than 3. No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` must be greater than 3; `i` is 3.**
