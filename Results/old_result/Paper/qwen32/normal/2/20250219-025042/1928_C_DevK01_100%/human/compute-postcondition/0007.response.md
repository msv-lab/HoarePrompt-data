It seems there is a small mistake in the if condition provided. The condition `(q % i == 0)` suggests that `q` is being used as an integer, but according to the precondition, `q` is a list of tuples. It's likely that the intention was to check a specific element or property of `q` that is an integer. However, since the exact intended condition isn't clear, I'll assume the condition is meant to check if the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0, which is a common operation when dealing with lists.

Given this assumption, here is the postcondition:

Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. `w` is greater than 1. `i` is 1. The length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the additional condition derived from the if statement.
