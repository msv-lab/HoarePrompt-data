### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) during the settling process satisfy the rules described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Settling Process:**
   - The sequence of numbers assigned to students repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Within each segment of \( 2k - 2 \) positions, the first \( k \) positions are numbered \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), and the next \( k-2 \) positions are numbered \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For Vasya to receive number \( x \) at position \( n \), \( x \) must be within the range \( 1 \) to \( k \) or \( k-1 \) to \( 2 \).
   - The position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) determines the position within the repeating segment.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - Given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find \( k \) such that:
     - \( n \mod (2k - 2) \) falls within the range corresponding to \( x \).
     - Specifically, \( n \mod (2k - 2) \) should be either \( x \) or \( 2k - x \) (if \( x \neq k \)).

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even. If not, it prints \( 0 \) because \( 2k - 2 \) must be even.
   - It then calls `func_1` to find potential values of \( k \) based on the divisors of \( (y - 2) / 2 \) and possibly \( (n - x) / 2 \) if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \).
   - `func_1` finds divisors of a given number that are at least \( x - 1 \).

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies the condition that \( y = n + x \) must be even.
   - The use of divisors in `func_1` helps in finding potential values of \( k \) by ensuring that \( 2k - 2 \) divides some relevant quantity.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation. The program does not correctly account for all possible values of \( k \) that could satisfy the conditions. Specifically, it does not handle the case where \( n \mod (2k - 2) \) could be \( 2k - x \) directly.

### Conclusion:

While the program has the right idea of using divisors and checking conditions, it does not fully cover all possible values of \( k \) that could satisfy the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**
