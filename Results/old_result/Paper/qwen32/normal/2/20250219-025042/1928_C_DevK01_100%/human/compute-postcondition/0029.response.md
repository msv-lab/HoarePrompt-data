The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 3, so after the increment, `i` becomes 4. The other variables (`q`, `w`, and `M`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` is greater than 3; `i` is 4. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, `M` includes the values of `x // i` for those tuples. Otherwise, `M` is not updated with any new values from `q`.**
