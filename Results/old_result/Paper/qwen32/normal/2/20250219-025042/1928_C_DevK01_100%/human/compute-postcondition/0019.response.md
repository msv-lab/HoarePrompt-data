The provided code snippet contains an error because `q` is a list of tuples, and you cannot perform integer division (`//`) on a list directly. However, assuming the intention was to perform integer division on one of the elements of the tuples within the list, let's proceed with the assumption that the operation is intended to be performed on the first element `n` of each tuple in `q`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, here's the output state:

Initial State: `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` has had `2` appended to it.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
M += [q // i]
```

Since `q` is a list of tuples, the correct approach would involve iterating over `q` and performing the operation on each tuple. However, since the code snippet provided does not include such iteration, let's assume the intention was to perform the operation on the first tuple in the list `q`.

Let's denote the first tuple in `q` as `(n1, x1)`. The code would then be interpreted as:
```python
M += [n1 // i]
```

Given `i` is 2, the operation becomes:
```python
M += [n1 // 2]
```

Therefore, the value of `M` will be updated by appending the integer division of `n1` by 2.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` has had `2` appended to it; `M` has an additional element which is the integer division of the first element of the first tuple in `q` by 2.**

In natural language: The list `M` now includes an additional element, which is the result of dividing the first element of the first tuple in `q` by 2 using integer division. All other variables remain unchanged.
