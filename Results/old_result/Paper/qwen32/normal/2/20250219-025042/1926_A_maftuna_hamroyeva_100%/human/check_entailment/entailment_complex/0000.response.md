### Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of the given test case strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each of these `t` test cases, it reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - Two counters, `l` and `h`, are initialized to zero for each test case.
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `a`.
     - If the character is 'A', it increments the counter `l`.
     - Otherwise, it increments the counter `h`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, the program compares the values of `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - Since the problem guarantees that all test case strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', the program handles these constraints correctly.
   - The program also correctly resets the counters `l` and `h` for each new test case.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the comparison of `l` and `h`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality and produces the expected output for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
