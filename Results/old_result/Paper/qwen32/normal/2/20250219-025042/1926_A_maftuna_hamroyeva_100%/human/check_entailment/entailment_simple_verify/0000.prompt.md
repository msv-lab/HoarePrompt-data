You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', counts the occurrences of 'A' (`l`) and other characters (`h`), and prints 'A' if `l` is greater than `h`, otherwise it prints 'B'. The variables `l` and `h` are reset for each iteration, and `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem description, we need to output the character that appears most frequently. However, if the counts are equal, the program will always output 'B', which is incorrect because the problem does not specify a tie-breaking rule and both 'A' and 'B' should be valid outputs in such a scenario.

For example, consider the input string "AABBB" and "ABBBA":
- For "AABBB", the program correctly outputs 'B'.
- For "ABBBA", the program incorrectly outputs 'B' instead of 'A' since both 'A' and 'B' appear 3 times each.

To fix this, the program should include a tie-breaking rule or handle the equality case appropriately. One possible solution is to modify the comparison to handle ties by checking if `l == h` and deciding based on a predefined rule, such as choosing 'A' in case of a tie.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif h > l:
            print('B')
        else:
            # Handle tie case, e.g., choose 'A' if counts are equal
            print('A')

# This version ensures that in case of a tie, 'A' is chosen.
```

However, since the original program does not handle the tie case correctly, the Correctness is **False**.
