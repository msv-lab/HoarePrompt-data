Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at position `i` in `a`. If `j` equals 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0 if the previous `j` was 'A', otherwise `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. If `j` does not equal 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1 if the previous `j` was 'A', otherwise `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
