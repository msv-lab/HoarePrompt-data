The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which was already specified in the initial state to be between 1 and 32 inclusive. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 32), and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.**
