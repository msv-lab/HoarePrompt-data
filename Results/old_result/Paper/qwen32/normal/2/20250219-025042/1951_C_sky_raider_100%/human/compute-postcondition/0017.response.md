The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is `2 * s`; `n` must be greater than 1; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` now being `k - 2 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - s`; `c` is `s * (2 * l[i] + t)`; `i` is 2**
