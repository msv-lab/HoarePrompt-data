The code snippet `k -= s` decreases the value of `k` by the value of `s`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`
- `t` is `t + s`

After executing `k -= s`, the value of `k` is reduced by `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`, `k` is `k - s`**
