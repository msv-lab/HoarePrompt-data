The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `c`, `i`, `n`, `m`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is `n * s_final`, `c` is `s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
