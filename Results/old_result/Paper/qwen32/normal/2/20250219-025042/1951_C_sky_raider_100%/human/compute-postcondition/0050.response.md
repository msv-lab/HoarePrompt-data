The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. This means `l` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Since the code does not modify `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `c`, or `i`, these variables retain their initial values. The only change is that `l` is updated to contain the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `t` will be the cumulative sum of `s` over all iterations, `c` will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` over all iterations, `k` will be reduced by the cumulative sum of `s` over all iterations, `i` will be `n`, `m`, `n`, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
