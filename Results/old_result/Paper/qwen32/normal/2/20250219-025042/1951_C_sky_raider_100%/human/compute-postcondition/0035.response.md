The code snippet `k -= s` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `s` from it. Given that `s` is defined as `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(m, k)`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `t` remains `min(m, k)`.
- `c` remains `s * l[i]`.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `k` is updated to `k - min(m, k)`.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains `min(m, k)`.

Given these points, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `s * l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
