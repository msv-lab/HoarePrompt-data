To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k)`
- `c` is `2 * s * l[i] + s * t`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `m` is unchanged
- `k` is `k - min(m, k)`
- `l` is unchanged
- `s` is `min(m, k)`

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect this in the state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Adjust `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, which is `i + 1`.

2. **Check `n`:** The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute again.

No other variables in the loop head (`i` and `n`) need adjustment based on the given loop statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k)`, `c` is `2 * s * l[i] + s * t`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k)`**

However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the final adjusted state focusing only on `i` and `n` is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

But to fully represent the state as per the given information:
State: **`t` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k)`, `c` is `2 * s * l[i] + s * t`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k)`**

Since the task specifies to only adjust the objects in the loop head, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
