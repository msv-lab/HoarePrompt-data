The code snippet provided increments the variable `t` by the value of `s`. No other variables are modified directly by this line of code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the new value of `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`

After executing `t += s`, the value of `t` becomes `t + s`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + t)`, `t` is `t + s`**.
