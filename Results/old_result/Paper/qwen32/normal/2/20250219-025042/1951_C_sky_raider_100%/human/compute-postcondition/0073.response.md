Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions are met, it performs some computation based on `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a`, and returns a computed value. If the conditions are not met, it handles the scenario accordingly.**
