The code sorts the list `l`. The values of `t`, `c`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `l` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is `n * s_final`, `c` is `s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
