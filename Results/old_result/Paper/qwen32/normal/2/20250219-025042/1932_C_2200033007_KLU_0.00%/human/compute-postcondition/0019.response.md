The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged in terms of their described properties. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `b` now includes `a[l-1]` as its last element, `l` is incremented by 1.**
