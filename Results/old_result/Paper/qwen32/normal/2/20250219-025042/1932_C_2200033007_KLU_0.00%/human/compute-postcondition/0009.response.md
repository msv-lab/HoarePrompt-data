The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `s[i]`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Since `r` is decremented, it no longer includes `a[r]` as its last element, but the state of `b` remains as it was described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s[i]` is not equal to 'L', `b` now includes `a[r+1]` as its last element, `r` is decreased by 1.**
