### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Building List `b`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and appends either the leftmost (`a[l]`) or the rightmost (`a[r]`) element of `a` to the list `b` based on whether the current command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - After this loop, `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order they were removed according to the commands.

3. **Calculating Cumulative Product:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `ans` and a variable `p` to 1.
   - It then iterates over the list `b` in reverse order, updating `p` by multiplying it with each element of `b`.
   - It appends the updated `p` to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `ans` in reverse order.

#### Issues in the Code:

- **Cumulative Product Calculation:**
  - The code calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order but does not take the modulo `m` at each step.
  - According to the problem statement, the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` should be taken modulo `m` at each step before appending to `ans`.

- **Incorrect Output:**
  - The current implementation does not correctly compute the required remainders, leading to incorrect results.

#### Correct Implementation:

To fix the code, we need to ensure that we take the modulo `m` at each step when calculating the cumulative product.

Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the original code, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
