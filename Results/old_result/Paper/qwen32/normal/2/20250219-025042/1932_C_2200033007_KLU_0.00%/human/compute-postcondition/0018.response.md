The given code snippet appends the element at index `l` of list `a` to list `b`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `l` are not specified, we can only describe the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `b` now includes `a[l]` as its last element.**
