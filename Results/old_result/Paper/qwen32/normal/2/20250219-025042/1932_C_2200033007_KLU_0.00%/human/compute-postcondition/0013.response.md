The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged except for `l`. Since `l` is incremented, the next time `a[l]` is accessed, it will refer to the next element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` has an additional element which is `a[l]` appended to it, `l` is incremented by 1.**
