The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i_prev + 1`. The condition `n` being greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged unless `i` reaches `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
