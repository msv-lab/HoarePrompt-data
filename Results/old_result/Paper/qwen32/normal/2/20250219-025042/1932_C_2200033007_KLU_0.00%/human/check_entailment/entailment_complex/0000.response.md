### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Order of Operations**: The program first constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. However, the problem requires us to compute the product of all remaining elements of `a` before removing any elements, not just the selected ones.

2. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the end to the start, which does not correspond to the product of all remaining elements in `a` as required by the problem.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The program does not perform the modulo operation `m` on the product of the elements as specified in the problem statement.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Compute the product of all elements in `a` initially.
- For each command, output the current product modulo `m`, then update the product by removing the appropriate element (`a[l]` for 'L' and `a[r]` for 'R').

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    
    for cmd in s:
        ans.append(product)
        if cmd == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[l] using modular inverse
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[r] using modular inverse
            r -= 1
    
    return ans
```

### Correctness: **False**
