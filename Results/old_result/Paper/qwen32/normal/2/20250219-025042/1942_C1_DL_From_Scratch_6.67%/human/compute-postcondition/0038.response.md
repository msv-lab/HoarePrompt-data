Postcondition: **`T` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input such that x ≥ 2, `y` is the third integer read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`, `count` is 2 if the original `num` was 1, otherwise `count` is 1, `i` is 1`.**
