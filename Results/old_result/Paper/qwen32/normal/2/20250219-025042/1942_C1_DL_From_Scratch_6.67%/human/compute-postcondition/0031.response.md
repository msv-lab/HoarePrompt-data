Output State: **`T` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input such that x ≥ 2, `y` is the third integer read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers, `num` is `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**.

Natural Language: The value of `num` has been updated to be the difference between the second element and the first element of `list0`, minus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
