Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `x` is an integer read from the input such that x > 1
- `y` is the third integer read from the input
- `list0` is a sorted list of x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n
- `count` is 1 if `num` equals 1, otherwise `count` remains 0
- `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`
- `i` is 4

Code Snippet:
```python
num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `num` is reassigned to the value of `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.

Output State:
- All other variables remain unchanged except for `num`.
- `num` is now equal to `list0[5] - list0[4] - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer read from the input such that x > 1, `y` is the third integer read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n, `count` is 1 if `num` equals 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, `num` is `list0[5] - list0[4] - 1`, `i` is 4**
