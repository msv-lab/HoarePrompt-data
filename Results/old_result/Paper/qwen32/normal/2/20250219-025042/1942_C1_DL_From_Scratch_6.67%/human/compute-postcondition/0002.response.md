The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state, the values of `n` and `x` are already defined, but `y` is initially set to 0. After executing the code, `y` will be overwritten with the third integer read from the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input, `y` is the third integer read from the input; there are x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n. The sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
