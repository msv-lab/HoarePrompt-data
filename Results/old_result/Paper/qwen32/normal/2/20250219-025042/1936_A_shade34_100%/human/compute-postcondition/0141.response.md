Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` contains at least two elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `mak` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is `i + 1` from the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
