Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, and `pans` is `[0, 1]` if `s` is `'<'`, `[n - 1, 0, 1]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is `[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `pans` is updated by appending `i` (which is 1) to the existing list. All other variables remain unchanged.
