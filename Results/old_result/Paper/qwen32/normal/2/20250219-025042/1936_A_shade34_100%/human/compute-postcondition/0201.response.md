To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Unchanged (not used in the print statement).
2. **`n`**: Unchanged (used to set `i` to `n-1`).
3. **`mak2`**: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists). This value is not directly used in the print statement.
4. **`mak`**: Set to 0.
5. **`pans`**: A list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.
6. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

- **`pans[mak]`**: Since `mak` is 0, this refers to the first element of the `pans` list.
- **`pans[i]`**: Since `i` is `n-1`, this refers to the element at index `n-1` of the `pans` list.

### Determining the Values:
- **`pans[mak]`**: Given `mak` is 0, this is `pans[0]`, which is the first index in `pans` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='`.
- **`pans[i]`**: Given `i` is `n-1`, this is `pans[n-1]`, which is the last index in `pans` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output:
- A literal `'?'`.
- The first element of `pans` (which is `pans[0]`).
- The first element of `pans` again (which is `pans[0]`).
- The last element of `pans` (which is `pans[n-1]`).
- The last element of `pans` again (which is `pans[n-1]`).

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the first index in pans where the input was either '<' or '=', and pans[n-1] is the last index in pans where the input was either '<' or '=')**
