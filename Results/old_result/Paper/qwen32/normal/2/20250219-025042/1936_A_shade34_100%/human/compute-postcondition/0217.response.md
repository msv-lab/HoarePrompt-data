To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` and `n` are mentioned but their values are not specified, so they do not affect the `print` statement directly.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'>'` during the loop iterations.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='`.
- `i` is set to `len(pans) - 1`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

Let's analyze the components:
- `'!'` is a literal string that will be printed.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `pans[mak]` refers to the element in the list `pans` at the index `mak`. Since `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'>'`, this means `pans[mak]` will be the index of the last occurrence of `'>'` in the input sequence.

Given these details, the output will be:
- `'!'` followed by the value of `mak2` (the highest index of `'<'` or 0 if none exist).
- Followed by the value of `pans[mak]` (the index of the last occurrence of `'>'`).

Thus, the final output is described as:
Output: **! [mak2] [pans[mak]] (where mak2 is the highest index of '<' or 0 if none exist, and pans[mak] is the index of the last occurrence of '>')**
