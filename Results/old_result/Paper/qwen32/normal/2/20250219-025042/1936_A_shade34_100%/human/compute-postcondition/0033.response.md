Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0; `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` is equal to `<`, then `mak` is equal to `i` and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is not equal to `<`, then `pans` has `i` appended to it if `s` is equal to '=', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged.**
