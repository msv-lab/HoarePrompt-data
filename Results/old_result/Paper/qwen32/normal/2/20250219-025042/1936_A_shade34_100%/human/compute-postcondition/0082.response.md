To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, and `mak` is either 0 or `i` depending on whether the input is not '<' or is '<', respectively.
- The loop statement is: `for i in range(1, n):`

In each iteration, the variable `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value `k` (where `1 <= k < n`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`.

Since `n` is given to be greater than 1 and does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` is unchanged,
- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged),
- `mak2` is unchanged,
- `pans` is unchanged,
- `mak` is either 0 or `i` depending on the condition (unchanged),
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll represent it as `i + 1` where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is either 0 or `i` depending on whether the input is not '<' or is '<', respectively, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is either 0 or `i` depending on whether the input is not '<' or is '<', respectively, and `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we are only concerned with adjusting the loop head variables, the final state can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is either 0 or `i` depending on whether the input is not '<' or is '<', respectively, and `i` is incremented by 1**.
