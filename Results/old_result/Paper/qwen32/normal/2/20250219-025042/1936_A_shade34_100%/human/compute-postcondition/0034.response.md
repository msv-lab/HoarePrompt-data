The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken on some value (let's denote this value as `i_end`), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i_end + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than `i_end + 1`.

Since the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration isn't provided, we'll denote it as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` should remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`**
