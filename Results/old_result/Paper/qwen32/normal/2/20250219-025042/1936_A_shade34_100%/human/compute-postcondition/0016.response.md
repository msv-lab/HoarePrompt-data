The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Since none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) are modified by this line of code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 3, `n` is `t`, `i` is 4**.
