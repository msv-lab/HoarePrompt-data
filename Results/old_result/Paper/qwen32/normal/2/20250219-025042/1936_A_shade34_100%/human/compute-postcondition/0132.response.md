Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` contains at least two elements. If the current input is '>', then `mak` is set to `i`, where `i` is the index of the current input. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
