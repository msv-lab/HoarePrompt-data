To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is mentioned as "unchanged", but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mak2` is defined as the largest `i` (where 1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was `<`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `pans` is an empty list, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `mak` is defined similarly to `mak2` as the largest `i` (where 1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was `<`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown from the given information.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

We know that `mak` and `mak2` are the same based on their definitions. Therefore, `mak2` appears twice in the print statement.

Let's break down the output:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is the largest `i` (where 1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was `<`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `i` is undefined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.

Since `i` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific value for it. However, we can describe the output in terms of the known values and the unknown value.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak] (where mak is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, and i is an undefined variable)**
