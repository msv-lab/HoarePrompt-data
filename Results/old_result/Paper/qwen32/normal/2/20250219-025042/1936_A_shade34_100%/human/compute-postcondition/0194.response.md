The code snippet assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. Given that `i` is 1, `pans` will now be `[1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is `[1]`.**
