The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pans`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, or `mak2`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is `t`, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `pans` is an empty list.**
