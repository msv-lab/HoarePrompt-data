To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and the range it iterates over (`range(1, len(pans))`). 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak` is `n-1` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is `n-1`.

The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `len(pans)`. Since `i` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, which is `n`.

However, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be less than `len(pans)`. Therefore, `len(pans)` must be at least `n+1`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Increment `i` from `n-1` to `n`.
- Ensure `len(pans)` is at least `n+1` to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is `n-1` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`**
