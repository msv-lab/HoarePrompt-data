The code sets the variable `mak` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, or `pans`. 

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `mak` is 0, `pans` contains all indices i where the input was '=', and the last index i where the input was '<' if it exists.**
