To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is mentioned as "unchanged," but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- `n` is mentioned as "must be greater than 1," but it is also not used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- `mak2` is mentioned as "unchanged," but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- `pans` is mentioned as "unchanged," but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
- `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `i` is used twice in the `print` statement, but its value is not provided in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined or given any specific value, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will represent it as `i`.

Given this analysis, the `print` statement will output the literal character `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is 0), followed by the value of `mak` again (which is 0), followed by the value of `i`, and finally the value of `i` again.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
