The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously some value `x`, it is now `x + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is greater than 1, and `i` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still less than `n`.

Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `x + 1`. For the loop to continue, `x + 1` must be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is either equal to the original value of `i` or the new value of `i` depending on whether the input is not '<' or is '<', respectively, and `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `x + 1` where `x + 1 < n`**.

To simplify and adhere strictly to the format requested:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
