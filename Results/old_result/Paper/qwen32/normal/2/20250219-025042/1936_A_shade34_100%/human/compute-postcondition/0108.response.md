Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `s` is the input string (its value is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `pans` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a string starting with '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
- Since `mak` and `mak2` are described as being the same (both are the largest `i` for which the input was '<'), they will have the same value.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so its value will be one more than its previous value.

### Output Description:
- `?`: A literal question mark character.
- `mak`: The largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `mak2`: Same as `mak` because both variables are described as having the same value.
- `i`: The current value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.
- `mak2`: Again, same as `mak`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak] (where mak is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, and i is the current value of i after being incremented by 1)**
