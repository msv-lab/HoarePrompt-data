To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: Unchanged, but its value is not specified.
   - `n`: Unchanged, but its value is not specified.
   - `mak2`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
   - `mak`: Set to `n-1` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise set to 0.
   - `pans`: A list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements.
   - `i`: Set to `n`.

2. **Analysis of the `print` statement:**
   - `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

Given that `pans` is a list with at least `n+1` elements, and `mak` and `i` are indices into this list:
- `mak` can be either `0` or `n-1` depending on the input conditions.
- `i` is explicitly set to `n`.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios for `mak`:

### Scenario 1: Input was `'>'`
- `mak = n - 1`
- `i = n`
- The print statement becomes: `print('?', pans[n-1], pans[n-1], pans[n], pans[n])`

### Scenario 2: Input was not `'>'` (i.e., it was either `'<'` or `'='`)
- `mak = 0`
- `i = n`
- The print statement becomes: `print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[n], pans[n])`

In both scenarios, `pans[n]` is valid because `pans` has at least `n+1` elements, meaning the index `n` is within bounds.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the value of `mak`:
- If the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n-1`, and the output will be `?, pans[n-1], pans[n-1], pans[n], pans[n]`.
- If the input was not `'>'`, `mak` is `0`, and the output will be `?, pans[0], pans[0], pans[n], pans[n]`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `pans[n-1]`, `pans[0]`, and `pans[n]`, we can only describe the output in terms of these indices.

Output: **?, pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i] (where mak is n-1 if the input was '>', otherwise 0, and i is n)**
