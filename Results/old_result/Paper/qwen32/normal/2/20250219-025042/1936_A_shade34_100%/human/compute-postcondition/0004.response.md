Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
- `mak` is 0.
- The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is not defined or has no explicit value given.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so attempting to print `i` would result in a `NameError`.

However, since the task requires us to determine what will be printed and we are given an incomplete state, we'll assume that `i` is intended to be defined somewhere else in the code that isn't provided. Since it's not defined, we cannot provide a specific value for `i`.

Given the information provided, the output will include the literal string `'?'`, the value of `mak` which is 0, and two undefined `i` variables which would normally cause an error but we'll represent them as `i` in the output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is undefined)**

But since the task asks for the most precise description possible and `i` is undefined, we should clarify that the code would raise an error if executed as-is. However, adhering strictly to the format and the given information:

Output: **? 0 0 i i**
