To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given information.

The loop runs for `n` iterations, where `n` is initially set to the value of `t`. During each iteration, the program prints some values and waits for user input (`s`). Depending on the input, the variables `mak` and `pans` are updated as follows:
- If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` is updated to the current index `i`, and `pans` is reset to contain only `i`.
- If `s` is `'='`, `i` is appended to `pans`.

Let's break down the final state:
- The loop will run exactly `n` times, so `i` will take on every integer value from `0` to `n-1`.
- `mak` will hold the last index where the input was `'<'`.
- `pans` will contain all indices where the input was `'='`, with the most recent index where the input was `'<'` being the first element if any such index exists.

After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mak` will be the last index where the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such index exists.
- `mak2` remains unchanged (since it is not modified within the loop).
- `pans` will be a list of indices where the input was `'='`, with the first element being the last index where the input was `'<'` if any such index exists.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak` is the last index where the input was `'<'` or `0` if no such index exists, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `'='`, with the first element being the last index where the input was `'<'` if any such index exists.**
