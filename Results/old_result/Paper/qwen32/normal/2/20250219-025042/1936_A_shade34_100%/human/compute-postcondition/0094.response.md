The code snippet `pans = []` reassigns the variable `pans` to an empty list. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, or `mak`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` is an empty list, and `mak` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists.**
