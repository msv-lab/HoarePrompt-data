Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `mak` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', `pans` is `[i]` and `mak` is the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.**
