The given Python code snippet includes `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the output stream immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `pans`, `i`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` command. Therefore, the output state remains identical to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-1`**.
