### Reasoning:

The provided code snippet and its explanation do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `a` and the initial number of players `b`.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` simply checks if the first element of `a` is less than or equal to `b` and returns `a-1` or `b` accordingly. This does not reflect the actual logic needed to determine the number of winners.

2. **Game Logic Not Implemented:**
   - The game logic involves iteratively removing players at positions specified by the sequence `a` until no more players can be removed.
   - The provided function does not simulate this iterative removal process.

3. **Incorrect Input Parsing:**
   - The input parsing part of the code is mostly correct, but the function `func_1` is not used correctly to determine the number of winners for each `n_i`.

### Correct Implementation Outline:

To correctly solve the problem, the function `func_1` should simulate the game rounds by maintaining a list of players and removing players at the specified positions until no more players can be removed. Here's a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. **Initialize the List of Players:**
   - Create a list representing the players from 1 to `n_i`.

2. **Simulate Rounds:**
   - In each round, remove players at positions specified by the sequence `a` (adjusting for 0-based indexing).
   - Continue rounds until no players are removed in a round.

3. **Count Winners:**
   - The remaining players in the list are the winners.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and therefore cannot produce the correct results for the problem.

**Correctness: False**
