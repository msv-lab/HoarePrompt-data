#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k distinct integers where 1 <= k <= 100 and the integers are in strictly increasing order with each integer being between 1 and 100 inclusive. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and each integer in b is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, resulting in a list of `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order, each between 0 and 99 inclusive.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list `b` which contains `q` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two lists as input: `a`, which contains `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `b`, which contains `q` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a` if `a` is considered less than or equal to `b`. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
