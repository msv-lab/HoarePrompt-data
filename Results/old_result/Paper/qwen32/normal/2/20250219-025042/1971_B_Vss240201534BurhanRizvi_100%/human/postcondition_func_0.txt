The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it determines if the string can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string cannot be rearranged (either because it has only one character or all characters are the same), it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" and provides a rearranged version of the string.
