Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string with a length greater than 1, and the characters in `s` are not all identical. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.**
