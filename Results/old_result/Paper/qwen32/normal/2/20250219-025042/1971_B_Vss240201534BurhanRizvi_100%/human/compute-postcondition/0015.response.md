Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string. If the length of `s` is 1, it remains unchanged. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, `s` remains unchanged unless all characters in `s` are identical, in which case `s` remains unchanged, or if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end, otherwise `s2` remains unchanged.**
