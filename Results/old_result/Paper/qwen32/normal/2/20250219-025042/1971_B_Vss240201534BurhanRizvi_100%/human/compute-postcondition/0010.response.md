The code snippet rotates the string `s` by moving its first character to the end, and assigns the result to `s2`. Given that initially `s` is equal to `s2`, after the operation `s2` will be the rotated version of `s`.

Since `s` is a string with a length greater than 1 and its characters are not all identical, the rotation will produce a new string that is different from the original `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string with a length greater than 1, and the characters in `s` are not all identical. `s2` is the string `s` rotated such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end.**
