You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: A series of "No" or "Yes" followed by modified strings `s2` for each test case, depending on the conditions specified.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the length of `s` is 1, it prints "No" because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - If the string consists of the same character repeated (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1` and `len(s) > 1`), it prints "No" because all permutations of such a string will be identical to the original string.

3. **General Case**:
   - For other cases, the program generates a random permutation of the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
   - It checks if the generated permutation `s2` is the same as the original string `s`. If they are the same, it manually creates a new permutation by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - Finally, it prints "Yes" followed by the newly formed string `s2`.

### Evaluation of the Program:

- **Correctness of Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string cannot be rearranged to form a different string:
    - Single-character strings.
    - Strings with all identical characters.

- **General Case**:
  - The program attempts to generate a random permutation of the string.
  - However, there is a potential issue with the manual permutation logic:
    - The approach of moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`) does not guarantee a different permutation for all possible strings.
    - For example, consider the string "abac". A random permutation might result in "abac" again, and the manual permutation "bacab" is not guaranteed to be different from the original string in all cases.

### Conclusion:

While the program handles some cases correctly, the manual permutation logic does not ensure that the resulting string `s2` will always be different from the original string `s` in all scenarios. Therefore, the program may not always produce the correct output as required by the problem description.
