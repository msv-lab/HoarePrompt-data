In the given initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string provided by the user input. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference either of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 1000.
2. The variable `s` is a string provided by the user.
3. The `print` statement outputs the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t` and `s`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'No'`.

Output: **No**
