### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It also reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Additions:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEF'` (note that 'G' is missing here, but since 'G' is not required for each round, it's fine).
     - If a particular difficulty level `i` from `p` is not present in the counter `hmp`, it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
     - If a particular difficulty level `i` is present but less than `m` times, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.
   
4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The string `p` is defined as `'ABCDEF'`, which means it does not consider the difficulty level 'G'. However, the problem statement specifies that each round should contain problems of difficulty levels 'A' through 'G'. Since 'G' is not included in the checks, the program might incorrectly assume that no additional 'G' problems are needed, even if they are required.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the difficulty level 'G'. Therefore, the program might not always output the correct minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
