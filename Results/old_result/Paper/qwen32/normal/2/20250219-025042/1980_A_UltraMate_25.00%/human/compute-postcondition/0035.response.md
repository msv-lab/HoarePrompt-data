The code snippet `hmp = Counter(s)` updates the variable `hmp` to be a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `ans` is 0**.
