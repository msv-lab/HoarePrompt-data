The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the initial values of `n` and `m` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**.
