You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds.
2. Each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
3. Vlad currently has `n` problems, each with a specific difficulty level.
4. The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can hold `m` rounds.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the list of problems Vlad currently has. It then calculates how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each type.

#### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m` are read.
   - The string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems is read.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - A `Counter` object `hmp` is created to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The code initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEF'` (note that 'G' is missing here, which seems to be an error).
   - For each character `i` in `p`, it checks if `i` is not in `hmp`. If not, it adds `m` to `ans` because no problems of this difficulty level are available, and `m` are needed.
   - Then, it iterates over each key `i` in `hmp`. If the count of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, it adds `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to account for the deficit.

4. **Output:**
   - The total number of additional problems needed (`ans`) is printed for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
- The string `p` is defined as `'ABCDEF'`, but it should include `'G'` as well since the problem specifies that problems of all difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G' are required.
- The logic for counting additional problems is correct, but due to the missing 'G' in `p`, the code does not account for the need for problems of difficulty level 'G'.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not consider problems of difficulty level 'G'. To fix this, the string `p` should be updated to include 'G', making it `'ABCDEFG'`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Updated to include 'G'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

# Call the function to run the program
func()
```
