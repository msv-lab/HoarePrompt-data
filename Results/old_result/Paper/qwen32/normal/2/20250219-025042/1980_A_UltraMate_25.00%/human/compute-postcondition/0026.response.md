The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to it. Here, `m` is the second integer from the input, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the string `s`, and `i` is `i_next`.

Given these details, the new value of `ans` will be its previous value plus `m` minus the count of the character `i_next` in the string `s`. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key-value pair, `i` is `i_next`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`**.

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains greater than 0, `n` and `m` retain their input values, `a` remains the same string of length `n`, `s` retains its original string value, `p` remains `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` retains its frequency counts, `i` remains `i_next`, and `ans` is now `ans + m - hmp[i]`.
