Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is the new input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the new `s`, `t` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
