### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, counting the occurrences of each difficulty level in the given set of problems, and then determining how many additional problems are needed to ensure that each required difficulty level ('A' to 'F') appears at least `m` times across all rounds.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the code:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds), followed by a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - It iterates over the required difficulty levels 'A' to 'F'.
   - If a particular difficulty level is not present in the string (`i not in hmp`), it means `m` new problems of that level are needed.
   - If a particular difficulty level is present but does not meet the requirement (`hmp[i] < m`), it calculates the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) and adds this to the total number of additional problems needed.

4. **Output**: After processing each test case, it prints the calculated number of additional problems.

### Issues in the Program:

- The program only considers difficulty levels 'A' to 'F'. However, the problem statement specifies that there are seven possible difficulty levels: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. The program should also consider 'G' when determining the minimum number of additional problems needed.
  
### Conclusion:

Given that the program does not account for the difficulty level 'G', it does not correctly solve the problem as per the provided problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
