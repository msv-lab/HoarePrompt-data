The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and that the input value read by `int(input())` must be at least 1. After executing the given code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be set to the integers provided in the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input.**
