The code snippet `s = min(m, k)` reassigns the value of `s` to the minimum of `m` and `k`. Given that `s` was previously defined as `min(m, k)`, this operation does not change the value of `s`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same with respect to the value of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + (l[0] + l[i]) * s - s * s`, `i` is 2**.
