The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is 1**
