To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration of the outer loop (which runs `t` times).

### Key Variables:
- `t`: Number of test cases (loop iterations).
- `n`, `m`, `k`: Parameters for each test case.
- `l`: A sorted list of integers for each test case.
- `s`: Minimum of `m` and `k` in each inner loop iteration.
- `c`: Accumulated value calculated based on the formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

### Loop Execution:
For each test case (`t` times), the following steps occur:
1. Read `n`, `m`, `k`.
2. Read and sort the list `l`.
3. Initialize `s = 0` and `c = k * k / 2`.
4. For each element in `l` (up to `n` iterations):
   - Update `s` to be the minimum of `m` and the current `k`.
   - Subtract `s` from `k`.
   - Update `c` by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

### Final Output State:
After all test cases have been processed, the final state will be determined by the last test case processed. Specifically:
- `t` remains the same as it is the total number of test cases.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` will reflect the values of the last test case.
- `s` will be the value of `s` from the last iteration of the inner loop for the last test case.
- `c` will be the final accumulated value for the last test case.

### Output State Format:
Output State: **t, n, m, k, l, s, c**

### Human-readable Description:
The final output state reflects the parameters and computed values of the last test case processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` hold the values specific to the last test case. The variable `s` holds the value of `s` from the last iteration of the inner loop for the last test case, and `c` holds the final accumulated value for the last test case.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the last test case has the following input:
- `n = 3`
- `m = 5`
- `k = 10`
- `l = [1, 2, 3]`

After processing this test case:
- `s` will be the value of `s` from the last iteration of the inner loop.
- `c` will be the final accumulated value.

Given the loop logic, let's compute `s` and `c` for this example:

1. `c = 10 * 10 / 2 = 50`
2. First iteration: `s = min(5, 10) = 5`, `k = 10 - 5 = 5`, `c = 50 + 1 * 5 - 5 * 5 / 2 = 50 + 5 - 12.5 = 42.5`
3. Second iteration: `s = min(5, 5) = 5`, `k = 5 - 5 = 0`, `c = 42.5 + 2 * 5 - 5 * 5 / 2 = 42.5 + 10 - 12.5 = 40`
4. Third iteration: `s = min(5, 0) = 0`, `k = 0 - 0 = 0`, `c = 40 + 3 * 0 - 0 * 0 / 2 = 40`

Thus, the final output state for this example would be:
Output State: **t, 3, 5, 0, [1, 2, 3], 0, 40**

However, since the exact values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `c` depend on the actual input, the final output state will reflect those specific values for the last test case.

Therefore, the general output state after all iterations is:
Output State: **t, n, m, k, l, s, c**
