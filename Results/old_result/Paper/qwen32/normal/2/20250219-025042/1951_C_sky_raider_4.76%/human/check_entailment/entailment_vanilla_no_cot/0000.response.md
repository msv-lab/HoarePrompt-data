Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The variable `c` is initialized incorrectly and updated in a way that doesn't reflect the actual cost of buying tickets. The formula used (`c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`) is not appropriate for calculating the total cost.

2. **Logic Error in Ticket Purchase**: The logic for purchasing tickets is flawed. The program attempts to buy tickets in a sorted order without considering the incremental increase in ticket prices after each purchase.

3. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The program does not handle the scenario where the number of tickets left to buy (`k`) is less than the maximum allowed per day (`m`). It should adjust the number of tickets bought accordingly.

4. **Incremental Price Increase**: The program does not correctly implement the mechanism to increase the price of tickets after each purchase.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy with a priority queue (min-heap) can be used to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day while keeping track of the increasing prices.

Here's a corrected version of the program using a greedy approach with a priority queue:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Min-heap to keep track of the smallest prices
        heapq.heapify(prices)
        total_cost = 0
        
        while k > 0:
            # Buy up to m tickets from the cheapest available days
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            for _ in range(tickets_to_buy):
                price = heapq.heappop(prices)
                total_cost += price
                # Increase the price of the remaining days
                if prices:
                    heapq.heappush(prices, price + 1)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program uses a min-heap to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day and adjusts the prices of the remaining days accordingly. It ensures that the total cost is minimized.
