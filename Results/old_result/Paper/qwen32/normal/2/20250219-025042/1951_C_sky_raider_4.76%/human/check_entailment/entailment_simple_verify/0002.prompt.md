You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The code sorts the list of prices `l` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which minimizes the overall cost.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of tickets bought on each day.
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This initialization seems incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The variable `c` should represent the total cost, which should start at 0.

3. **Loop Through Days**:
   - The loop iterates through each day `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and `k` (remaining tickets to be bought). This ensures that we do not buy more tickets than allowed per day or more than we need.
   - `k` is then decremented by `s`, reducing the number of tickets still needed.
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets at the current price `l[i]` minus `s * s / 2`. The subtraction of `s * s / 2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the total cost `c` is printed. Due to the incorrect initialization and update logic, the output will not be correct.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `c`**: `c` should be initialized to 0, not `k * k / 2`.
- **Incorrect Update of `c`**: The formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. It should simply be `l[i] * s` because there is no reason to subtract `s * s / 2`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        cost = 0
        increment = 0
        for price in l:
            if k == 0:
                break
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)
            cost += tickets_to_buy * (price + increment)
            k -= tickets_to_buy
            increment += tickets_to_buy
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to improper initialization and update of the cost variable `c`.

**Correctness: False**
