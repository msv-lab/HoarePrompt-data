The code snippet `k -= s` reduces the value of `k` by the value of `s`. Given that `s` is defined as `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(m, k)`.

Since `k` was initially defined as `k - min(m, k)`, executing `k -= s` means `k` is now effectively reduced by `s` again, resulting in `k` being set to `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * min(m, k)`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
