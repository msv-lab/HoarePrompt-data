The code snippet finds the index of the `start` value within the `tree` deque and assigns it to the variable `idx`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `t`, `tree`, `empty`, or `start`; it only introduces a new variable `idx`.

Given that `start` is present in the `tree` (as per the problem setup), `idx` will hold the position of `start` within the deque.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by a deque containing a sequence of node IDs from one leaf to the other leaf of the tree, and `empty` is False; `start` is an integer read from input; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**
