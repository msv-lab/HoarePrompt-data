The code snippet `tree.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the end of the list `tree`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `tree` is a list that is being constructed from the edges of the tree representation. Since `v` is an integer read from the input, appending `v` to `tree` means that `tree` now includes this new integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `empty` is False. `i` is 1. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. `tree` includes the value `v` appended to it.**
