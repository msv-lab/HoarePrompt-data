Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `tree` is an empty deque. `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `empty` is False. `i` is 0. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. If `empty` was initially True, `tree` now contains the elements `u` and `v`. If `empty` was initially False, `tree` is updated based on the following conditions: if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `tree` remains unchanged. If `v` is equal to the second-to-last element of `tree`, `tree` becomes a deque with `v` as the second-to-last element and `u` as the last element. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `tree` becomes a deque containing the single element `v`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `tree` becomes a deque containing the single element `v`. If `u` is neither the first nor the last element of `tree`, `tree` remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `empty` is False. `i` is 1. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. If `empty` is True, `tree` now includes the values `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False, and `v` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` has `u` as its first element followed by the previous elements of the tree. Otherwise, if `v` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` includes the value `u`. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the left of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `v` is appended to `tree`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. If `empty` is True, `tree` now includes both `u` and `v`. If `empty` is False and `v` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` now has `u` as its first element followed by the previous contents of `tree`. If `empty` is False and `v` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` includes the newly appended value `u`. If `empty` is False and `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `v` is appended to the left of `tree`. If `empty` is False and `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `v` is appended to `tree`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
