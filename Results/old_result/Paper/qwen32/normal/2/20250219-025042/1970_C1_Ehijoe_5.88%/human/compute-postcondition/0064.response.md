Functionality: **The function reads the number of nodes `n` in a tree, the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1), the edges of the tree, and the initial position of a stone. It determines whether, after moving the stone towards a leaf node for `t` steps, the stone ends up at a position that is an odd distance from one of the leaves. If so, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione".**
