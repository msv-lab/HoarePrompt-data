The code snippet appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. This means that the list `tree` now includes the new element `u`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tree`, which now contains one additional element `u`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `empty` is False. `i` is 1. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. `tree` now includes the value `u`.**
