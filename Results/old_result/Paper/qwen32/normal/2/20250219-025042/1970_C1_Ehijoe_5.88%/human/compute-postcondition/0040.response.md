To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is only `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
- `t` is 1.
- The tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves.
- The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round.
- `empty` is False.
- `i` is 1.
- `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

All other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree, `empty`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input.**
