The code snippet `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. This means that the list `tree` now includes the new element `u` at the end.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tree`, which now includes the newly appended value `u`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input, `tree` includes the newly appended value `u`.**
