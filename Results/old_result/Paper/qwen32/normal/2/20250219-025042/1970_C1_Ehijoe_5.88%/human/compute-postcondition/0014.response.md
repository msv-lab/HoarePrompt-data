The code appends the value of `u` to the `tree` deque. This means that `tree` now contains `v` as its last element and `u` as the new last element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round. `tree` is a deque with `v` as the second-to-last element and `u` as the last element. `empty` is False. `i` is 0. `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input. Additionally, `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree` and `v` is equal to the second-to-last element of `tree`.**
