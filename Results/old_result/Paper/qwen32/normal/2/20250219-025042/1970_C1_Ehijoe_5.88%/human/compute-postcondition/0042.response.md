The code snippet provided appends the value of `u` to the `tree` list. No other variables are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by `n-1` edges, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, and `u` and `v` are integers read from the input. The only change made by the code is that `u` is appended to the `tree` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input, and `tree` now includes `u`.**
