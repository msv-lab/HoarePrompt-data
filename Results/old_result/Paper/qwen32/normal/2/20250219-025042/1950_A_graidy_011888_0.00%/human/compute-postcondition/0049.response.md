To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This indicates the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. These are likely input values for each test case.
- `i` is set to 3. This variable is not directly used in the provided print statement.
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are new random integers between 1 and 9. These are the values that will be printed.
- The variable `res` is determined based on the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`, but it is not used in the provided print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement outputs the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, separated by spaces. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their specific values are not explicitly known from the initial state. Therefore, we describe the output in terms of these random values.

### Final Output:
Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
