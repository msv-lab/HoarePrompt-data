Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 3; `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; If `x` < `y`, then if `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'. If `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'. Otherwise, if `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'. If `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'.** 

To simplify, the postcondition can be summarized as: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 3; `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; If `x` < `y`, then `res` is 'peak' if `y` > `z`, 'stair' if `y` < `z`, and 'none' if `y` == `z`. Otherwise, `res` is 'peak' if `y` > `z`, 'stair' if `y` < `z`, and 'none' if `y` == `z`.**

However, since the "Otherwise" part does not change the logic, we can further simplify it to: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 3; `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is 'peak' if `y` > `z`, 'stair' if `y` < `z`, and 'none' if `y` == `z`.**

Thus, the final postcondition is:
Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 3; `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is 'peak' if `y` > `z`, 'stair' if `y` < `z`, and 'none' if `y` == `z`.**
