Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this represents the number of test cases).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9 (these are not used in the print statement, so they are irrelevant for this particular print).
- `i` is initialized to 1 (this variable is also not used in the print statement).
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `res` is determined based on conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z` (this variable is also not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces.
- Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are all random integers between 1 and 9, their specific values cannot be determined without running the code.
- However, we know the range of possible values for each of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output three space-separated integers, each ranging from 1 to 9.

### Final Output:
Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
