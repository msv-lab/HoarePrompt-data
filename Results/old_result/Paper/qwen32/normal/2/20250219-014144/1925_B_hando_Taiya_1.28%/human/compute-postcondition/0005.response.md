The code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `ans` was initially 0, after executing the code, `ans` will hold the maximum value between 0 and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `ans` is max(0, i), `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.**
