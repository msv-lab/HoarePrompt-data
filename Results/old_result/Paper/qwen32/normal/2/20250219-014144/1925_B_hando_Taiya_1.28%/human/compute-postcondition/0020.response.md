Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `i` is 5, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 5). The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
