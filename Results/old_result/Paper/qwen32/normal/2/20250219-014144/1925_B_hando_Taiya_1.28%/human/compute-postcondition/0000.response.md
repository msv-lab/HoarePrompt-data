The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`.

After executing the code, `x` and `n` will be assigned the values read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸.**
