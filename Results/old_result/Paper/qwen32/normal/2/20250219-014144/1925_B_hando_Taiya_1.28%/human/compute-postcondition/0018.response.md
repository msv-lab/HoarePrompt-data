The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's determine the new state:

- `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `i` is 5. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if `n` is greater than `x // i` and less than or equal to `i`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
