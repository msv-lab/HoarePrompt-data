The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression` string. If there are more characters in the `expression` string, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last processed character in the `expression` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the `expression` string to process. Therefore, `char` should be the next character in the `expression` string.

Since we don't have information about the specific characters in the `expression` string or the current position of `char` within it, we can only infer that `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the sequence. The `expression` string and its `length` remain unchanged.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (where 1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the next character in the `expression` string**
