### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
   - This is done correctly by iterating over the list of stick lengths and counting occurrences of each length.

3. **Polygon Construction Logic:**
   - The function then calculates the number of squares (regular polygons with 4 equal sides) that can be formed from each stick length.
   - It does this by performing integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 4 (`v // 4`), which gives the number of complete sets of 4 sticks of that length.
   - Finally, it sums up these values to get the total number of squares that can be formed across all stick lengths.

However, there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement interpretation within the code:
- The problem asks for the maximum number of regular polygons (not necessarily squares) that can be constructed simultaneously.
- The code only considers squares (polygons with 4 sides). It does not consider other regular polygons like triangles (3 sides), pentagons (5 sides), hexagons (6 sides), etc.

Given the problem's requirement to find the maximum number of regular polygons (of any number of sides) and not just squares, the current implementation is incomplete and incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The code should account for all possible regular polygons, not just squares, to accurately solve the problem.
