Functionality: **The function takes a list `arr` as input, where the first element indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing stick lengths. The function calculates and returns the total number of complete sets of four sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length across all test cases.**
