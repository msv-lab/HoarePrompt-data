The value of `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`. Given that `x` is `n-1`, the new value of `t` becomes `(n-1) - i + 1`, which simplifies to `n - i`.

The values of `s`, `x`, `n`, and the condition `a[0][:i + 1]` is equal to `s[:i + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n-1`, `t` is `n - i`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[0][:i + 1]` is equal to `s[:i + 1]`.**
