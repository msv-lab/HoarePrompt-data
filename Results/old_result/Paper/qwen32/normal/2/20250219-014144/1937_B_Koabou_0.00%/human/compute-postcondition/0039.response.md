`t` is assigned the value of `x - i + 1`. Given the initial state, `x` is `n-1` and `i` is `i + 2`. Therefore, `t` becomes `(n-1) - (i + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - i - 2`.

The values of `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. So, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n-1`, `i` is `i + 2`, `t` is `n - i - 2`**.
