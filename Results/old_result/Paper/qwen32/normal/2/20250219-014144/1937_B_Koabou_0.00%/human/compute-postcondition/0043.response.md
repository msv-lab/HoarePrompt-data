Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is defined as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.
2. `x` is defined as `n - 1`.
3. `t` is defined as `1`.

### Variables and Their Values:
- `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and `a[1][n - 1]`.
- `x` is `n - 1`.
- `t` is `1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(s, sep='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `sep=''` argument in the `print` function specifies that there should be no separator between the items being printed. However, since only one item (`s`) is being printed, this argument does not affect the output.
- The value of `s` is determined by the expression `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`. This means `s` is the concatenation of the first element of list `a` and the last element of the second element of list `a` (which is assumed to be a list itself).

### Output:
Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[0]a[1][n - 1] (where a[0] is the first element of list a and a[1][n - 1] is the last element of the second element of list a)**
