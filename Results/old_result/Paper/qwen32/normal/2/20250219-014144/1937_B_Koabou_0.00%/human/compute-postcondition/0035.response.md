The value of `t` is reassigned to `x - i + 1`. The values of `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `x` is `n-1` and `i` is `i + 1`.

Thus, the new value of `t` becomes `(n - 1) - (i + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - i - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `n - i - 1`**
