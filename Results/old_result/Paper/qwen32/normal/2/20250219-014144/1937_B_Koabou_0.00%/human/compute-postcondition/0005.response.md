The code appends another binary string to the list `a`. Given that `a` initially contains one binary string of length `n`, after executing the code, `a` will contain two binary strings. The first binary string remains unchanged, and the second binary string is the new input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two binary strings, where the first binary string is the original one of length `n`, and the second binary string is the newly appended binary string.**
