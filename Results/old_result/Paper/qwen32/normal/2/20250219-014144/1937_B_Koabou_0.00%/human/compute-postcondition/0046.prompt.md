You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n representing the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two binary strings, where the first binary string is the first binary string of length `n` obtained from the input, and the second binary string is the second binary string of length `n` obtained from the input.
    #
    #Using the required format:
    #
    #Output State:
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` and `x` is `n-1`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: s is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, x is `n-1`, t is `1`.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: a[0]a[1][n - 1] (where a[0] is the first element of list a and a[1][n - 1] is the last element of the second element of list a)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (representing the length of two binary strings) and two binary strings of length `n`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions related to the binary strings are met, it returns a particular value or message; otherwise, it may return a different value or handle the case accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
