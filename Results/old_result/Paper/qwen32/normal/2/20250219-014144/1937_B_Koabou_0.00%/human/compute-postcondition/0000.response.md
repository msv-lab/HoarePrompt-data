The given code snippet only initializes an empty list `a`. No other variables are mentioned or modified in the code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `a`.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n representing the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list.**
