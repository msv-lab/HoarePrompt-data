The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `s` based on specific conditions involving the two binary strings and prints `s` followed by an integer `t`. The construction of `s` involves combining parts of the two binary strings under certain conditions, and `t` is determined based on the overlap between the initial part of `s` and the first binary string.
