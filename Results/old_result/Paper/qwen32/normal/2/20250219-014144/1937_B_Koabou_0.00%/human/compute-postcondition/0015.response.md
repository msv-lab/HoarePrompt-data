Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`, `s` is a list containing the concatenated string `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is `i`, at the current index `i`, `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, `a[0][i + 1]`, and `a[1][i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
