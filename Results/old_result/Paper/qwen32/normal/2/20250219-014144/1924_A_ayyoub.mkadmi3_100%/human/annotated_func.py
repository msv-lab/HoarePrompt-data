#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The function `func_1` is defined with parameters that do not directly match the problem description; it should take four parameters: t (number of test cases), n (length of the strings to check), k (number of different lowercase English alphabets used), and s (the string to check against). However, based on the given function definition `def func_1(s, k, n):`, we assume s is the string for a single test case, and n and k are as described.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s1` is the original string `s`, `s2` contains characters from `s` that caused the `alphabet` to reset, and `alphabet` is the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of the processed string is at least `n * k`, a substring of the processed string starting from a specific index, and a string of characters that caused a reset condition.
