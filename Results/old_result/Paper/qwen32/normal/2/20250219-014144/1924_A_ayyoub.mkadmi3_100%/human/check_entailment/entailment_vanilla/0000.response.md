Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
- If they do not all occur, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Code Analysis:
The code uses a function `func_1` to process the input string `s` and determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`. Here's a breakdown of the function:

```python
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)
```

#### Explanation of `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s1` and `s2` are initialized as empty strings.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.

2. **Processing the String `s`**:
   - For each character `i` in `s`, if it is in `alphabet`:
     - If `alphabet` has more than one element, remove `i` from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has only one element, add `i` to `s2` and reset `alphabet` to include all `k` letters again.
     - Add `i` to `s1`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - Calculate `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Return a tuple:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

#### Main Logic:
- For each test case, the main logic calls `func_1` and checks the returned boolean value.
- If the boolean is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It then attempts to construct a string that is not a subsequence.
- However, the construction of the non-subsequence string seems flawed. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and repeats it `n` times, which is not necessarily a correct approach.

### Issues:
- The logic for constructing a non-subsequence string is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
- The function `func_1` does not correctly identify if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
