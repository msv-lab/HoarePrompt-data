Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` now includes the character `i` appended to its previous value, `s2` is determined based on the new `i` and `alphabet`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, `alphabet` is determined based on the new `i` and no longer contains the character `i`. Otherwise, `alphabet` is reset to `{chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}`.**

In simpler terms, the character `i` has been appended to `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `s1`, which now includes the new character `i`.
