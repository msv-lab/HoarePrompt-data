The given code snippet redefines the `alphabet` set to include only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This means that `alphabet` will now contain characters from 'a' up to the `k`-th letter.

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `s`: remains unchanged as a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i`: remains unchanged as the next character in `s`.
- `s1` and `s2`: remain unchanged unless they are dependent on `alphabet`, which they aren't in the provided code snippet.
- `alphabet`: is updated to be a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` and `s2` are determined based on the new `i` and `alphabet`, `alphabet` is determined based on the new `i` and is now `{chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}`.**
