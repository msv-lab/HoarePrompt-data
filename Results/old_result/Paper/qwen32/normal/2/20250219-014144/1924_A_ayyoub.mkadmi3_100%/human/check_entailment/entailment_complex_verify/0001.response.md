### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to verify if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`.
- If not, we must provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

#### Code Analysis:
The primary function `func_1` processes the string `s` and returns a tuple containing:
1. A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
2. A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
3. The string `s2` which accumulates characters causing the `alphabet` to reset.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)
```

##### Explanation of `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s1` and `s2` are initialized as empty strings.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.

2. **Processing the String `s`**:
   - For each character `i` in `s`, if it is in `alphabet`:
     - If `alphabet` has more than one element, remove `i` from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has only one element, add `i` to `s2` and reset `alphabet` to include all `k` letters again.
     - Add `i` to `s1`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - Calculate `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Return a tuple:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

##### Main Logic:
- For each test case, the main logic calls `func_1` and checks the returned boolean value.
- If the boolean is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It then attempts to construct a string that is not a subsequence.
- The construction of the non-subsequence string seems flawed. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and repeats it `n` times, which is not necessarily a correct approach.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Non-Subsequence Construction**:
   - The current method of constructing a non-subsequence string by finding the first character not in `s1` and repeating it `n` times is incorrect. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Logic for Checking Subsequences**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly identify if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. The logic of resetting the `alphabet` and accumulating `s2` does not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. The logic for checking subsequences and constructing a non-subsequence string needs significant improvement.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
