The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` is the next character in `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last character processed from the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next character in the string `s` if there are more characters left to process.

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, the next value of `i` should be the subsequent character in the string `s` following the current `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`**.

However, to be more precise, let's denote the current index of `i` in `s` as `index`. After processing `i` at `index`, the next `i` should be at `index + 1` unless `index + 1` is equal to `m`, in which case the loop terminates.

Thus, if we assume `index` is the position of `i` in `s` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `s[index + 1]` provided `index + 1 < m`.

State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is `s[index + 1]` where `index` is the position of `i` in `s` at the end of the previous iteration and `index + 1 < m`**.

If `index + 1` equals `m`, the loop terminates, and no further adjustments are needed for `i`. But since the task is to prepare for the next iteration assuming it will execute, we consider `index + 1 < m`.

Final State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`**.
