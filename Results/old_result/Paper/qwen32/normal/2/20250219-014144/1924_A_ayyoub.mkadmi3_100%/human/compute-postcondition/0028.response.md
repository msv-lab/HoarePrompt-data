The code snippet calculates the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k` and assigns the result to `r`. The values of `s1`, `s2`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Given:
- `s1` is the original string `s`.
- `s2` contains characters from `s` that caused the `alphabet` to reset.
- `alphabet` is the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The new variable `r` is calculated as `len(s1) // k`.

Output State: **`s1` is the original string `s`; `s2` contains characters from `s` that caused the `alphabet` to reset; `alphabet` is the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `r` is `len(s1) // k`.**
