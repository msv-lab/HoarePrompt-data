Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of the processed string is at least `n * k`, a substring of the processed string starting from a specific index, and a string of characters that caused a reset condition.**
