You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The function `func_1` is defined with parameters that do not directly match the problem description; it should take four parameters: t (number of test cases), n (length of the strings to check), k (number of different lowercase English alphabets used), and s (the string to check against). However, based on the given function definition `def func_1(s, k, n):`, we assume s is the string for a single test case, and n and k are as described.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s1` is the original string `s`, `s2` contains characters from `s` that caused the `alphabet` to reset, and `alphabet` is the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement but can be inferred as the quotient of integer division of the length of `s` by `k`), and the string `s2` (which is not defined in the problem statement and seems to be a placeholder or error in the description).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
