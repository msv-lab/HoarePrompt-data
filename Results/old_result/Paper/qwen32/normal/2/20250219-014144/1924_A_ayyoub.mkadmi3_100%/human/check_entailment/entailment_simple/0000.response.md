### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining whether all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string \( s \). If they do not, it must provide an example of such a string that does not occur as a subsequence.

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \) followed by the string \( s \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes the string \( s \), the number of distinct alphabets \( k \), and the length of the strings to check \( n \).
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first \( k \) lowercase English letters.
   - As it iterates through the string \( s \), it removes characters from the alphabet set.
   - When the alphabet set becomes empty, it resets the set and appends the current character to \( s2 \).
   - It constructs \( s1 \) by appending all characters from \( s \).
   - Finally, it checks if the length of \( s1 \) is at least \( n \times k \) and returns this condition, along with parts of \( s1 \) and \( s2 \).

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly address the problem. The goal is to check if all possible combinations of length \( n \) from the first \( k \) letters appear as subsequences in \( s \).
   - The function does not generate all possible combinations of length \( n \) and check their presence in \( s \).
   - Instead, it seems to track when all \( k \) letters have appeared in sequence but does not ensure that all possible subsequences are checked.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints "YES" or "NO".
   - If "NO", it attempts to construct a missing subsequence, but this construction is flawed due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, it fails to properly check for the presence of all possible subsequences of length \( n \) in \( s \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
