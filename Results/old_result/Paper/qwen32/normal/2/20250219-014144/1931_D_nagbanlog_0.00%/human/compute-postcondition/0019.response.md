Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 5, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 5, `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1**.

Explanation: The value of `freq[(3, 5)]` was initially 0 (as per the condition given), and after executing the line `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1`, it is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
