To determine the new value of `required_mod_x`, we use the formula provided in the code snippet:

\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = (\text{x} - \text{mod\_x}) \% \text{x} \]

Given the initial values:
- `x` is 6
- `mod_x` is 5

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = (6 - 5) \% 6 \]
\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = 1 \% 6 \]
\[ \text{required\_mod\_x} = 1 \]

Thus, `required_mod_x` is updated to 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `mod_x` is 5, `mod_y` is 5, `required_mod_x` is 1, `required_mod_y` is 6, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `freq` is `{(4, 6): 2}`, `num` is 5`.**
