You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - For a pair \((a_i, a_j)\), this translates to:
     - \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\)
     - \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\)

2. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - Let \(a_i \% x = r_i\) and \(a_j \% x = r_j\). The condition \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\) implies \(r_i + r_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(r_j \equiv -r_i \pmod{x}\).
   - Similarly, let \(a_i \% y = s_i\) and \(a_j \% y = s_j\). The condition \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\) implies \(s_i \equiv s_j \pmod{y}\).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - For each element in the array, compute its remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - Use a dictionary `freq` to keep track of how many times each pair of remainders \((r_i, s_i)\) has been seen.
   - For each element, compute the required remainders \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) such that a previous element with these remainders would form a beautiful pair with the current element.
   - If such a pair exists in the dictionary, increment the count of beautiful pairs.
   - Update the frequency dictionary with the current element's remainders.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program correctly computes the remainders and checks for the required pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary to efficiently count and check pairs, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Checking the Code:
- The code initializes a dictionary `freq` to store the counts of remainder pairs.
- For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and checks if they exist in the dictionary.
- If they do, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
- Finally, it updates the dictionary with the current element's remainders.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem statement. The use of dictionaries ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
