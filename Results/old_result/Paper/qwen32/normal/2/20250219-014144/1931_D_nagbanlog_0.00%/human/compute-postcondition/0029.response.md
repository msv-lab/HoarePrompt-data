Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 3, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 3, `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1, `num` is 3`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[(3, 3)]` is 0.**
