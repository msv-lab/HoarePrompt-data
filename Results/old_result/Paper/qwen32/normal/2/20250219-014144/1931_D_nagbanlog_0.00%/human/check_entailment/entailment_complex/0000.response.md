### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
- A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The code initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of modulo values `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered so far.
2. **Iterating through the Array**: For each element in the array:
   - It computes `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
   - It calculates `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y = mod_y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of that pair.
   - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
3. **Appending Results**: After processing each test case, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

#### Logical Error:
The logic in the code is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `required_mod_x` and the way it checks for pairs in the `freq` dictionary is incorrect. Here's why:

- For a pair \((a_i, a_j)\) to be beautiful, both conditions must hold:
  - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) which implies \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(a_j \equiv x - a_i \pmod{x}\). This part is correctly handled by calculating `required_mod_x`.
  - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) which implies \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\). This part is also correctly handled by setting `required_mod_y = mod_y`.

However, the code does not correctly accumulate the counts of beautiful pairs because it does not properly account for all possible pairs that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. The current implementation only checks for the existence of a single pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary, which is insufficient to count all beautiful pairs.

#### Conclusion:
Given the logical error in the code, the program does not correctly compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
