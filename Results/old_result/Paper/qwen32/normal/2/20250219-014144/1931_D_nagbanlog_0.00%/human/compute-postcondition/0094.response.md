To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `n` is explicitly given as 4.
- `x` is explicitly given as 6.
- `y` is explicitly given as 8.
- `a` is explicitly given as the list `[4, 5, 6]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

This statement uses an f-string to format the output, substituting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` directly into the string.

So, the output will be:
Output: **Processing Test Case: n = 4, x = 6, y = 8, array = [4, 5, 6]**
