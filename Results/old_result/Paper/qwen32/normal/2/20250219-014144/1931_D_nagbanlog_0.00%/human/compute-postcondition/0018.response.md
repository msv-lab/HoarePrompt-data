Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 5, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 5`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` which is `(3, 5)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[(3, 5)]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**
