Postcondition: **`t` is the same input integer, `s` is a string of length at least 3, `count` is 4 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 3, `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False, `j` is incremented by 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, and `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`, `i` is the initially calculated value plus 1, and the character at index `j` of `s` is '1' if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise it remains the character at index `j` of `s`.**
