The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. This means that `mak` will now hold the same value as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the value of `i`, `mak2` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the user's input as a string.**
