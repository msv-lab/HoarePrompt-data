Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` is equal to `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `s` is the string input by the user, `s` is not equal to `'<'`.**
