The given code snippet only initializes an empty list named `pans`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.**
