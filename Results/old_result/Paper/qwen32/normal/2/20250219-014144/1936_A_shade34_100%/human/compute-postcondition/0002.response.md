Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, and for each test case, the sequence `p` is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10⁴. `mak` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `p`) remain unchanged as per their initial state.
