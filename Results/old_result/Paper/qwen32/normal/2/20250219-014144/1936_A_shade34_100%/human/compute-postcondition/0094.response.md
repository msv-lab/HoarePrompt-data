The code snippet provided resets the list `pans` to an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and `pans` is an empty list.**
