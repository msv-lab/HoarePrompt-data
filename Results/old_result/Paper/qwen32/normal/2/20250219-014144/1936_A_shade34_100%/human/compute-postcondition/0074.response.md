The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer from the input. The values of `t`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the new input integer, `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `'>'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `mak2` is equal to its previous value, and `pans` is unchanged.**
