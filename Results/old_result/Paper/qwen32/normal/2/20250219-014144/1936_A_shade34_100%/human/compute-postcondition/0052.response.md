To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `n`: An integer between 2 and 10000.
   - `mak`: The largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`.
   - `mak2`: Initially set to the same value as `mak`.
   - `pans`: An initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - The program prints `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.
     - It reads an input string `s`.
     - If `s` is `'<'`:
       - `mak` is updated to the current index `i`.
       - `pans` is reset to contain only the current value of `i`.
     - If `s` is `'='`:
       - `pans` appends the current index `i`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all `n` iterations, `mak` will hold the largest index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`.
   - `mak2` will still hold the value of `mak` from the last iteration where `s` was `'<'`.
   - `pans` will contain all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, and the last index `i` where the input was `'<'` (if any).

Given this understanding, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mak` will be the largest index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`.
- `mak2` will be equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`; otherwise, it will be the previous value of `mak`.
- `pans` will contain all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, and the last index `i` where the input was `'<'` (if any).

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 0 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`, otherwise it is the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, and the last index `i` where the input was `'<'` (if any).**
