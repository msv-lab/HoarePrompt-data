The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Given that `mak` was initially 0, it now holds the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains at least two elements, and the input provided is `'>'`.**
