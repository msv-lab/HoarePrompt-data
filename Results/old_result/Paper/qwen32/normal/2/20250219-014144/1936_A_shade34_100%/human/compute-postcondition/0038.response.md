The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Therefore, `mak` now holds the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is equal to `i`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is the string input from the user.**
