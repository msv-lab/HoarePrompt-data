The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, or `pans` are altered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `'>'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `mak2` is equal to its previous value, and `pans` is unchanged.**
