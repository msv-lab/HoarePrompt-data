Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `mak2` is equal to its previous value.
- `pans` is unchanged.
- `i` is 5.
- If the input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 4.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** 
   - The initial state explicitly states that `i` is 5.
   - Therefore, both instances of `i` in the print statement will be 5.

2. **Variable `mak`:**
   - The initial state does not provide an explicit value for `mak`.
   - It only mentions that if the input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 4.
   - Since there is no information about the input being `<` or any other value, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak` from the given information.
   - Thus, we can only describe `mak` based on the condition provided.

### Conclusion:
- The print statement will output a question mark followed by two instances of `mak` and two instances of `i`.
- Given that `i` is 5 and `mak` could be 4 if the input is `<` (but we don't know the input), we describe `mak` accordingly.

### Final Output:
Output: **? mak mak 5 5 (where mak is 4 if the input is '<', otherwise it is unknown)**
