The code snippet provided appends the variable `i` to the list `pans`. However, the initial state does not specify a value for `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `pans`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `pans` will now contain one additional element, which is `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `pans` is a list containing the value `i`, `s` is the string input from the user, `s` is not equal to '<', and `s` is equal to '='**.
