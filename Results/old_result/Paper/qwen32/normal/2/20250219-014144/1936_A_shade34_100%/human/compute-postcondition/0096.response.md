Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases but is not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 0. This variable represents the length of some sequence or list.
- `mak` is the largest integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n\)) for which the input was '<'. This implies that `mak` is the index of the last occurrence of '<' in some input sequence.
- `mak2` is described identically to `mak` as the largest integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n\)) for which the input was '<'. This suggests that `mak` and `mak2` should be the same value.
- `pans` is an empty list. This list is not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is the largest index where the input was '<'.
- `mak2` is also the largest index where the input was '<', so `mak2` should be equal to `mak`.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not provided, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, `i` remains an undefined variable.

Given this analysis, the output will include:
- `'?'`: a literal question mark.
- `mak`: the largest index where the input was '<'.
- `mak2`: the same value as `mak` since both represent the same index.
- `i`: an undefined variable, which means its value is unknown based on the provided information.
- `mak2`: again, the same value as `mak`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is undefined, we cannot provide a specific value for it. However, we can describe the output in terms of the known variables `mak` and `mak2`.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are the largest indices where the input was '<', and [i] is an undefined variable)**
