To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `pans`.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(pans)` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1.

2. **Variable `pans`:**
   - `pans` is a list of indices `i` where the response was '='.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `pans` must have at least two elements (since the loop starts from index 1).

### Adjustments:

- `mak` and `mak2` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `pans` must have at least two elements to ensure that the loop runs at least once with `i` starting from 1.

### Final State:

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` remains unchanged, `pans` is a list of indices with at least two elements**.

This ensures that the loop can execute with `i` starting from 1 up to `len(pans) - 1`.
