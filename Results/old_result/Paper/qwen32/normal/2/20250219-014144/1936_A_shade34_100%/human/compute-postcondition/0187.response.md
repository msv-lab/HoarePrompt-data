Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the user's input as a string. If `s` is '=', `pans` includes the new element `i`.**
