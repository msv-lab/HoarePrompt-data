Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`mak`**: This variable is either the original value of `i` (if the input is not '>') or the new value of `i` (if the input is '>'). However, the specific value of `mak` is not explicitly provided.
2. **`mak2`**: This variable remains unchanged, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **`pans`**: This is a list of indices with at least two elements.
4. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement is executed.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. **`pans[mak]`**: This will print the element at the index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` could be either the original value of `i` or the new value of `i` depending on the input, we need to consider both possibilities:
   - If the input is not '>', `mak` is the original value of `i`.
   - If the input is '>', `mak` is the new value of `i`.
3. **`pans[mak]`**: This is repeated, so it will print the same value as the previous one.
4. **`pans[i]`**: This will print the element at the index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement, `pans[i]` will be the element at the new value of `i`.
5. **`pans[i]`**: This is repeated, so it will print the same value as the previous one.

### Final Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'`: The literal string.
- `pans[mak]`: The element at the index `mak` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[mak]`: The same element as the previous one.
- `pans[i]`: The element at the new value of `i` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]`: The same element as the previous one.

Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` are not provided, we describe them in terms of their relationship to the list `pans`.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is either the original value of i or the new value of i depending on the input, and i is the new value of i after being incremented by 1)**
