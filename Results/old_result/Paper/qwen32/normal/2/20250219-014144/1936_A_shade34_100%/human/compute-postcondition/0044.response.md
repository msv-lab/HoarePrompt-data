To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` if `s` is not `'<'`, otherwise `mak2` is the previous value of `mak`.
- `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and if `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the previous elements plus `i`.
- `i` is `i + 1` after each iteration.
- `s` is the string input from the user.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values of each variable at the point of execution:

1. **`mak`**: This variable holds the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input string `s` was `'<'`. Since the exact input sequence is not provided, we can only say that `mak` is the largest index where `'<'` was encountered.

2. **`mak2`**: This variable is set to `mak` if the last input string `s` was not `'<'`. If the last input string `s` was `'<'`, then `mak2` retains its previous value. Therefore, `mak2` could either be the same as `mak` or the previous value of `mak`.

3. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 after each iteration. The exact value of `i` depends on how many iterations have occurred before the print statement is reached. Given the range of `n`, `i` could be any integer from 1 to `n`.

4. **`mak2` (repeated)**: As mentioned earlier, this is the same as the second `mak2` in the print statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` without knowing the specific input sequence. However, we can describe their roles and relationships based on the initial state.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where [mak] is the largest index where '<' was encountered, [mak2] is [mak] if the last input was not '<', otherwise it retains its previous value, and [i] is the current iteration index)**
