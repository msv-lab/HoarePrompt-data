The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `pans`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. If `i` is less than `len(pans) - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that `1 ≤ i < len(pans)`, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴`, and `mak2` is equal to its previous value. The value of `mak` is set to `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `pans` is a list containing at least two elements.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `len(pans)` must remain the same or greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `mak` is set to `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `pans` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is `i + 1`**
