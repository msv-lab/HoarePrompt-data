The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output stream.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `i`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and `pans` is a list. `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.**
