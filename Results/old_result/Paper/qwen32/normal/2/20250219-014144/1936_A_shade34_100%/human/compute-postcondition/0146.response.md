In this task, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the range function with `int(input())`. This means that the loop variable `_` does not affect the state of the program, and the loop continues based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³,
- `n` is unchanged,
- `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans`,
- `mak2` is unchanged,
- `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, it doesn't need to be adjusted. The loop will continue as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is not yet reached.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same except for the implicit decrement in the number of remaining iterations, which is controlled by the input and not directly represented in the given state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans`, `mak2` is unchanged, and `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one.**
