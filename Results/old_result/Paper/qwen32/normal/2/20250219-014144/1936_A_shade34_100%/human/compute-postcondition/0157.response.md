The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output immediately.

Since no variables are modified by this function call, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one, `i` is `i + 1`**.
