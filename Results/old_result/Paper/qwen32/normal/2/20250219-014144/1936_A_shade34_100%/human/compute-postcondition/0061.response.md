Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n`: An integer between 2 and 10000 inclusive.
- `mak2`: It retains its previous value (not explicitly used in the print statement).
- `mak`: Set to `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `pans`: A list containing at least two elements.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

#### Variables Involved:
- `mak`: This variable is either the same as its previous value or set to `i` if the input was `'>'`.
- `i`: This variable is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed.
- `pans`: A list with at least two elements.

### Explanation:
- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` can either be its previous value or `i` (if the input was `'>'`), this will print the element at the index `mak` in the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]`: This will print the element at the index `i` in the `pans` list. Note that `i` has been incremented by 1 before this print statement.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be a formatted string starting with `'?'`, followed by four elements from the `pans` list:
- Two occurrences of `pans[mak]`
- Two occurrences of `pans[i]`

Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` and the contents of `pans` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is either its previous value or i if the input was '>', and i is incremented by 1 before the print statement)**
