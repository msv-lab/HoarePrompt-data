Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is updated to the previous value of `i` plus 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` remains the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'. `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'. `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains the previous value of `i` if `s` is '='. `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `s` is the string input by the user.**
