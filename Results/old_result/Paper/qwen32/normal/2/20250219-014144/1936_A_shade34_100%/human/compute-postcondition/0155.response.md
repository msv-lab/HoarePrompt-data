The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, and `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one. The variable `mak` is set to `i` if the current input is '<'. 

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

So, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one, `i` is 4**

Generalizing this, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i_prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Thus, the state can be written as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one, `i` is `i + 1`**
