Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `mak` is the highest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) where the response was '<'.
4. `mak2` is the highest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) where the response was '<'. 
   - Note: `mak` and `mak2` are described identically, so they should hold the same value.
5. `pans` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
- From the initial state, we know that `mak` and `mak2` are both the highest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) where the response was '<'.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` because it is not defined. However, we can describe the values of `mak` and `mak2` precisely as the highest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) where the response was '<'.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are the highest index i from 1 to n-1 where the response was '<', and i is an undefined variable)**
