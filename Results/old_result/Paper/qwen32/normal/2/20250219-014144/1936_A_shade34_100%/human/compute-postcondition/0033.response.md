Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list. If `s` is the string `'<'`, then `mak` is updated to the current index `i`, and `pans` contains the value of `mak`. If `s` is the string `'='`, then `pans` contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
