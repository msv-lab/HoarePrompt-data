Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<'. If `s` is '<', `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`. `mak2` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<'. `i` is incremented by 1. `s` is the user's input as a string. `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', or includes the new element `i` if `s` is '='.**
