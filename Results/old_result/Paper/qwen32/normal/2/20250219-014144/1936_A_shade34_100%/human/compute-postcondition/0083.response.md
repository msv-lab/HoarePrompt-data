To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 4. However, `n` is also not used in the print statement.
- `mak2` is equal to its previous value. However, there is no `mak2` in the print statement; instead, there is `mak`, which is not defined in the initial state. We'll assume `mak` is a typo and should be `mak2`.
- `pans` is unchanged. However, `pans` is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is 4.

Given these details, the print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Since `mak` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can assume it was intended to be `mak2`, which retains its previous value. Since `mak2` is not explicitly given, we'll denote its value as `mak2`.

The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 4.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? mak2 mak2 4 4 (where mak2 is the value of mak2)**

However, since `mak` is not defined and assuming it was meant to be `mak2`, the output would be more precisely described as:
Output: **? mak mak 4 4 (where mak is the value of mak2)**

But to be strictly accurate based on the given information without assumptions:
Output: **? mak mak 4 4 (where mak is the value of mak)**
