The code snippet provided sets the variable `mak` to 0. This means that the highest index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) where the response was '<' is now explicitly set to 0. The variables `mak2` and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` remains unchanged, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the response was '='.**
