The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was '>', `mak2` remains unchanged, and `pans` remains unchanged.**
