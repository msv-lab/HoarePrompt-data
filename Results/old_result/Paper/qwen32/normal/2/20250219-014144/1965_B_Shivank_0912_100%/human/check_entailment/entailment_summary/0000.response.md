### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`:**
   - The program calculates the largest power of 2 (`1 << i`) that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done using a loop that increments `i` until `1 << (i + 1)` exceeds `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence `ans`:**
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence of `ans` because it includes a term that is exactly `k` minus the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This is added to ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: Another element to help form sums greater than `k`.
   - The program then appends powers of 2 (`1 << j`) for `j` from 0 to 19, except for the power of 2 that equals `1 << i` (to avoid forming `k`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the constructed sequence `ans`.
   - It then prints the elements of `ans`.

#### Verification Against Requirements:

- **No Subsequence Should Sum to `k`:**
  - The inclusion of `k - (1 << i)` ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because it includes a term that is exactly `k` minus the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and no combination of the other terms can make up the exact difference `(1 << i)` to reach `k`.

- **All Sums from 1 to `n` (Except `k`) Should Be Possible:**
  - By including various powers of 2 and carefully avoiding the specific power that would allow forming `k`, the program ensures that all other sums from 1 to `n` can be achieved through combinations of the elements in `ans`.

- **Sequence Size Constraint:**
  - The sequence `ans` has a maximum size of 25, which satisfies the problem's constraint.

#### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
