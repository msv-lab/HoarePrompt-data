The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 1, `1 << j` evaluates to `2`.

If `ans` initially contains three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, after appending `2`, it will contain four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 2]`.

If `ans` initially contains four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, after appending `2`, it will contain five elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`.

However, since the problem specifies that `ans` contains either three or four elements depending on whether `j` is not equal to `i`, and `j` is 1, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` initially has four elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`.
2. If `j` is equal to `i`, `ans` initially has three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.

Since `j` is 1, and the condition depends on whether `j` is not equal to `i`, we should consider the case where `j` is not equal to `i` because the problem states that `ans` has four elements in this case.

Therefore, after appending `2`, `ans` will have five elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `ans` is a list containing five elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`; `j` is 1**.
