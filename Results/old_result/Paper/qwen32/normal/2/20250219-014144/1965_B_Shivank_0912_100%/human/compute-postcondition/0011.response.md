Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `i` is floor(log2(k)); `ans` is a list containing three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been updated to contain three specific values based on the value of `k` and `i`. The values in the list `ans` are calculated as follows:
- The first element is `k - (1 << i)`.
- The second element is `k + 1`.
- The third element is `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) retain their original values.
