To determine the final output state after all 20 iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 19, appending `1 << j` (which is \(2^j\)) to the `ans` list if `j` is not equal to `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `i` is `i_final`.
- `tc` is 3.
- `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.

The loop will append \(2^j\) to `ans` for each `j` from 0 to 19 except when `j` equals `i`.

Let's break it down:
- For `j = 0` to `j = 19`, the values \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{19}\) will be added to `ans`, except for \(2^i\).

Thus, the final `ans` list will contain:
- The initial three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
- All powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).

Therefore, the final `ans` list will look like:
\[ \text{ans} = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536] \]
excluding \(2^i\).

Output State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536] excluding \(2^i\)**.

In natural language, the final output state is that the `ans` list will contain the initial three elements followed by all powers of 2 from 1 to 65536, excluding \(2^i\).
