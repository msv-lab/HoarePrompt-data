To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop continues as long as \( 1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k \), where \( \ll \) denotes the left shift operator. The expression \( 1 \ll (i + 1) \) effectively computes \( 2^{(i + 1)} \).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \).
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `k` must be at least 4.
- `i` is 2.

Let's evaluate the condition \( 1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k \) with the current value of `i` (which is 2):

\[ 1 \ll (2 + 1) = 1 \ll 3 = 2^3 = 8 \]

So, the condition becomes:

\[ 8 \leq k \]

For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must hold true. Therefore, `k` must be at least 8. 

No other variables (`t` and `n`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` must be at least 8; `i` is 2**
