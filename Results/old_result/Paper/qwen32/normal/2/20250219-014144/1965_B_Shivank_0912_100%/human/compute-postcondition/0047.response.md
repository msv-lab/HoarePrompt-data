To determine the output of the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the definitions provided:

1. **List Definition**: The list `ans` is defined as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`.

2. **Value of `i`**: `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`. This means `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

3. **Exclusion of `2^i`**: The value `2^i` is excluded from the list `ans`.

Let's break down the steps to find the length of `ans`:

- The list contains 22 elements initially: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.
- One of these elements is `2^i`, which is excluded from the list `ans`.

Therefore, the length of `ans` is `22 - 1 = 21`.

Output: **21**
