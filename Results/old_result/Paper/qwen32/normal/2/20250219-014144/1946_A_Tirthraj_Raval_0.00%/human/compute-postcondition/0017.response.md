The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `n` with a new input integer. This means the previous value of `n` is replaced with whatever integer is provided through the input function. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `n`. The new value of `n` is an input integer, and it does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `p`, `res`, or `_`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`; `res` is the count of `a[p]` in `a`; `_` is the current iteration count, incremented by 1**.
