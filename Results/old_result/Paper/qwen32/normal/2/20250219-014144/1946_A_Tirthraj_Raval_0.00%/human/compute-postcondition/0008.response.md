Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer input.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
4. **`p`**: Calculated as \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\). This is essentially the index of the middle element of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.
5. **`res`**: The count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.

### Calculation of `p`:
- If `n` is odd, `p` will point to the middle element of the list.
- If `n` is even, `p` will point to the element just before the middle.

### Calculation of `res`:
- `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

### Print Statement:
The `print(res)` statement will output the value of `res`.

### Explanation:
- Since `a` is a sorted list, the element at index `p` is the median of the list if `n` is odd, or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even.
- `res` counts how many times this median (or one of the two middle elements) appears in the list.

### Final Output:
Given the above explanation, the output will be the count of the element at the calculated index `p` in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of the element at index p in the sorted list a)**
