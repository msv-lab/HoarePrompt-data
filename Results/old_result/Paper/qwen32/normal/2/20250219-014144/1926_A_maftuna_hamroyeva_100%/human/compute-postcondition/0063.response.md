The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over the string `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `j` and how it changes during each iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the third character in the string `a`.
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next character in the string `a` after the third character.

Let's denote the characters in the string `a` as follows:
- `a[0]` is the first character.
- `a[1]` is the second character.
- `a[2]` is the third character (current value of `j`).
- `a[3]` would be the fourth character (next value of `j` for the next iteration).

Since `j` is currently the third character (`a[2]`), in the next iteration, `j` will be the fourth character (`a[3]`).

Other variables like `t`, `i`, `a`, `l`, and `h` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the fourth character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 2.**
