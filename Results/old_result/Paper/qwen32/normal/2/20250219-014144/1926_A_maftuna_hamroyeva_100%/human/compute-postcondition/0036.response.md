The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `l` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 0. After incrementing, if `j` was 'A', `l` becomes 2; otherwise, `l` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the second character in `a`, `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 1, and `h` is 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 1.**
