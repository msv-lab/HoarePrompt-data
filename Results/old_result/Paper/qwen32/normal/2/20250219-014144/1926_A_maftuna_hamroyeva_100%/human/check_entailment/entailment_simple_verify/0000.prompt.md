You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, `t` remains the same as the initial integer input, and for each of the `t` test cases, the program will have printed either 'A' or 'B' based on whether the number of 'A's (`l`) in the respective string is greater than the number of 'B's (`h`). The variables `a`, `l`, and `h` will hold the values corresponding to the last iteration, but they do not affect the final output state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem statement, we need to output the character that appears most frequently. If both characters appear with the same frequency, the problem does not specify which one to choose, but the current implementation will always choose 'B' in such cases, which might not be the intended behavior.

For example, consider the input string "AABBB" and "ABBBA":
- For "AABBB", the program correctly outputs 'B'.
- For "ABBBA", the program also outputs 'B', but it should output either 'A' or 'B' since they both appear 3 times. However, the problem does not specify which one to choose in this case, but the program's behavior is consistent with choosing 'B'.

However, let's consider another example where the counts are exactly equal:
- Input: "AABBA"
- Expected Output: Either 'A' or 'B' (since both appear 3 times).
- Actual Output: 'B'

Since the problem does not specify what to do when the counts are equal, we should assume that the program should handle this case explicitly if the intention is to always choose one over the other. But based on the given problem description, the program should be modified to handle ties appropriately if needed. Since the problem does not specify tie-breaking rules, we can infer that the program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of a tie and always defaults to 'B'.

To make the program correct, we could modify it to handle ties by choosing 'A' when counts are equal, or by adding a condition to handle ties as per the problem's requirement. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif h > l:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or print('B'), depending on how ties should be handled
```

But since the original code does not handle ties correctly according to the problem's implicit requirements, the original code is incorrect.
