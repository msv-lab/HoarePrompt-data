You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a distinct string of length 5 made up of only the letters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it prints 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in a string of length 5.
- There are `t` test cases, where `t` can be between 1 and 32.
- Each test case consists of a single string of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'.
- The output should be the character that appears more frequently in each test case string.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read from the input.
   - For each test case, a string `a` of length 5 is read.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - Two counters `l` and `h` are initialized to zero.
   - The code iterates through each character in the string `a`.
     - If the character is 'A', it increments `l`.
     - Otherwise, it increments `h`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting, the code compares `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` (count of 'A') is greater than `h` (count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The problem guarantees that all strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B'.
   - In the case of a tie (i.e., 2 'A's and 3 'B's or vice versa), the code will correctly choose 'B' over 'A'. This is consistent with the problem statement, as it does not specify how to handle ties, and the given example does not include any ties.

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the solution against the provided example:

- For the string "ABABB":
  - Count of 'A': 3
  - Count of 'B': 2
  - Output: 'A' (Incorrect based on the expected output 'B')

Upon closer inspection, we realize there is a logical error in the provided code. The code outputs 'B' only when `h` (count of 'B') is greater than or equal to `l` (count of 'A'). However, the problem requires us to output 'A' when the counts are equal. Therefore, the condition should be adjusted to ensure 'A' is chosen in case of a tie.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of ties. It should output 'A' when the counts are equal, but it currently outputs 'B' instead.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
