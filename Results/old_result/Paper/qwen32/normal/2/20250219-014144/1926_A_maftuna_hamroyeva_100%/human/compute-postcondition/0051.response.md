The value of `l` is reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `l` is 0, `h` is the number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A', and if `l` was greater than `h`, then the condition `l > h` no longer holds since `l` is now 0. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h` and remains so.**
