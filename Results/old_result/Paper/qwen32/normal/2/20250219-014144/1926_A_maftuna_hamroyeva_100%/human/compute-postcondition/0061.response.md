The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `h` was either 0 or 1. After incrementing, `h` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the third character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
