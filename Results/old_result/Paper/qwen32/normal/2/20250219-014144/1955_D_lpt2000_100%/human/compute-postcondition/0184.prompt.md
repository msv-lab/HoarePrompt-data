Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `m < n`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the final intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after all iterations; `E` is a Counter object representing the final difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` after all iterations; `C` is a Counter object representing the final difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` after all iterations; `fnd` is the total count of iterations where `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k`; `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]` processed by the loop; `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n-m]` processed by the loop.`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, m, and k are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and m < n; a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; nabors is 1; aa is a list of n strings (each string is a representation of the integers originally in a); bb is a list of strings read from the input; cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the counts of the first m elements of aa; cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in bb; D is a Counter object representing the final intersection of cnt_aa and cnt_bb; E is a Counter object representing the final difference between cnt_aa and D after all iterations; C is a Counter object representing the final difference between cnt_bb and D after all iterations; fnd is the total number of iterations where pairs_in_D ≥ k; in_aa is the last element of aa[m:] processed by the loop; out_aa is the last element of aa[:n - m] processed by the loop; pairs_in_D is the final sum of the values in D.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and m < n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of `n` strings (each string is a representation of the integers originally in `a`); `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the final intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` after all iterations; `E` is a Counter object representing the final difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` after all iterations; `C` is a Counter object representing the final difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` after all iterations; `fnd` is the number of times `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` during the iterations; `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]` processed by the loop; `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]` processed by the loop; `pairs_in_D` is the final sum of the values in `D`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
