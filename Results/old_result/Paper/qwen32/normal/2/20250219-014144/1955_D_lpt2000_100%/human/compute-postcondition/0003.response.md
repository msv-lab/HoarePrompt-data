The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to a string, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `aa`. The initial state mentions that `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `nabors` are already defined with specific properties. However, the code does not modify these variables; it only introduces a new variable `aa`.

Since the input is split and converted to strings, `aa` will be a list of strings corresponding to the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings read from the input.**
