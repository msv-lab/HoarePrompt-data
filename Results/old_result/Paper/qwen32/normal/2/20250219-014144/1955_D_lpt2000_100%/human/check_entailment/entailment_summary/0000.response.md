### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window technique combined with counters to efficiently track the number of common elements between the current window of array `a` and array `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads arrays `a` and `b` and converts their elements to strings (this conversion seems unnecessary and could be optimized, but it doesn't affect correctness).
   - It initializes counters for the first window of size `m` in `a` (`cnt_aa`) and for `b` (`cnt_bb`).

2. **Initial Count**:
   - It calculates the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` to determine how many elements in the initial window of `a` match elements in `b`.
   - It counts the number of these matching elements (`pairs_in_D`).

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each subsequent element in `a` (from index `m` to `n-1`), it slides the window one position to the right.
   - It updates the counters by removing the element that is sliding out of the window (`out_aa`) and adding the new element that is sliding into the window (`in_aa`).
   - It adjusts the counts of matching elements (`pairs_in_D`) accordingly.
   - If the number of matching elements in the current window is at least `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for a test case, it prints the count of good subarrays.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**: The logic of the program correctly implements the sliding window approach and uses counters to efficiently manage the counts of elements. It accurately tracks the number of common elements between the current window of `a` and `b` and checks if this number meets or exceeds `k`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is equal to `m` (all elements must match) and when `k` is 1 (at least one element must match). It also correctly processes cases where there are no matching elements in any window.
- **Efficiency**: The use of counters and set operations ensures that the solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
