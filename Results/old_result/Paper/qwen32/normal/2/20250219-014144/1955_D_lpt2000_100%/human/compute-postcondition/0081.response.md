Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and m < n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of `n` strings (each string is a representation of the integers originally in `a`); `bb` is a list of strings read from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the final difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` after all iterations; `C` is a Counter object representing the final difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` after the current iteration; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else 0; `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]` processed by the loop; `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]` processed by the loop; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`. If `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1`. If `E[out_aa]` was 0, then `pairs_in_D` is now `pairs_in_D - 1`, `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`, `E[out_aa]` remains 0, and `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1`.**
