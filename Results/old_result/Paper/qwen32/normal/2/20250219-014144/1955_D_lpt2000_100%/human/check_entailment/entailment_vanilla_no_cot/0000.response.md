Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **String Conversion**: The program converts the elements of `aa` and `bb` to strings using `[str(i) for i in input().split()]`. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons since the problem specifies that the elements are integers.

2. **Counter Operations**: The program uses set operations (`&`, `-`) on `Counter` objects, which may not behave as expected for counting purposes. Instead, it should use arithmetic operations to adjust counts.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic for sliding the window over `aa` is mostly correct but needs careful handling of element counts. Specifically, when an element exits the window, its count in `cnt_aa` should be decremented, and similarly, when an element enters the window, its count should be incremented.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        aa = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bb = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        # Count how many elements in the initial window match with b
        pairs_in_D = sum(min(cnt_aa[x], cnt_bb[x]) for x in cnt_aa.keys() & cnt_bb.keys())
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for i in range(m, n):
            out_aa = aa[i - m]
            in_aa = aa[i]
            
            # Remove the outgoing element
            cnt_aa[out_aa] -= 1
            if cnt_aa[out_aa] == 0:
                del cnt_aa[out_aa]
            if out_aa in cnt_bb:
                if cnt_aa[out_aa] < cnt_bb[out_aa]:
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
            
            # Add the incoming element
            cnt_aa[in_aa] += 1
            if in_aa in cnt_bb:
                if cnt_aa[in_aa] <= cnt_bb[in_aa]:
                    pairs_in_D += 1
            
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the sliding window technique and ensures that the counts are updated correctly.
