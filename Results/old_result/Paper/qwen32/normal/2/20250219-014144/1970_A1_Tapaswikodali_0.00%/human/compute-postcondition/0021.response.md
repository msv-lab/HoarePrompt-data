The `details` list is sorted. Given that each tuple in `details` is structured as `(balance, -i, char)`, sorting will primarily depend on the first element (`balance`), then the second element (`-i`), and finally the third element (`char`). Since `balance` is initially 0 for all tuples, the sorting will primarily depend on `-i` (which means it will sort in descending order of `i` because of the negative sign), and then by `char`.

Output State: **`balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` sorted by `-i` and then by `char`.**
