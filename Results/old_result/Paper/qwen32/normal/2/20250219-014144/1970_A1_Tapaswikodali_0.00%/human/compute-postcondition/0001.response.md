The code snippet initializes a variable `balance` to 0. This does not affect the string `s` in any way. The initial state specifies that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of the characters "(" and ")".

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0.**
