The code snippet `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `details`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `balance` was part of the tuple in the `details` list. After executing the code, `balance` will be reduced by 1, but since tuples are immutable, the `details` list will still reference the original tuple. However, the new value of `balance` will be used in subsequent operations.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)` where `balance` has been decreased by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `char` is `s[i + 1]`.**
