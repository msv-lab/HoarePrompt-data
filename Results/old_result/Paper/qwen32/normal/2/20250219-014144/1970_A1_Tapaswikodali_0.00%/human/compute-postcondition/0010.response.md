To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `char`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate`, so we need to adjust `i` and `char` accordingly.

Given:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
- `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the index of the last processed character, and `char` is the character at that index.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` points to the last character that was processed, and `char` holds that character.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` should point to the next character in the string `s`, and `char` should be updated to hold that character.

Since `enumerate(s)` provides both the index and the character, the next value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1, and `char` will be the character at the new index `i`.

### Adjustments:
- Increment `i` by 1.
- Update `char` to be the character at the new index `i` in the string `s`.

### Example:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `char` is "(", then at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be 3.
- `char` should be the character at index 3 in the string `s`.

### State Adjustment:
The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `char`. Therefore, we adjust these two variables based on the above logic.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `char` is the character at the new index `i` in the string `s`.**

To summarize, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)`; `i` is `i + 1`; `char` is `s[i + 1]`.**
