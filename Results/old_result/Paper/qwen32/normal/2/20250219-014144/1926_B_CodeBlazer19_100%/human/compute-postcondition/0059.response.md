Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `a` is explicitly set to the string `'TRIANGLE'`.
- `b` is either an empty string or `'SQUARE'`, but this does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` remains unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `t` is greater than the value of `i`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `j` is equal to `n`, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a)
```

Given that `a` is explicitly set to `'TRIANGLE'`, the print statement will output the value of `a`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **TRIANGLE**
