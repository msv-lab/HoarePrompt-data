The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` now holds the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `a`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise in the initial state.

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is an integer.
- If `a` is not equal to 0, the condition `a != 0` holds true.
- If `a` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the code only affects `n` and does not modify `a`, `i`, or `t`, these variables retain their original properties and values.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, if `a` is not equal to 0 then `a != 0` holds true, if `a` is 0 then `i` is incremented by 1 and `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is an input integer.**
