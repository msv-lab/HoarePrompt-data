Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**: The program uses a very simplistic approach to determine the shape. It checks if there is a row with only one '1' to conclude it's a triangle, and if there is a row with more than one '1' to conclude it's a square. This logic is flawed because:
   - A square can have rows with more than one '1', but this alone does not guarantee it's a square.
   - A triangle can also have rows with more than one '1', especially in the case of an upside-down triangle.
   - The program does not check the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement.

2. **Handling of Upside-Down Triangles**: The program does not account for upside-down triangles, which are also valid according to the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered**: The program does not handle various edge cases such as:
   - Multiple rows with the same number of '1's, which could indicate either a square or a triangle.
   - Rows with varying numbers of '1's, which could indicate a triangle but might be misinterpreted as a square.

4. **No Proper Validation**: The program does not validate the exact pattern of '1's required for a triangle or a square. For example, a triangle requires the number of '1's in each row to follow the pattern \(2 \cdot i - 1\) for some \(i\), and a square requires each row to have the same number of '1's.

Here is a counterexample where the program would fail:

**Input:**
```
1
5
00100
01110
11111
01110
00100
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this example, the shape is clearly a triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square because it contains rows with more than one '1'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
