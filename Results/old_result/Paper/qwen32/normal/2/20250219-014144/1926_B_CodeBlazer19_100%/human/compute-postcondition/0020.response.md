To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is only `j`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s` is the newly read string from input
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged
- `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` is either 'SQUARE', an empty string, or unchanged
- `j` is unchanged or incremented by 1 depending on previous conditions

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that `j` is the variable being iterated over, and it will take values from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. At the start of each iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same (since it defines the upper limit of the loop).

State: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the newly read string from input, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` is either 'SQUARE', an empty string, or unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1**
