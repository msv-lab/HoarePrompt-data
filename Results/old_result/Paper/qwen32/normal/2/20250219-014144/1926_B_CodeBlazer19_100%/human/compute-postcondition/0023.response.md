Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the newly read string from input, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE', and `j` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is explicitly set to 'SQUARE', and `j` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
