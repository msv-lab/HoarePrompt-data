Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `a` is an integer, if `a` is not equal to 0 then `a != 0` holds true, if `a` is 0 then `i` is incremented by 1 and `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is an input integer.

Code Snippet:
```
a = 0
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `a` is explicitly set to 0.
- Since `a` is now 0, according to the precondition, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- However, the code snippet does not include the logic to increment `i`, so `i` remains unchanged unless it was already incremented elsewhere in the code (which is not shown here).
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, but since `i` is not incremented in the given code, this condition is not directly affected by the assignment to `a`.
- `n` is an input integer and remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only change is that `a` is set to 0. The conditions involving `i` and `t` are still valid but not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than the value of `i`.**
