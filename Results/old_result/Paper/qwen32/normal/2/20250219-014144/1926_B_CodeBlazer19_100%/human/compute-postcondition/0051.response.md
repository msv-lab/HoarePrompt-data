The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `i`, `t`, `s`, `b`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `n` is greater than 0, `i` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than the value of `i`, `s` is the new user's input, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the new `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `j` is `j + 1`**
