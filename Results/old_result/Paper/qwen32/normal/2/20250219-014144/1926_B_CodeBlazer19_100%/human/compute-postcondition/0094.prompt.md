Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the `grid` is an n × n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1'; the `grid` contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an integer. If `a` is not equal to 0, then the condition `a != 0` holds true. Otherwise, `a` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is the input integer, `i` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than the value of `i`, `j` is equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is `'TRIANGLE'` if any input string had exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is `'SQUARE'` if any input string had more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string; `j` is equal to `n` (since the loop iterates `n` times).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
