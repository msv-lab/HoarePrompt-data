Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `n-1`, `l` is 2 if `s[n-1]` is 'L' otherwise `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[n-1]` is 'L' otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, `b` is a list containing the first element of `a` followed by the second element of `a` if `s[n-1]` is 'L' otherwise `b` is a list containing the last element of `a` followed by the first element of `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If `s[n-1]` was 'L', `l` is now 2; otherwise, `l` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
