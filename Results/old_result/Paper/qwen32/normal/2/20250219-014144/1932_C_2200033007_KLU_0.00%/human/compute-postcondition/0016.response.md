Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `n-1`. If `s[n-1]` is 'L', then `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, and `b` is a list containing the first two elements of `a`. Otherwise, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `b` is a list containing the last two elements of `a` in the order `[a[n - 1], a[n - 2]]`.**
