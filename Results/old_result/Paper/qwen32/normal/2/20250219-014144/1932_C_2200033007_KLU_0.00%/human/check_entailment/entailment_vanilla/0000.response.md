Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   - We need to process a sequence of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` of length `n`.
   - For each command, we must:
     - Output the remainder of the product of all elements in the current array `a` modulo `m`.
     - Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.
   - The output should be a sequence of remainders corresponding to each command.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` of commands.
   - It calls `func_1(n, m, a, s)` which is supposed to compute the required remainders.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Building the `b` Array:**
     - The function initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n-1`.
     - It iterates over the commands in `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends `a[l]` to `b` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends `a[r]` to `b` and decrements `r`.
     - This means `b` will contain the elements of `a` in the order they are removed according to the commands.
   - **Calculating the Remainders:**
     - It initializes `p` to 1 and an empty list `ans`.
     - It iterates over `b` in reverse order, multiplying `p` by each element and appending the result to `ans`.
     - Finally, it returns `reversed(ans)`, which should give the remainders in the correct order.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders:**
     - The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and takes the remainder. However, this does not match the requirement of taking the remainder of the product of the current array `a` before any removal.
     - The product should be calculated on the current state of `a` before any element is removed, not on the order of removal.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it calculates the product of elements in the order they are removed rather than calculating the product of the current array before any removal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
