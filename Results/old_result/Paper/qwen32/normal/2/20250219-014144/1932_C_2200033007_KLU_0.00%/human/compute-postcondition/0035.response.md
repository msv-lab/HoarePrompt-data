To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop iterates over the list `b` in reverse order, updating the product `p` and appending it to the list `ans`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: remains unchanged.
   - `n`: remains unchanged.
   - `m`: remains unchanged.
   - `a`: remains unchanged.
   - `s`: remains unchanged.
   - `b`: remains unchanged.
   - `l`: remains unchanged.
   - `r`: remains unchanged.
   - `ans`: starts as an empty list.
   - `p`: starts as 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop takes the next element `v` from the reversed list `b`.
   - It multiplies `p` by `v` and appends the new value of `p` to `ans`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
   - `p` will be the product of all elements in `b`.

Let's formalize the final state:

- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- `ans` will be a list of cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
- `p` will be the product of all elements in `b`.

**Natural Language Explanation**:
After the loop finishes executing, the variable `ans` will contain a list of cumulative products of the elements in `b` when traversed in reverse order. Each element in `ans` represents the product of all elements in `b` up to that point in the reversed traversal. The variable `p` will hold the final product of all elements in `b`.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.**
