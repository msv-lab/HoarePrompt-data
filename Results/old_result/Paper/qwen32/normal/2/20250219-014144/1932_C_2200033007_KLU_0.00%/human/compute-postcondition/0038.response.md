Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It also accepts `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). The function returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of elements in another list `b` from the last element to the first.**
