The code snippet provided decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- Depending on the value of `s[i]`:
  - If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing `[a[0], a[n - 1]]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`
  - Otherwise, `b` is a list containing `[a[n - 1], a[n - 2]]`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`
- `i` is `n-1`

After executing `r -= 1`, the value of `r` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing `[a[0], a[n - 1]]` if `s[i]` is 'L' or `[a[n - 1], a[n - 2]]` otherwise, `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is 'L' or 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 2` if `s[i]` is 'L' or `n - 3` otherwise, `i` is `n-1`**.
