The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from 29 down to 0. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to decrement `i` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `t` remains an empty list.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- Depending on the values of `u` and `v`, various operations are performed on `op`, `cnt`, and `ans`.

Since only `i` can be adjusted according to the loop head, we simply decrement `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is 28**.
