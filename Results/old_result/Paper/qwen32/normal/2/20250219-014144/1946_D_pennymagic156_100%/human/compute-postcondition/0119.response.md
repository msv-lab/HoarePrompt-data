The given code snippet initializes two variables, `op` and `ai`, to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`) are affected by this code. Therefore, their values remain the same as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `i` is 28. `u` is the 28th bit of `x`. `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. `op` is 0. `ai` is 0. If `u == v == 0`, the state remains as described above. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
