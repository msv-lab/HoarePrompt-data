The given code snippet only increments the value of `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `op`) are modified by this code.

Therefore, the updated value of `cnt` will be 1, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 1, and `op` is 0**.
