Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is 0, `v` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, or `v`, their values remain the same as specified in the initial state.
