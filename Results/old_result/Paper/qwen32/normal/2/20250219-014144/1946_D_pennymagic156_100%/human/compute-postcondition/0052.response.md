Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`, `v` is even and not zero, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 3 if the initial `op` was 0, otherwise `cnt` is 2, `val` is the next element in `a`.**
