The only object in the loop head is the variable `val`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `val` to the next element in the list `a`.

Given that `a` has at least one element and `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`, `v` is even and not zero, and `op` is `(val >> i & 1)` for some `val` in `a`, we need to ensure that `val` is set to the next element in `a` for the loop to continue.

Since `val` was the current element in the previous iteration, it needs to be updated to the next element in the list `a`. We don't have specific information about the number of elements in `a` or their values, but we know that there is at least one element left to iterate over.

State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`, `v` is even and not zero, `op` is `(val >> i & 1)` for some `val` in `a`. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in `a`**
