The code initializes two new variables `t` and `ans`. The variable `t` is initialized as an empty list, and `ans` is initialized to -1. The variables `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they were previously assigned values from function calls.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. The variable `a` is now the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `ans` is -1.**
