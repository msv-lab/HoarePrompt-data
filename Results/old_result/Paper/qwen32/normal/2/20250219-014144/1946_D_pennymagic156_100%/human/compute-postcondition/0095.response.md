The given code snippet modifies the variable `op` using the XOR assignment operator (`^=`) with the expression `val >> i & 1`. Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Since `v` is even and non-zero, and `u` is not equal to 0, these conditions remain valid. The specific value of `op` depends on the current value of `op` and the value of `val >> i & 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 0**.
