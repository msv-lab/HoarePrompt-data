The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, or `v` are modified.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.**
