The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given that `ai` is `val` if `op` was initially `False`, otherwise `ai` is `0`, the list `t` will either contain `val` or `0` depending on the initial value of `op`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least 30 elements, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `t` is a list containing `val` if `op` was initially `False`, otherwise `t` is `[0]`, `ai` is `val` if `op` was initially `False`, otherwise `ai` is `0`, `val` is the 30th element of `a`.**

In natural language: The list `t` now contains `val` if `op` was initially `False`; otherwise, it contains `[0]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
