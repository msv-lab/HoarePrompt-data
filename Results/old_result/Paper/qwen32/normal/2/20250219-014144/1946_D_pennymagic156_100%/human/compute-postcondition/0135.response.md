The given code snippet modifies the variable `ai` by performing an XOR operation with `val`. The other variables mentioned (`op`, `a`, `i`, `val`) are not directly modified by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Given that `ai` is being updated, the new state of `ai` will be the result of `ai ^ val`.

Output State: **The loop terminates as there are no more elements in `a` after the 30th element; `op` is updated to `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`; `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`.**
