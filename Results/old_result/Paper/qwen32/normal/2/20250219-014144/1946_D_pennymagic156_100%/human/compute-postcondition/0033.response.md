The given code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Before the swap, `a` holds the value returned by `func_1()`, and `t` is a list that contains `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0. After the swap, `a` will hold the list `t`, and `t` will be an empty list.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0, `t` is [], `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is the result of XOR operations, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0 at the end of the loop; otherwise, it is the XOR of all elements in `a`.**
