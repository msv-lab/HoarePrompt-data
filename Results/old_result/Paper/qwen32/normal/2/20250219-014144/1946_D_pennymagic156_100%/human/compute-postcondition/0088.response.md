Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.**
