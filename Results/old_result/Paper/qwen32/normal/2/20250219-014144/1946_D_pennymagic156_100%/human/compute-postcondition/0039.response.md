Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even, and `v` is not zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. Two new variables, `op` and `cnt`, are introduced and both are set to 0.
