Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `u == 0`, no changes are made to `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, or `v`. If `u != 0`, and `v` is odd, no additional changes are made. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is set to 0, `cnt` is set to `len(a) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is zero, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
