Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. `op` is 0. `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `u` equals 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value where the first `ai` value is now `ai ^ val`. If `op` is 0, `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list. `u` equals 0, and `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. `val` is the second element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing at least two `ai` values where the first `ai` value is the original value before the first XOR operation with `val`. If `op` was 0, `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list and now includes `ai`. `u` equals 0, and `v` is the sum of the bitwise AND of each element in `a` right-shifted by `i` bits. `op` is the result of `op` XOR the bitwise AND of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits. `val` is the third element of `a`. If `op` was 0, `ai` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
