The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is `val`, the list `t` now contains `val` as its first element. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is a list containing `val`, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the 28th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`. The 28th bit of `val` (`op`) is 0.**
