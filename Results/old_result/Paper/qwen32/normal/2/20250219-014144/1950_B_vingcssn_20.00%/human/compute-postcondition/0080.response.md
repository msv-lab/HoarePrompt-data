Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is `c + 1`, ensuring `c < casos`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

From the initial state, we see that the print statement directly outputs the string `'..##..##'`. There are no variables or conditions affecting the content of this string. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c`.

Output: **..##..##**
