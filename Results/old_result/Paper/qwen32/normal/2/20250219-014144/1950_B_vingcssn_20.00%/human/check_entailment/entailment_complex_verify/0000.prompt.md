You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, and `c` is equal to `casos`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and prints a specific pattern of hashes (`#`) and dots (`.`) based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 4, it prints "No esta en el rango".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). It explicitly checks for these values and prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, the problem description specifies that `n` can be any integer from 1 to 20. Therefore, the program will not work correctly for any value of `n` outside of these specific cases (i.e., for `n` equal to 5 through 20). For example, if `n` is 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the appropriate 10x10 checkerboard pattern. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all possible inputs within the specified range.
