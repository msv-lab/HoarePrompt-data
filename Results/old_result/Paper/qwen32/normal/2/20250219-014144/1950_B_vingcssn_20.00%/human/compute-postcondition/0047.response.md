The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a specific string regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.

None of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'..##..'`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **..##..**
