The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on user input. The values of `t`, `casos`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, `c` is `c + 1`, ensuring `c < casos`**.
