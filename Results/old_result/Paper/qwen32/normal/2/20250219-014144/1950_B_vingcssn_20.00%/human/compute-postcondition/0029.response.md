The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a specific string, `'..##..##'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`) and their constraints, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string provided in the code.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables do not affect the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'..##..##'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
