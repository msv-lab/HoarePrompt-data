Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and prints a specific pattern of hashes (`#`) and dots (`.`) based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 4, it prints "No esta en el rango".**
