Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is `c + 1`, ensuring `c < casos`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##..##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. The string `'##..##'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as it is.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'##..##'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **##..##**
