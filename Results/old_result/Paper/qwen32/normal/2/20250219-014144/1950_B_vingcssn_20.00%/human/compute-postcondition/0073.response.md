Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is `c + 1`, ensuring `c < casos`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('..##..')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c`. It simply prints the string `'..##..'`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'..##..'`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Output: **..##..**
