The provided initial state describes several variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c`) and their constraints, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string `'##'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 20, inclusive.
- `casos`: An integer between 1 and 20, inclusive.
- `n`: An input integer (its specific value is not specified).
- `c`: Incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **##**
