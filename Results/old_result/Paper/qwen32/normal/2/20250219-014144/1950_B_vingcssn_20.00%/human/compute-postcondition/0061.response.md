Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, and `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`. If `n` equals 2, no additional changes occur. If `n` equals 3, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 again regardless of the value of `n`.**
