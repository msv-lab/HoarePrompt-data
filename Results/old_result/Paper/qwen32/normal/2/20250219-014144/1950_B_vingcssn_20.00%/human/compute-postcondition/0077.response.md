The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'##..##..'`. This string is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, `c`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The `print` statement is `print('##..##..')`.
2. **Examine the String**: The string `'##..##..'` is explicitly defined within the `print` statement.
3. **Variable Influence**: None of the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c` are used within the `print` statement. Hence, their values do not affect the output.
4. **Output Determination**: Since the string is hardcoded, the output will always be `'##..##..'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##..**
