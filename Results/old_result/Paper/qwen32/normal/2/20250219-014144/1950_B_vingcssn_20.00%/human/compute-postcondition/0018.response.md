The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'##..##'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`) with specific constraints and values, but these variables are not used within the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is `print('##..##')`.
- The string `'##..##'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
