Correctness: **False**

The given program only handles the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. It does not handle any other values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For values of `n` greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango", which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The program should generate the appropriate checkerboard pattern for all valid values of `n`.
