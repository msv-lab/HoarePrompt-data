The `print('##..')` statement directly outputs the string `'##..'` without referencing any variables or conditions that would change its content based on the initial state provided.

Here's the breakdown:
- The string `'##..'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.
- No variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, `c`) are used in this particular `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'##..'`.

Output: **##..**
