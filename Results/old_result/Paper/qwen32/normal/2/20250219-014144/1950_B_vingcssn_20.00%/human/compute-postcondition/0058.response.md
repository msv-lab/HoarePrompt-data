Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'No esta en el rango'`. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement itself that would change the output based on the initial state provided.

### Output:
The output is simply the string inside the print statement.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
