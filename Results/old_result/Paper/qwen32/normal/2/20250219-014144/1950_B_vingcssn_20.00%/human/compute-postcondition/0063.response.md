To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `c` and `casos`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.
- If `n` equals 1, no additional changes occur.
- If `n` equals 2 or 3, no additional changes occur.
- For any other value of `n`, `c` is incremented by 1 again.

The loop statement is:
```python
for c in range(0, casos):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we know that `c` is the loop variable and it ranges from 0 to `casos - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `c` has been incremented by 1.
- Depending on the value of `n`, `c` might have been incremented an additional time.

Since `c` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration (as per the `range` function), and potentially again based on the value of `n`, we need to adjust `c` accordingly at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. If `n` was 1, 2, or 3, `c` was incremented by 1.
2. If `n` was any other value, `c` was incremented by 2.

However, since we are determining the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `c` just before the loop increments it automatically. Therefore, we need to set `c` to the value it would have before the automatic increment.

Given that `c` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the value of `c` at the start of the next iteration should be the current value of `c` plus 1 (if `n` was 1, 2, or 3) or plus 2 (if `n` was any other value) minus 1 (since the loop will increment it automatically).

Thus, the value of `c` at the start of the next iteration should simply be the current value of `c` plus 1 (regardless of the value of `n`), because the loop will handle the automatic increment.

So, if `c` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`**.

Since `c` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`**.

Simplifying, if `c` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, `c` is `c + 1`, ensuring `c < casos`**.
