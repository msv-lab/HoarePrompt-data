In this task, the initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`), but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it prints a fixed string `'..##..'`.

Let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
- `n` is an integer that is neither 1 nor 2, and in the current state, `n` is 3.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **..##..**
