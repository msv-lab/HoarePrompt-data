The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is 3 in this case. Since `j` is the only variable that changes within the loop, we need to adjust it for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96`; `j` is 1.**
