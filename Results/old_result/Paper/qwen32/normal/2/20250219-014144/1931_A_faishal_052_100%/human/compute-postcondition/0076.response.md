Given the initial state and the operation `lex = lex - 26`, let's determine the new state of the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `arr` depends on the original value of `lex`:
  - `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was originally less than 26,
  - `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77,
  - `[1, 26]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78,
  - `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27,
  - `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78,
  - `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78.
- `lex` has been decremented by 1 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 26 if it was originally less than or equal to 78.
- `info` contains an empty list as its last element.
- `i` is `x + 1`.
- `cases` remains unchanged.
- `j` is 2.

### Operation:
- `lex = lex - 26`

### New State Calculation:

#### Case Analysis Based on Original `lex` Value:
1. **If `lex` was originally less than 26:**
   - After decrementing by 1, `lex` was between 0 and 25.
   - After reducing by 26, `lex` becomes negative (specifically, between -26 and -1).
   - `arr` was `[1, 1, 26]`.

2. **If `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77:**
   - After reducing by 26, `lex` becomes between -25 and 51 or between 26 and 51.
   - `arr` was `[26, 1, 26]`.

3. **If `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78:**
   - After reducing by 26, `lex` becomes between 51 and 52.
   - `arr` was `[1, 26]`.

4. **If `lex - 26` is less than 27:**
   - This means `lex` was between 26 and 52.
   - After reducing by 26, `lex` becomes between 0 and 26.
   - `arr` was `[1, 26, 26]`.

5. **If `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78:**
   - This means `lex` was between 28 and 78.
   - After reducing by 26, `lex` becomes between 2 and 52 or between 27 and 52.
   - `arr` was `[26, 26, 26]`.

6. **If `lex - 26` is greater than 78:**
   - This means `lex` was greater than 104.
   - After reducing by 26, `lex` becomes greater than 78.
   - `arr` was `[26, 26]`.

### Output State:
Given the operation `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` depends on its previous value. The array `arr` remains unchanged because the operation does not affect its construction logic directly. The other variables (`info`, `i`, `cases`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 26]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78; `lex` is decreased by 26; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 2.**
