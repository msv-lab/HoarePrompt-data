The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `info`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `cases`. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain within their specified ranges, and `cases` retains its input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer, `info` is an empty list.**
