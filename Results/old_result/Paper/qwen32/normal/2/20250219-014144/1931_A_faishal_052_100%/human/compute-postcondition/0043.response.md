The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Therefore, `info` now contains `arr` as its last element. The values of `arr` and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order and includes the element `lex`; `lex` is unchanged; `info` contains `arr` as its last element.**
