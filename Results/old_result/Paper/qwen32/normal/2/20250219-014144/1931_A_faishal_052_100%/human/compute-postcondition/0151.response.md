In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the constant value 3. The loop head only involves the variable `j`, which is the loop control variable. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to the loop control variable `j`.

Since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 2`, the initial value of `j` before entering the loop should be 0. The other variables (`info`, `cases`, `t`, `n`, `i`, `temp`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is an empty string; `j` is 0**
