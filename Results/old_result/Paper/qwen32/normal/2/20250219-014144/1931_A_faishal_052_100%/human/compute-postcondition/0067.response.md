Output State: **`arr` is a list that contains two elements `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 27, contains the integers `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and is a list containing only the integer `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 78; `lex` is an integer; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial state of `arr`, which is determined by the value of `lex`, the resulting `arr` will contain `26` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.
