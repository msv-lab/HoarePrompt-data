The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, but since the loop condition checks if `j` is less than 2, the loop will not execute again if `j` is already 2.

However, to describe the state right before the next (non-executing) iteration, we simply increment `j` from 1 to 2.

State: **`arr` is a list that contains two elements `[1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, and `[26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 26 if it was originally less than or equal to 78. `info` contains an empty list as its last element. `i` is `x + 1`. `cases` remains unchanged. `j` is 2**
