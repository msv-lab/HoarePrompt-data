Postcondition: **`arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was originally less than 26; `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77; `[1, 26]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78; `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` was less than 27; `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78; `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78. `lex` is now `lex - 26` if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78. `info` contains an empty list as its last element. `i` is `x + 1`. `cases` remains unchanged. `j` is 2.**
