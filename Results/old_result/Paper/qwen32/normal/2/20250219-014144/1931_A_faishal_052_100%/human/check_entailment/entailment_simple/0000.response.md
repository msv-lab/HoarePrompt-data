### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Generating Possible Letters:**
   - The program attempts to generate three letters based on the value of `lex`.
   - It uses a loop to handle the first two letters:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends `1` (corresponding to 'a') to the array `arr` and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends `26` (corresponding to 'z') to the array `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends `26` (corresponding to 'z') to the array `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After handling the first two letters, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr` as the third letter.

3. **Sorting and Generating Output:**
   - The array `arr` containing the values for the three letters is sorted.
   - These values are converted to their corresponding characters using `chr(value + 96)` and concatenated to form the final word.
   - This word is printed as the output for each test case.

### Issues with the Logic:

- **Incorrect Handling of Values:**
  - The logic for determining the values of the first two letters is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if `lex` is less than 28, the first letter should be 'a'. However, this does not consider the possibility of other combinations that could yield the same sum.
  - Similarly, the logic for values between 28 and 51 and 52 and 78 is overly simplistic and does not account for all possible combinations of letters that could sum up to the given `lex`.

- **Lexicographical Order:**
  - Sorting the array `arr` after determining its values does not guarantee that the resulting word will be lexicographically smallest. The sorting step is unnecessary and incorrect in this context.

### Correct Approach:

To find the lexicographically smallest word, the program should systematically try to assign the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then determine the third letter accordingly. This can be done by iterating over possible values for the first two letters and checking if the remaining value for the third letter is valid (i.e., between 1 and 26).

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the current logic, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
