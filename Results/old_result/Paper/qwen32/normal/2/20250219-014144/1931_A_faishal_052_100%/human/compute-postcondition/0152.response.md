The code snippet concatenates the ASCII character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96` to the `temp` string. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, the character added to `temp` is determined by the value of `info[2][0]`.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96`; `j` is 0.**

In simpler terms, `temp` now holds the character derived from the value of `info[2][0]` shifted by 96 in the ASCII table, while all other variables retain their initial values.
