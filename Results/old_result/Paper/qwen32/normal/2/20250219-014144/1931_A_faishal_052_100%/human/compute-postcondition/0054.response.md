The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. Given that `lex` was initially an input integer greater than or equal to 28 but less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be an integer greater than or equal to 2 but less than 26. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing the integer `26`; `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 but less than 26; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged.**
