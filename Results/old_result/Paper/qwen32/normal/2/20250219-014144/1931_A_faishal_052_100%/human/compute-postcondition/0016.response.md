Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an input integer, `lex` is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, so if `lex` was originally between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it is now between 26 and 52 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
