To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

The loop iterates over a range of 3, meaning it will execute exactly 3 times. In each iteration, it appends a character to the `temp` string based on the value in `info[i][j]`.

From the given output states after the first three iterations, we can see that:
- After the first iteration (`j=0`), `temp` contains the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`.
- After the second iteration (`j=1`), `temp` contains the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`.
- After the third iteration (`j=2`), `temp` contains the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`.

Since the loop runs exactly 3 times and `j` ranges from 0 to 2, after the loop finishes, `temp` will contain the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`.

The other variables (`info`, `t`, `n`, `cases`, and `i`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `temp` will be a string formed by converting the first three elements of the first array in `info` to their corresponding characters using the formula `chr(value + 96)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
