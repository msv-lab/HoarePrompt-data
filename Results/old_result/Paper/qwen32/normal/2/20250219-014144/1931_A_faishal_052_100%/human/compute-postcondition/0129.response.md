To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(cases):`, which means the variables `i` and `cases` are relevant.

Given the initial state:
- `info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- `cases` remains unchanged.
- `i` equals `cases`.

For the loop to execute, the `range(cases)` must produce at least one value, which means `cases` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the loop variable `i` should start from 0, as `range(cases)` generates values starting from 0 up to (but not including) `cases`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to 0 to ensure the loop starts correctly.

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
