The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an integer such that 2 ≤ lex < 26.**
