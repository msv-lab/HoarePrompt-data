The `arr.sort()` operation sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since `lex` is included in `arr` and its value is unchanged, `lex` will now be in its correct sorted position within `arr`. All other elements in `arr` will also be rearranged accordingly to maintain the sorted order.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order and includes the element `lex`; `lex` is unchanged.**
