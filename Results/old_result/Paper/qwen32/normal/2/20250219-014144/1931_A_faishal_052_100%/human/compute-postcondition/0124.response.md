To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop and the conditions under which it operates. The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop behaves based on the value of `lex`:

1. **First Iteration (j=0)**:
   - If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 1.
   - If `28 <= lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 26.
   - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 26.

2. **Second Iteration (j=1)**:
   - The same logic applies as in the first iteration with the updated value of `lex`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios based on the initial value of `lex`:

- **If `lex < 28`**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` could be `[1, 1]` if `lex - 1 < 28`, `[26, 1]` if `28 <= lex - 1 < 52`, or `[1]` if `lex - 1 >= 52`.

- **If `28 <= lex < 52`**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` could be `[26, 1]` if `lex - 26 < 28`, `[26, 26]` if `28 <= lex - 26 < 52`, or `[26]` if `lex - 26 >= 52`.

- **If `52 <= lex <= 78`**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` could be `[26, 1]` if `lex - 26 < 28`, `[26, 26]` if `28 <= lex - 26 < 52`, or `[26]` if `lex - 26 >= 52`.

- **If `lex > 78`**:
  - The loop does not change `arr` or `lex` since the conditions for appending to `arr` are not met.

Given the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will execute exactly 2 times and the final state will be determined by the value of `lex` after the second iteration.

Considering the scenarios above, the final possible states of `arr` after the loop completes are:
- `[1, 1]`
- `[26, 1]`
- `[1, 26]`
- `[26, 26]`

However, since the loop runs only 2 times, the state after the third iteration does not affect the final state. Therefore, the final output state depends on the initial value of `lex` and how it changes after the two iterations.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume an initial value of `lex` that falls within one of the scenarios. For instance, if `lex` is initially 27:
- After the first iteration, `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` is 26.
- After the second iteration, `arr` is `[1, 1]` and `lex` is 25.

Thus, the final output state would be:

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, 25]` as its last element; `i` is 4.**

This state can vary depending on the initial value of `lex`, but the format and structure will remain consistent with the described logic.
