To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- Initial State:
  - `arr` is `[1, 1]`
  - `info` includes `[26, 26, 25]` as its last element
  - `i` is `4`

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  arr.append(lex)
  ```

The code snippet appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. However, the variable `lex` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet provided. Since `lex` is not defined, we cannot determine its value. For the sake of providing a complete answer, we'll assume `lex` is a variable that holds a specific value, and we'll represent the new state of `arr` accordingly.

Given that `lex` is not specified, let's denote its value as `lex_value`. After appending `lex` to `arr`, the new state of `arr` will be `[1, 1, lex_value]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1, lex_value]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, 25]` as its last element; `i` is 4.**

This means that `arr` now contains three elements, with the third element being the value of `lex`, while `info` and `i` remain unchanged.
