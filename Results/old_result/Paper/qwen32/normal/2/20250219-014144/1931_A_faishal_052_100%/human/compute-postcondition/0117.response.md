The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` could be one of several lists, and appending `26` to each of these lists results in a new specific list.

Here are the possible transformations:
- If `arr` was `[]`, it becomes `[26]`.
- If `arr` was `[1]`, it becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `arr` was `[26]`, it becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `arr` was `[1, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `arr` was `[26, 1]`, it becomes `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If `arr` was `[1, 26]`, it becomes `[1, 26, 26]`.
- If `arr` was `[26, 26]`, it becomes `[26, 26, 26]`.

The other variables (`info`, `i`, `lex`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is either `[26]`, `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer; `j` is 2.**
