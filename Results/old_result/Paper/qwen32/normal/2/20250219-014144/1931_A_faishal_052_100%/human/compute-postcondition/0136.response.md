The code appends the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][2] + 96)` to the `temp` string. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the character `chr(info[0][2] + 96)` is added to `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2.**
