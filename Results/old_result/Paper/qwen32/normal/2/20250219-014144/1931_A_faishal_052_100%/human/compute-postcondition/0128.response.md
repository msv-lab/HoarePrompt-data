To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop behaves based on the given conditions and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

### Analysis of the Loop Behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` (an integer between 1 and 100) and `n` (an integer between 3 and 78) are initialized but not used in the loop.
   - `cases` is the number of iterations the loop will run.
   - `info` is an initially empty list that will store arrays generated in each iteration.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration (`i` from 0 to `cases-1`):
     - An empty array `arr` is initialized.
     - `lex` is read from the input.
     - The inner loop runs twice, modifying `arr` based on the value of `lex`:
       - If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `1`.
       - If `28 <= lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.
       - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.
     - After the inner loop, append the remaining `lex` value to `arr`.
     - Sort `arr` in ascending order.
     - Append the sorted `arr` to the `info` list.

### Given Output States:

1. **After 1 Iteration**:
   - `arr` is sorted and includes `lex`.
   - `lex` remains unchanged.
   - `info` contains `arr` as its last element.

2. **After 2 Iterations**:
   - `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`.
   - `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element.

3. **After 3 Iterations**:
   - `arr` is either `[lex_value, 1, 1]` if `lex_value` is less than or equal to `1`, or `[1, 1, lex_value]` if `lex_value` is greater than `1`.
   - `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` and `[1, 1, lex_value]` as its last elements.
   - `i` is 4 (meaning the loop has run 3 times).

### Final Output State:

The loop will continue to execute until it has run `cases` times. Each iteration will generate an `arr` based on the input `lex`, sort it, and append it to `info`.

Since the exact values of `lex` for each iteration are not provided, we can generalize the final state:

- `info` will contain `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- `cases` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be equal to `cases` after the loop completes.

### Conclusion:

The final output state will be:

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` remains unchanged; `i` equals `cases`.**

In simpler terms, the `info` list will have `cases` sorted arrays, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`) will retain their initial values.
