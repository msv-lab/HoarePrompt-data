The code appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. This means that regardless of the initial contents of `arr`, a `1` will be added to the end of the list. 

Given the initial conditions for `arr`, the new state of `arr` will be:
- `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 26,
- `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77,
- `[1, 1]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78,
- `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27,
- `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78,
- `[26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 1]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `[26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78; `lex` is an integer that has been decremented by 1 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 26 if it was originally less than or equal to 78; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 2**
