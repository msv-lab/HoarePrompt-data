Output State: **`arr` is either `[lex_value, 1, 1]` if `lex_value` is less than or equal to `1`, or `[1, 1, lex_value]` if `lex_value` is greater than `1`; `info` includes `[26, 26, 25, arr]` as its last element; `i` is 4.**

Natural Language Explanation: The array `arr` remains unchanged. The list `info` now includes `arr` as its last element, making its last element either `[lex_value, 1, 1]` if `lex_value` is less than or equal to `1`, or `[1, 1, lex_value]` if `lex_value` is greater than `1`. The variable `i` remains 4.
