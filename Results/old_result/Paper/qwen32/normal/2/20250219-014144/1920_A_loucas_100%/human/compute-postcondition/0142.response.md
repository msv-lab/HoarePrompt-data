The given Python code snippet is `num -= 1`. This line of code decrements the value of the variable `num` by 1.

Given the Initial State, the only variable that gets affected by this operation is `num`.

The new value of `num` will be the previous value of `num` minus 1. Since the initial value of `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, after decrementing by 1, the new value of `num` will be `min(less) - max(big)`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `less`, `big`, `no`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains at least one element, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` was not 1, and `innerLoop` remains unchanged. `i` is the next element in `no` after the current `i` from the previous iteration.**
