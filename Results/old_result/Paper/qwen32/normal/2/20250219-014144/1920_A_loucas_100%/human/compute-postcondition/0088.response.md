Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains at least one integer, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, and if `num` is less than 1, the conditions remain as described. Additionally, `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`**
