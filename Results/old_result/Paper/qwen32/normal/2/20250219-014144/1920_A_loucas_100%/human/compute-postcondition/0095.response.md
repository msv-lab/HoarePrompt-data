The code snippet provided decrements the value of the variable `num` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `less`, `big`, `no`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains at least one integer, `i` is the next element in `no` after the current `i`, `num` is decreased by 1.**
