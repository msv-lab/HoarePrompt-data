Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is [a] if `x` is 2, `big` is [a] if `x` is 1, and `no` is [a] if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. `num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `iterable` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, and `a` is the second integer from the input.**
