The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is [], `big` is [], `no` is [a], `num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `a` is the second integer from the input**.
