Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` was not 1, and `innerLoop` remains unchanged. If `num` is less than 1, the condition holds true as specified.**
