To determine the output of the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly influence the calculation of `num` in this context.
   - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). This variable represents the number of elements in the list of integers.
   - `less`: A list containing all integers `a` where `x` was 2.
   - `big`: A list containing all integers `a` where `x` was 1.
   - `no`: A list containing all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.
   
2. **Calculation of `num`**:
   - `num` is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{num} = (\text{min}(less) - \text{max}(big) + 1) - \text{count of elements in } no \text{ that are between } \text{max}(big) \text{ and } \text{min}(less) \text{ inclusive}
     \]
   - Let's denote:
     - `min_less = min(less)`
     - `max_big = max(big)`
     - `count_no_in_range = \text{count of elements in } no \text{ that are between } max_big \text{ and } min_less \text{ inclusive}`
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{num} = (min_less - max_big + 1) - count_no_in_range
     \]

Given the above breakdown, the exact value of `num` depends on the specific values in the lists `less`, `big`, and `no`. Since the exact values of these lists are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `num`.

However, we can describe the value of `num` precisely based on the given information:

- `min_less` is the smallest integer in the list `less`.
- `max_big` is the largest integer in the list `big`.
- `count_no_in_range` is the number of integers in the list `no` that fall within the range from `max_big` to `min_less` inclusive.

Thus, the output of the `print(num)` statement will be the result of the formula described above.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as (min(less) - max(big) + 1) - count of elements in no that are between max(big) and min(less) inclusive)**
