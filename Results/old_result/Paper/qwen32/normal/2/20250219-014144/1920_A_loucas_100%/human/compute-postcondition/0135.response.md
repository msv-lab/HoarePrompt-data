Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and `num` is less than 1, `iterable` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` was not 1, `innerLoop` is the same as initially.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
