Given the initial state, let's break down the context and determine what will be printed:

- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- At the current index `i`, the element `a[i - 1]` is greater than the element `a[i]`.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`.
- Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both).
- `new_all` is `True` if `new[i - 1] <= new[i]` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(new)`, otherwise `False`.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the content of the string being printed. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
