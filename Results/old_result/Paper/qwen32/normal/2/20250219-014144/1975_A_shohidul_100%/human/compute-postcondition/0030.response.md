Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; `i` is 4. If `a[3] > a[4]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from index 4 to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[3] <= a[4]`, none of the additional variables (`new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) are defined or modified.**
