Given the initial state, let's break down the conditions and variables:

- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is False.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, indicating that the list `a` is not non-decreasing at index `i`.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are non-decreasing.
- Either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

From the initial state, it is clear that the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or conditions that alter this output based on the given information.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
