Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the specified operation. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be split and rearranged to be sorted is flawed.

The program checks if there exists a point where the array can be split into two parts such that the first part's last element is greater than the second part's first element, and then checks if the second part is sorted and if the first element of the second part is less than or equal to all elements of the first part. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted by swapping the two parts.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`. The program would incorrectly identify that the array cannot be sorted because it finds `3 > 1`, but the correct way to sort this array would be to split it into `[3, 1]` and `[2, 4, 5]`, then swap them to get `[2, 4, 5, 3, 1]`, and then split again into `[2, 4, 5]` and `[3, 1]`, and swap them to get `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is not sorted. However, the correct split and swap would be to split into `[3, 1, 2]` and `[4, 5]`, then swap them to get `[4, 5, 3, 1, 2]`, and then split into `[4, 5]` and `[3, 1, 2]`, and swap them to get `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is not sorted either. But the correct final split and swap would be to split into `[3, 1]` and `[2, 4, 5]`, then swap them to get `[2, 4, 5, 3, 1]`, and then split into `[2]` and `[4, 5, 3, 1]`, and swap them to get `[4, 5, 3, 1, 2]`, and then split into `[4, 5]` and `[3, 1, 2]`, and swap them to get `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is not sorted either. The correct final split and swap would be to split into `[3]` and `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, then swap them to get `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]`, which is sorted.

The correct approach involves finding the longest non-decreasing prefix and checking if the rest of the array can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence when concatenated with the prefix. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the correct split points and verify the sorted condition after swapping.
