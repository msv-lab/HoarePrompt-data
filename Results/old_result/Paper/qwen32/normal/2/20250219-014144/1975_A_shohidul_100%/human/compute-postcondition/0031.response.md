The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5. Since `n` is greater than 1, as long as `n` remains greater than 5, the loop can continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; `i` is 5**.
