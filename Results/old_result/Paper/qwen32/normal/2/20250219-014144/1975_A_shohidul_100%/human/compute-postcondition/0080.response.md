Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 4 to the end, `check_all_new` indicates whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` indicates whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. Regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
