The code snippet creates a new list `new` that contains all elements of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. Given that `i` is 3, `new` will include all elements of `a` from index 3 onwards.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 3 to the end.**
