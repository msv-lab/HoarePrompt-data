The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `_`.

Given that `t` is greater than or equal to 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False; `_` is 1 (or whatever the current value of `_` was plus 1)**

Since `_` is a throwaway variable and its exact value isn't specified in the problem description, we can assume it starts from 0 and is incremented each time the loop runs. Therefore, if the loop just finished an iteration, `_` would now be 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False; `_` is 1**
