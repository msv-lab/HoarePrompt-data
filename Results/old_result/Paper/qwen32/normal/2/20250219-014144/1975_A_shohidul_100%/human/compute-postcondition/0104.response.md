The given code checks if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by using the `all` function combined with a list comprehension that compares each element in `new` with the next one.

Given the initial state, the only variable that gets updated is `new_all`. This variable will be `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the following element, indicating that `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it will be `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**
