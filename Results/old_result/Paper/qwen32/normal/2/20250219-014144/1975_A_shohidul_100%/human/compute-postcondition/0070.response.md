Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the condition being true or false. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
