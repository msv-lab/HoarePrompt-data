The provided initial state sets up several conditions and variables, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `check_all` is set to `False`.
   - `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
   - `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list.
   - `check_all_new` is set to `True`.
   - `new_all` is set to `True`.
   - All elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and non-decreasing.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
