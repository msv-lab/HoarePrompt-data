The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `_`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is mentioned that `t` is greater than or equal to 2. However, this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `n`:** This is described as a new input integer. Again, it is not used in the `print` statement.
3. **List `a`:** This is a new list of integers obtained from the input. This list is also not used in the `print` statement.
4. **Boolean `check_all`:** This variable is set to `True` if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise it is `False`. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
5. **Variable `_`:** This variable is set to 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

Given that the `print` statement only outputs the string `'YES'`, the values of the other variables do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
