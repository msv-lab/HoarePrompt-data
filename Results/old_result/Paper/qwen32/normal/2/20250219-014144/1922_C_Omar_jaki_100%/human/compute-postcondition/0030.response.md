To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `b` is a list with `2 * (n - 1)` elements.
- `u` is a truthy value greater than 0 or 0 (though `u` is not used in the print statement).
- `c` is the first value returned by `r()`.
- `d` is the second value returned by `r()`.
- If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Indices Calculation**:
   - `c * 2 - 1`: This expression calculates an index into the list `b`. Since `c` is a value returned by `r()`, it must be a valid index after applying this formula.
   - `d * 2 - 1`: Similarly, this expression calculates another index into the list `b`.

2. **List Access**:
   - `b[c * 2 - 1]`: This accesses the element at the index `c * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.
   - `b[d * 2 - 1]`: This accesses the element at the index `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

3. **Subtraction**:
   - The code subtracts the element at index `d * 2 - 1` from the element at index `c * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the result of the subtraction `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`. Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the elements of `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are values returned by r(), and b is a list with 2 * (n - 1) elements)**
