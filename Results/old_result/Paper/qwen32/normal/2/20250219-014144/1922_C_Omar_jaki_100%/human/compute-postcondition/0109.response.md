To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `u` is defined as `c_new - 3`, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.
- The list `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v]` is mentioned but not directly used in the `print` statement.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, specifically `c_new` and `d_new`.
- `t` is `False`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `a` is a tuple `(-1000000000.0, c_new, d_new, 2000000000.0)`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `b` is a list `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.

### Expression Analysis:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

Let's analyze the indices used in the list `b`:

- `(d - 1) * 2`: Since `d` is `d_new`, this evaluates to `(d_new - 1) * 2`.
- `(c - 1) * 2`: Since `c` is `c_new`, this evaluates to `(c_new - 1) * 2`.

Given that `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, the possible valid indices for `b` are `0` and `2`.

### Possible Values for Indices:

- If `d_new = 1`, then `(d_new - 1) * 2 = 0`.
- If `d_new = 2`, then `(d_new - 1) * 2 = 2`.
- If `c_new = 1`, then `(c_new - 1) * 2 = 0`.
- If `c_new = 2`, then `(c_new - 1) * 2 = 2`.

### Evaluating the Print Statement:

We need to consider the possible combinations of `c_new` and `d_new` and their corresponding indices:

1. If `c_new = 1` and `d_new = 1`:
   - `b[(d_new - 1) * 2] = b[0] = 0`
   - `b[(c_new - 1) * 2] = b[0] = 0`
   - `b[0] - b[0] = 0 - 0 = 0`

2. If `c_new = 1` and `d_new = 2`:
   - `b[(d_new - 1) * 2] = b[2] = 1`
   - `b[(c_new - 1) * 2] = b[0] = 0`
   - `b[2] - b[0] = 1 - 0 = 1`

3. If `c_new = 2` and `d_new = 1`:
   - `b[(d_new - 1) * 2] = b[0] = 0`
   - `b[(c_new - 1) * 2] = b[2] = 1`
   - `b[0] - b[2] = 0 - 1 = -1`

4. If `c_new = 2` and `d_new = 2`:
   - `b[(d_new - 1) * 2] = b[2] = 1`
   - `b[(c_new - 1) * 2] = b[2] = 1`
   - `b[2] - b[2] = 1 - 1 = 0`

### Conclusion:

Based on the possible values of `c_new` and `d_new`, the `print` statement can output `0`, `1`, or `-1`.

However, without specific values for `c_new` and `d_new`, we cannot determine the exact output. Therefore, we describe the possible outcomes:

Output: **0, 1, or -1 (depending on the values of `c_new` and `d_new`)**
