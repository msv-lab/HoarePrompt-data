To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `u` is 2.
- The list `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v]`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `b`**: The list `b` contains specific elements based on the variables `x`, `y`, and `v`. The list is structured as follows:
   - `b[0] = 0`
   - `b[1] = 0`
   - `b[2] = y - x`
   - `b[3] = y - x`
   - `b[4] = y - x + v`
   - `b[5] = y - x + v`
   - `b[6] = y - x + v`

2. **Indices Calculation**:
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` calculates the index in the list `b` for the element corresponding to `d`.
   - Similarly, the expression `(c - 1) * 2` calculates the index in the list `b` for the element corresponding to `c`.

3. **Values of `c` and `d`**:
   - Since `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, their exact values are not specified. However, we know they must be integers because they are used in indexing.

4. **Indexing and Subtraction**:
   - The code subtracts the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2`.
   - Given the structure of the list `b`, the possible values for these indices are 0, 2, 4, and 6.

### Possible Outcomes:
- If both `c` and `d` result in the same index (e.g., both `c` and `d` are 1, resulting in index 0), the subtraction will yield `0`.
- If `c` and `d` result in different indices, the subtraction will depend on the specific values of `y`, `x`, and `v`:
  - For example, if `c` results in index 0 (i.e., `c = 1`) and `d` results in index 2 (i.e., `d = 2`), the subtraction will be `b[2] - b[0] = (y - x) - 0 = y - x`.
  - If `c` results in index 4 (i.e., `c = 3`) and `d` results in index 6 (i.e., `d = 4`), the subtraction will be `b[6] - b[4] = (y - x + v) - (y - x + v) = 0`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `c` and `d`, we can only describe the output in terms of the possible values it can take based on the structure of the list `b`.

Output: **`b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` (where `b` is the list `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v]`, and `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, resulting in indices 0, 2, 4, or 6 in the list `b`)**
