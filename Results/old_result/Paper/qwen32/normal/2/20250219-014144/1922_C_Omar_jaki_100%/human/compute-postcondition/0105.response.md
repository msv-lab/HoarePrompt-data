Postcondition: **`u` is `c_new - 2` where `c_new` must be greater than 1, the list remains `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v]`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()` in this iteration (`c_new` and `d_new`), `t` is `False`, `a` is `(-1000000000.0, c_new, d_new, 2000000000.0)`, `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`. The value of `c` relative to `d` does not affect the state of the variables as the postcondition remains identical in both the if and else parts.**
