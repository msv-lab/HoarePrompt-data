To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `u` is set to 2.
- There is a list `b` with the following elements: `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v]`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the List `b`:**
   - The list `b` contains 7 elements: 
     - `b[0] = 0`
     - `b[1] = 0`
     - `b[2] = y - x`
     - `b[3] = y - x`
     - `b[4] = y - x + v`
     - `b[5] = y - x + v`
     - `b[6] = y - x + v`

2. **Indices Calculation:**
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1]` means we need to find the element at the index `c * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.
   - Similarly, `b[d * 2 - 1]` means we need to find the element at the index `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

3. **Possible Values of Indices:**
   - Since `c` and `d` are returned by `r()`, their exact values are not provided. However, they must be such that `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` result in valid indices for the list `b` (i.e., between 0 and 6 inclusive).

4. **Element Values at Calculated Indices:**
   - Depending on the values of `c` and `d`, the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` could point to any of the elements in the list `b`.
   - For example:
     - If `c = 1`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 1`, so `b[c * 2 - 1] = b[1] = 0`.
     - If `d = 3`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 5`, so `b[d * 2 - 1] = b[5] = y - x + v`.

5. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will subtract the value at index `d * 2 - 1` from the value at index `c * 2 - 1`.
   - Given the possible values of the elements in `b`, the output will depend on the specific values of `c` and `d`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements in the list `b` and the indices derived from `c` and `d`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where b is the list [0, 0, y - x, y - x, y - x + v, y - x + v, y - x + v], c and d are the values returned by r())**
