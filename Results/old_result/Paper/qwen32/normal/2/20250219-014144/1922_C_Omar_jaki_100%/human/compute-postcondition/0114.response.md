Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the unique positions of the cities, an integer `m` representing the number of queries, and for each query, two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the indices of two different cities. The function processes these inputs and returns the closest city to each pair of cities specified by the queries.**
