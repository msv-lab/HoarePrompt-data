To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `b` is a list with `2 * (n - 1)` elements.
   - `u` is the initial truthy value decreased by 1 (though `u` is not used in the print statement).
   - `c` is the first value returned by `r()` and is less than `d`, which is the second value returned by `r()`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `c` and `d` are indices derived from the function `r()`, where `c < d`.
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` gives us the index in the list `b` corresponding to the second element of the `d`-th pair.
   - Similarly, `(c - 1) * 2` gives us the index in the list `b` corresponding to the second element of the `c`-th pair.
   - The print statement computes the difference between these two elements in the list `b`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the elements of `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - The output will be the difference between the elements at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Therefore, the final output is described as follows:

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where c and d are values returned by r(), c < d, and b is a list with 2 * (n - 1) elements)**
