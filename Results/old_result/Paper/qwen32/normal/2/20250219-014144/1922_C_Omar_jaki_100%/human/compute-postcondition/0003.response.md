Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
