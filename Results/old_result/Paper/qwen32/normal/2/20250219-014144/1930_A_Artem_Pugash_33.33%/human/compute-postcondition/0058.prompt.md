Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `numCases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized by the loop, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimums of all pairs of numbers that were originally in `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is [], `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers that were originally in `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, numCases is greater than or equal to 1, i is incremented by 1, numInteger is the integer value provided by the user input, numbers is [], suma is the sum of the minimum of each pair of numbers that were originally in numbers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
