Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` has reached the value of `numCases`, `numInteger` holds the integer value from the last iteration's user input, `numbers` is [], `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers that were originally in `numbers` for the last iteration. The loop has completed all its iterations and printed the `suma` for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within its initial bounds, `numCases` remains unchanged, `i` equals `numCases` indicating all iterations are complete, `numInteger` contains the last input integer, `numbers` is an empty list as all elements have been processed, and `suma` contains the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers from the last test case. The loop has finished executing and has printed the result for each test case.
