The code snippet `suma += min(a, b)` adds the minimum value between `a` and `b` to the current value of `suma`. Given that `suma` was initially set to `min(a, b)`, after executing this line, `suma` will effectively be `min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, which simplifies to `2 * min(a, b)`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized by the loop, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of substrings from the user input in ascending order (with the first two elements removed), `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.**
