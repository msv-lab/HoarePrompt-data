To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop will continue as long as `numbers` is not an empty list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is initialized by the loop
- `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input
- `numbers` is a sorted list of substrings from the user input in ascending order (with the first two elements removed)
- `suma` is `min(a, b)`
- `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`
- `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`

The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `numbers` must not be an empty list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `numbers` contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized by the loop, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of substrings from the user input in ascending order (with the first two elements removed), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`**
