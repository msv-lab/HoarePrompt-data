The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000, which is not affected by this code snippet. Similarly, the details about `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` remain unchanged because they are not referenced or modified in the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000; `numCases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
