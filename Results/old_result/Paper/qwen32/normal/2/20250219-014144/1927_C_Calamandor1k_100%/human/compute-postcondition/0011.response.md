The given code snippet is simply `continue`. This statement is used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables are modified, and the state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string `'NO'`, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of unique integers from `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of unique integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is the set difference `relevant_a - relevant_b`, `only_b` is the set difference `relevant_b - relevant_a`, `both` is the set intersection `relevant_a & relevant_b`. Additionally, the length of `only_a` is greater than k // 2.**
