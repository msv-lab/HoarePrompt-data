t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in the list `cases` is a tuple containing three parts: (1) a tuple of three integers (n, m, k) where 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), and k is even; (2) a list of n integers representing array a where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; (3) a list of m integers representing array b where each element b_j satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.
