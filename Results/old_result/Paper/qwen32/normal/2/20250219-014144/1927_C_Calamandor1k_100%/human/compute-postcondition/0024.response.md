The given Python code creates a set `unique_a` from the list `a`. This operation removes any duplicate elements from `a` and stores the unique elements in `unique_a`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the creation of the new variable `unique_a`, which contains the unique elements of the list `a_next`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next) where n_next and m_next are integers such that 1 ≤ n_next, m_next ≤ 2·10^5, k_next is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k_next ≤ 2·min(n_next, m_next), a_next is a list of n_next integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b_next is a list of m_next integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements of `a_next`.**
