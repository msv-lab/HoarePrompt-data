The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple includes integers `n` and `m` indicating the lengths of two lists, an even integer `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, the function evaluates whether certain conditions related to the elements of lists `a` and `b` and the value of `k` are met. It returns a list of `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, based on these evaluations.
