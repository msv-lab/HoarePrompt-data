The given Python code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `total_distinct`). The only change is that `results` now contains an additional element `'YES'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`, and the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` is the next item in `cases` to be processed; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `results` contains an additional element `'YES'`.**
