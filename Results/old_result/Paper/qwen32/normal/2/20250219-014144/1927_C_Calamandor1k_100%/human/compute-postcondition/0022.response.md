The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. This means that the previous condition where `total_distinct` was less than `k` no longer holds true, and the new value added to `results` reflects a different outcome.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of unique integers from `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of unique integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is the set difference `relevant_a - relevant_b`, `only_b` is the set difference `relevant_b - relevant_a`, `both` is the set intersection `relevant_a & relevant_b`. The length of `only_b` is not greater than k // 2, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct` is less than k, `results` contains the string `'NO'`. However, in this case, `results` now contains the string `'YES'`.**
