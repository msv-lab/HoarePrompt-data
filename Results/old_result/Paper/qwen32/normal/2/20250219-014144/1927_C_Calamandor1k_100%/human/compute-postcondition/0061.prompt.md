Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three parts: (1) a tuple (n, m, k) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5 and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m); (2) a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; (3) a list b of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, m, k, a, b in cases:
    unique_a = set(a)
    unique_b = set(b)
    relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
    relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
    only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
    only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
    both = relevant_a & relevant_b
    if len(only_a) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if len(only_b) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
    if total_distinct < k:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of unique integers from `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of unique integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is the set difference `relevant_a - relevant_b`, `only_b` is the set difference `relevant_b - relevant_a`, `both` is the set intersection `relevant_a & relevant_b`. The length of `only_b` is not greater than k // 2, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct` is less than k, `results` contains the string `'NO'`. However, in this case, `results` now contains the string `'YES'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next) where n_next and m_next are integers such that 1 ≤ n_next, m_next ≤ 2·10^5, k_next is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k_next ≤ 2·min(n_next, m_next), a_next is a list of n_next integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b_next is a list of m_next integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements of `a_next`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements of `b_next`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` which are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` which are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` which are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` which are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. If the length of `only_b` is greater than k // 2, `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` followed by the string `'NO'`. Otherwise, `results` remains as `'YES'`. `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, `results` now includes `'NO'` as its last element. Additionally, `results` now includes `'YES'` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`, and the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` is the next item in `cases` to be processed; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `results` contains an additional element `'YES'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
