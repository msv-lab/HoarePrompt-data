Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and currently `n` is equal to `k`, we need to determine what the following Python code will print:

```python
print(1)
```

Let's analyze the code:

- The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the number `1`.

The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the execution of this particular print statement because it does not reference these variables. It simply prints the constant value `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
