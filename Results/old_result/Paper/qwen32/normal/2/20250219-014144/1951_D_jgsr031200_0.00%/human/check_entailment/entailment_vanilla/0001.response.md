Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with different prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on.

### Key Points:

1. **Constraints**: 
   - Number of test cases (`t`) can be up to 1000.
   - `n` and `k` can be as large as \(10^{18}\).
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If possible, provide the number of stalls and their respective prices.

### Code Analysis:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem but seems to have several issues:

1. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is called inside the loop but is not defined within the provided code snippet.

2. **Logic for Setting Prices**:
   - The logic for setting prices is incomplete and incorrect.
   - The code tries to use a greedy approach but fails to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The current implementation only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is insufficient to guarantee the solution for all cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case when `n == k` by setting a single stall with a price of `1`.
   - It also correctly identifies when `n < k` as impossible.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem, we can use a strategy that involves setting up stalls with decreasing prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One effective way is to use powers of 2 as prices, which allows us to cover a wide range of values efficiently.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Try to use powers of 2 as prices
    prices = []
    remaining_k = k
    remaining_n = n
    power = 0
    
    while remaining_k > 0 and power < 60:
        price = 2 ** power
        if price > remaining_n:
            break
        count = min(remaining_k, remaining_n // price)
        if count > 0:
            prices.append(price)
            remaining_k -= count
            remaining_n -= count * price
        power += 1
    
    if remaining_k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(prices))
        print(*prices)
    else:
        print('NO')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases due to insufficient logic for setting up the stall prices. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
