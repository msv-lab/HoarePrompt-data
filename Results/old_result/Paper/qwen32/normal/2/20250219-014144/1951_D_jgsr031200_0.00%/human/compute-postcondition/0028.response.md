Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list containing \([n - k + 1, 1]\). Given `n` is 0, this simplifies to \([-k + 1, 1]\).
- `h` is calculated as \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\). Substituting `n` as 0, this becomes \(0 // (-k + 1) + 0 = 0\).
- `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- It is also mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, but based on our calculation, `h` is 0, which contradicts this condition. However, since the print statement does not depend on any of these variables, we can ignore this discrepancy for the purpose of determining the output.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2`. None of the variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, `i`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(2)` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
