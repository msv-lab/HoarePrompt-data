Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list containing \([n - k + 1, 1]\). Since `n` is 0, this simplifies to \([-k + 1, 1]\).
- `h` is calculated as \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\). Substituting `n = 0`, we get \(0 // (-k + 1) + 0 = 0\).
- `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- It is mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, but from our calculation, `h` is 0, which contradicts this condition. However, since the task is to determine what is printed and not to validate the conditions, we will proceed with the given print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
