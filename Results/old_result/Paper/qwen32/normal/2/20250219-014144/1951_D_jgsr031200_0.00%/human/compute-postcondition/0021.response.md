The given code snippet updates the value of `curr` to `n // i`. Given the initial state, `n` is 0 and `i` is 1. Therefore, `curr` will be updated to `0 // 1`, which is 0.

The other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // k + n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**.
