Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Stall Prices**: The program attempts to use a hardcoded approach for determining stall prices, which does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the logic used in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not consider all possible configurations of stall prices.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is much larger than `k`, the program might not be able to find a suitable configuration of stall prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output Format**: Even when the program finds a solution, it does not format the output correctly. For instance, if the program determines that `YES` is the correct answer, it should print the number of stalls followed by the prices, but the current implementation incorrectly prints `YES` before the number of stalls.

4. **General Approach**: A more systematic approach is needed to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One way to achieve this is to use a greedy strategy where we start with the highest possible price and decrease it until we reach the desired number of jewels. However, the current implementation does not follow such a strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    remaining_coins = n
    
    # Try to maximize the number of stalls by setting prices from high to low
    for price in range(n, 0, -1):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        if remaining_coins < price:
            continue
        
        # Calculate how many jewels Alice can buy at this price
        jewels_bought = remaining_coins // price
        if jewels_bought >= remaining_jewels:
            stalls.append(price * remaining_jewels)
            remaining_jewels = 0
        else:
            stalls.append(price * jewels_bought)
            remaining_jewels -= jewels_bought
            remaining_coins -= price * jewels_bought
    
    if remaining_jewels == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
    else:
        print('NO')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version attempts to set up stalls with decreasing prices and checks if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels. If it succeeds, it prints the number of stalls and their prices; otherwise, it prints "NO".
