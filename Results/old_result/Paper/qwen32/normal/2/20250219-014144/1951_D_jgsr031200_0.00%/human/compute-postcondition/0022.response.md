The value of `h` is updated by adding the value of `curr` to it. Given that `curr` is 0, the value of `h` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // k + n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**
