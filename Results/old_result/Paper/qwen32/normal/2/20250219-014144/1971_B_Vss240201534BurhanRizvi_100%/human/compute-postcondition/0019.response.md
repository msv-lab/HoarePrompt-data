In this task, the initial state provides information about two variables, `t` and `s`. Specifically:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000 inclusive.
- `s` is a string input by the user.

However, the Python code snippet provided is simply:
```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `s`. It directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not involve any computation or reference to the variables `t` or `s`.

Output: **No**
