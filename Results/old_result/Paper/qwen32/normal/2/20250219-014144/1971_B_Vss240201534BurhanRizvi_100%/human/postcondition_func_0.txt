The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It then determines if the string can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string is of length 1 or consists of identical characters, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" and a rearranged version of the string that is different from the original.
