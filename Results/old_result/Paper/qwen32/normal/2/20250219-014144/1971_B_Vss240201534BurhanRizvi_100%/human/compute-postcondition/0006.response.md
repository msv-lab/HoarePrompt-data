Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
  - `s` is a string with a length greater than 1 where all characters in `s` are identical.

- **Python Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('No')
  ```

From the initial state, we know the values of `t` and `s`, but they do not affect the execution of the `print` statement because the statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'No'`.

Output: **No**
