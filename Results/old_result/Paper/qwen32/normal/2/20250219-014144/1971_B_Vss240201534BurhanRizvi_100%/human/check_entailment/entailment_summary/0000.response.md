### Reasoning:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be rearranged to form a different string and outputs "NO".

2. **Strings with Identical Characters**: For strings where all characters are identical (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program also correctly identifies that no rearrangement can result in a different string and outputs "NO".

3. **Other Strings**: For strings that do not fall into the above two categories, the program attempts to create a different permutation using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. If the generated permutation (`s2`) is the same as the original string (`s`), it falls back to a simple rotation (`s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that the output is always a different string from the input.

4. **Randomness and Determinism**: While the use of `random.sample` introduces randomness, the fallback mechanism ensures that a valid rearrangement is always produced when possible. This means that the program adheres to the problem requirements even if the initial random attempt fails.

5. **Output Format**: The program consistently outputs "YES" followed by a rearranged string when a valid rearrangement is possible, and "NO" when it is not. The format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases according to the problem description and execution summary.

**Correctness:** **True**
