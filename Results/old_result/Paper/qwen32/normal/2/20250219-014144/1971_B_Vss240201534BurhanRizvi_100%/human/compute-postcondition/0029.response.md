The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `s` is the string input by the user.

2. **Analyze the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('No')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement does not reference any variables (`t` or `s`), the output is simply the string `'No'`.

Based on this analysis, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **No**
