The code updates the `max_profit` variable to be the maximum of its current value and the `profit_mid` value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`; `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**.
