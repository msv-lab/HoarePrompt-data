Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison of `profit_next` and `profit_mid`: if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`. `mid` is recalculated as `(min(n, b)) // 2` in both cases. `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively. `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_next)` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_mid)`.**
