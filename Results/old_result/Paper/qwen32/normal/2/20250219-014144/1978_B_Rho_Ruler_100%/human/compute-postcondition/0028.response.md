To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop is performing a binary search to find the maximum profit value by evaluating the function `func_1` at different points between `low` and `high`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low` starts at 0.
   - `high` starts at `min(n, b)`.
   - `max_profit` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `mid` as the midpoint between `low` and `high`.
   - It computes `profit_mid` and `profit_next` using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, respectively.
   - It updates `max_profit` to the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`.
   - Depending on whether `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it adjusts `low` or `high` to narrow down the search range.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, meaning the search space has been fully explored.

4. **Final State**:
   - At the end of the loop, `low` will be greater than `high`.
   - `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit found during the search.

Given the nature of the binary search, the final state will be when `low` is one more than `high`, and `max_profit` will be the highest profit value found.

### Final Output State

- `low` will be greater than `high`.
- `max_profit` will be the maximum profit value found.

Let's assume the loop has completed all iterations and the final values are `low = X + 1` and `high = X`, where `X` is the last midpoint evaluated before the loop terminated. The exact values of `low` and `high` depend on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` and the behavior of `func_1`.

**Output State: low = X + 1, high = X, max_profit = maximum profit found.**

Since the exact values of `X` and the maximum profit depend on the input values and the function `func_1`, we can't provide specific numerical values without knowing those details. However, the format and the understanding of the state are clear.

Output State: **low = X + 1, high = X, max_profit = maximum profit found.**
