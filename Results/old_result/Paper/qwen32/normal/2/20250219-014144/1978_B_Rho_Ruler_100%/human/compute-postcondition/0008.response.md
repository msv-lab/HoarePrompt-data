The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is `mid + 1`; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. The current value of `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`; `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_next)`**
