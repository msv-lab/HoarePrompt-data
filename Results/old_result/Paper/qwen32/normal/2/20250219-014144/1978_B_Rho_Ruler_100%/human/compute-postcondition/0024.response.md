The given code snippet updates the `max_profit` variable by comparing its current value with `profit_mid`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` remain unchanged.

Since `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`, the new value of `max_profit` will be the greater of these two values.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`; If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
