Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than `high`. `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
