Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is less than `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively; `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_next)` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_mid)`**

Explanation: The value of `mid` is now calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
