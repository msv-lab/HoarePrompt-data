### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling `n` buns under specific conditions. The profit depends on how many buns (`k`) are sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins for the first `k` buns, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - The `func_2` function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `min(n, b)`, because `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n` or the maximum possible modified price `b`.
   
2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     This formula accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-k+1)` and adds the profit from the remaining `(n-k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range `[low, high]` to find the `k` that gives the maximum profit.
   - At each step, it compares the profit at the midpoint `mid` with the profit at `mid + 1`. If the profit at `mid + 1` is higher, it moves the `low` boundary up; otherwise, it moves the `high` boundary down.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, at which point `max_profit` holds the maximum profit found.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k = 0` (all buns sold at the usual price) and when `k = n` (all buns sold at the modified price).
   - The use of binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of `n` and `b` (up to \(10^9\)).

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by leveraging binary search and an efficient profit calculation formula. It handles all specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.
