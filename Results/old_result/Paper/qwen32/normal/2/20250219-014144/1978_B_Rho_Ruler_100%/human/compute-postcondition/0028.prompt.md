Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison of `profit_next` and `profit_mid`: if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`. `mid` is recalculated as `(min(n, b)) // 2` in both cases. `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively. `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_next)` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_mid)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than `high`. `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
