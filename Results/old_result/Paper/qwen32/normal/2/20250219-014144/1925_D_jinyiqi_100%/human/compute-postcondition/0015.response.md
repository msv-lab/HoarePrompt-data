Output State: **sum_f is the cumulative sum of all f values read over m iterations, and j is equal to m; cn2 is calculated as n * (n - 1) // 2.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `cn2` is now calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The values of `sum_f` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
