To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state:

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`: First input integer.
- `m`: Second input integer.
- `k`: Third input integer.
- `sum_f`: Sum of all `f` values read during `m` iterations.
- `j`: Equal to `m`.
- `cn2`: Calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `p`: Calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q`: Calculated as `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
- `gcd`: Greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`cn2` Calculation**:
   - `cn2` is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

2. **`p` Calculation**:
   - `p` is computed using the formula `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
   - This involves multiplying several terms and then dividing by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `p` and `q`.

3. **`q` Calculation**:
   - `q` is computed using the formula `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`.
   - This involves multiplying `2` with `cn2` and then dividing by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `p` and `q`.

4. **`gcd` Calculation**:
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - This ensures that `p` and `q` are simplified to their lowest terms.

5. **Modular Inverse and Final Calculation**:
   - `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M`.
   - The expression `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` calculates the result of `p` divided by `q` modulo `M`.

### Output:
The final output is the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, which is an integer value.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the calculations involved, the output will be the integer result of the expression `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`.

Output: **the integer result of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`**
