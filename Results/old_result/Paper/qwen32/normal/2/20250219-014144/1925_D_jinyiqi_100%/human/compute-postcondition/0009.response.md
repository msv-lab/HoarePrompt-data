The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The other variables (`sum_f`, `j`, and `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `sum_f` was already calculated as its previous value plus `f`, and `j` was incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`. These conditions remain unchanged.

After executing the code, `a`, `b`, and `f` will hold the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f`, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.**
