The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f` twice, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`**  
Adjusted State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f` twice, `j` is incremented by 1 (so if it was `k` before, it is now `k+1`), `j` must be less than `m`**

To put it simply:
State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f` twice, `j` is `previous_j + 1`, `j` must be less than `m`**
