To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and formulas used in the code against the problem description and the given examples. Let's break down the steps and verify the correctness systematically.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions.
- **Output**: For each test case, print one integer â€” the answer to the problem, which is \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9+7) \).
- **Constraints**:
  - Multiple test cases (up to \( 5 \times 10^4 \)).
  - \( 2 \le n \le 10^5 \), \( 0 \le m \le \min(10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2}) \), \( 1 \le k \le 2 \times 10^5 \).
  - Sum of \( n \) and \( m \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 10^5 \).
  - Sum of \( k \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input, calculates the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`), computes the numerator (`p`) and denominator (`q`), reduces the fraction by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`), and finally prints the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Key Points:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating `sum_f`**: It sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
3. **Computing `p` and `q`**:
   - `cn2` represents the total number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children, i.e., \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - `p` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - `q` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \).
4. **Reducing the Fraction**: The program divides both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
5. **Modular Inverse and Output**: The program computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using `pow(q, -1, M)` and prints the result.

### Formula Verification:
Let's verify the formula used for `p` and `q`:

- **Numerator (`p`)**:
  - The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} \) accounts for the contribution of the initial friendship values.
  - The term \( m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \) accounts for the additional contributions due to the increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.

- **Denominator (`q`)**:
  - The term \( 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \) represents the total number of ways to choose pairs of children over all possible excursions.

### Edge Cases:
- **No Friend Pairs (`m = 0`)**:
  - Input: `100 0 24`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Single Pair of Friends (`m = 1`)**:
  - Input: `2 1 10` followed by `1 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `55` (Sum of first 10 natural numbers)
  - Program Output: `55` (Correct)

- **Multiple Friend Pairs (`m > 1`)**:
  - Input: `5 2 4` followed by `1 2 25` and `3 2 24`
  - Expected Output: `40000020`
  - Program Output: `40000020` (Correct)

### Detailed Reasoning:
The program correctly handles the following aspects:
- **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- **Sum Calculation**: It correctly calculates the sum of initial friendship values.
- **Fraction Calculation**: The formulas for `p` and `q` seem to be derived correctly based on the problem's requirements.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: It correctly computes the modular inverse and the final result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification against the provided examples and edge cases, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem description.

**Final: True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads input, calculates the required values, and handles various edge cases including no friend pairs and multiple friend pairs. It also efficiently computes the modular inverse and outputs the result as specified.
