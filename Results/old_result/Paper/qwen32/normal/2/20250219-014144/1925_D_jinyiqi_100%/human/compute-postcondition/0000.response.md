Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `m` ≤ min(10^5, `n`(`n`-1)/2), and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9. All pairs (`a_i`, `b_i`) are distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, while all other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`) remain unchanged as they have not been referenced or modified in the provided code snippet.
