Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f` twice, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`.**

Explanation: The value of `sum_f` is updated to be its previous value plus `f` again, as the operation `sum_f += f` is performed. The values of `a`, `b`, `f`, `j`, and the condition that `j` must be less than `m` remain unchanged except for the increment of `j`.
