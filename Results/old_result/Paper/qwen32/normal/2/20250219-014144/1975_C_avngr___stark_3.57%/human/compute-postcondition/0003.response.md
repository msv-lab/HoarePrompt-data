The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` will now hold the list of integers provided by the input.

Given the initial state, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `a` is updated to reflect the new list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\), as provided by the input.**
