Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than 4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `i` is 4; `max` is `min(a[4], a[3])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `max` is now set to the smaller of the two values `a[4]` and `a[3]`. All other variables retain their original values.
