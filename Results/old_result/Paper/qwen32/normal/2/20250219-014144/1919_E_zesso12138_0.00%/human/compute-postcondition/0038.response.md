Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, where at least one element `dp[j]` is greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `j - 1 >= 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, `new_dp` remains unchanged from its initial state of all zeros.**
