To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it correctly counts the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

### Key Components:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - offset` after considering some elements of array `a`.
   - `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices by shifting them into a positive range.
   - The transition from `dp` to `new_dp` considers adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input data, processes each test case using `func_1`, and collects results.
   - `func_1` computes the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum `p[-1]` using dynamic programming.

### Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The initial state `dp[offset] = 1` correctly represents the starting point with a prefix sum of `0`.
- **Transition**: The transitions `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` correctly account for adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
- **Final State**: The final state `dp[final_sum]` where `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` correctly represents the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum `p[-1]`.

However, there are a few critical points to consider:
- **Constraints Handling**: The program assumes that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `5000`, which is within the problem constraints.
- **Modulo Operation**: The results are taken modulo `998,244,353` as required.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like `n = 1` and `p` containing only `0`, `1`, or `-1`.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and produces the expected outputs for the provided examples.
