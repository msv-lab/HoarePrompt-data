The only object in the loop head is the variable `res`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list after the current `res`.

At the end of the last iteration, `res` held the third element of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least four elements, and `res` should now hold the fourth element.

State: **`n` is the size of the last array `p` processed, `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least four elements (e.g., `results` is `[some_value1, some_value2, some_value3, some_value4]`), `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, `res` is the fourth element of `results`**
