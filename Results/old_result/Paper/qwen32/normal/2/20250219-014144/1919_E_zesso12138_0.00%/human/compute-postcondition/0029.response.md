To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `n` is the size of the last array `p` processed.
- `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`, where `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `results` is `[some_value]`).
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

However, there is a discrepancy in the code snippet provided. The `print` statement is `print(res)`, but the variable `res` is not mentioned in the initial state. It seems like there might be a typo, and the intended variable to be printed could be `result`.

Assuming the intention is to print `result`, here's the analysis:

- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

Since the exact value returned by `func_1(n, p)` is not specified, we can only describe it based on the given information.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, p) from the last iteration)**

If the intention was indeed to print `res`, and `res` is supposed to hold some value related to the computation, we would need more information about `res`. Given the current information, we can only assume `res` is a typo for `result`.

Therefore, the most precise answer based on the provided information is:

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, p) from the last iteration)**
