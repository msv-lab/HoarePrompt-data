The code snippet `dp = new_dp` assigns the reference of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means `dp` now points to the same list object that `new_dp` points to. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 (but now `dp` points to the same list as `new_dp`); `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
