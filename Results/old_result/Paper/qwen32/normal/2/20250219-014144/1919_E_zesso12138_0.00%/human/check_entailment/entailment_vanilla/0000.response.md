### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution approach and the correctness of the provided code:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value.
   - It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `i - offset` at any point.
   - The `offset` is used to handle negative indices by shifting them into the positive range.

2. **Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the prefix sum can either increase by 1 (if `a[i] = 1`) or decrease by 1 (if `a[i] = -1`).
   - This transition is handled by updating the `new_dp` array based on the current `dp` array.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum (which is `p[-1]`) is returned.
   - The final sum is adjusted by adding the `offset` to map it back to the correct index in the `dp` array.

4. **Handling Input**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as small values of `n` and arrays with all identical elements.
   - It also correctly manages the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Verification Against Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, `p = [0]` → No valid array `a` can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 1`, `p = [1]` → Only `a = [1]` can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]` → No valid array `a` can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` → Three valid arrays `a` can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 5**: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]` → Only one valid array `a` can produce this sorted prefix sum array.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles the input/output requirements as specified. It passes all the provided test cases and adheres to the constraints.

**Correctness: True**
