You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1(n, p)`
- This function calculates the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- It uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value.
- The `offset` variable is used to handle negative indices by shifting them into the positive range.
- The `dp` array is updated for each element in `p`, considering both possible values for the next element in `a` (either `1` or `-1`).

#### Function `func_2()`
- This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- It handles multiple test cases by reading all input at once and processing each test case sequentially.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the problem description:

1. **Initialization and Offset Handling**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to accommodate all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`.
   - The `offset` variable shifts these values to start from index `0` in the `dp` array.

2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - For each position `i` in the prefix sum array `p`, the `dp` array is updated based on the previous state.
   - The update considers both possible next values (`1` and `-1`), ensuring all possible sequences are considered.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final result is obtained from the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads and processes multiple test cases, ensuring the program can handle the input format specified in the problem description.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   1
   0
   Output:
   0
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `0` because there is no way to get a prefix sum of `0` with a single element array `a`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   1
   1
   Output:
   1
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `1` because the only possible array `a` is `[1]`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   3
   -1 1 2
   Output:
   0
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `0` because there is no way to get the prefix sums `[-1, 1, 2]` after sorting.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   5
   -1 0 0 1 1
   Output:
   3
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `3` because there are three possible arrays `a` that can produce the sorted prefix sums `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   5
   -4 -3 -3 -2 -1
   Output:
   1
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `1` because the only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing with the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the problem description for all test cases. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible sequences are considered, and the handling of multiple test cases is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
