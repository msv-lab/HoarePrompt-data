Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`. The absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns the hidden array `a`.**
