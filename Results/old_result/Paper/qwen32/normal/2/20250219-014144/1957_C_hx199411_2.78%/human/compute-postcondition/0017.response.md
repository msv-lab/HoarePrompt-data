The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; if `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4; `i` is 4**
