Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Analysis:

- `t`: An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`: The first integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k`: The second integer read from the input, where \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
- Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, representing the i-th move, with \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\).
- `num`: Calculated as the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.
- `i`: Set to `k + 1`.
- `m`: Calculated as `n - num`, and it is given that `m` equals 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(0)` statement directly outputs the integer `0`. This output is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `num`, `i`, and `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
