The code snippet initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `num`, `i`, or `m`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is `k + 1`; `m` is `n - num`; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
