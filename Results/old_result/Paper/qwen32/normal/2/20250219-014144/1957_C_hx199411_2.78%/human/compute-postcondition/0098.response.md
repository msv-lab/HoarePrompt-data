The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. This means the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the new input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the second input, `r` is the second integer read from the second input, `i` is 2, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r` otherwise 2, `m` is `n - 1` if `c` equals `r` otherwise `n - 2`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.**

In simpler terms, the values of `c` and `r` have been updated to the new integers read from the second input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
