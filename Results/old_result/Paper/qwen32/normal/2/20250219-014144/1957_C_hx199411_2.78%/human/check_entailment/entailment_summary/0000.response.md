### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the number of distinct final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, considering the rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It initializes a counter `num` to keep track of the number of cells affected by the initial `k` moves.
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`:
     - If `r_i == c_i`, it increments `num` by 1 because the move is on the diagonal, and the computer skips its turn.
     - Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 because the move is off the diagonal, and the computer mirrors the move.
   - It calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of free cells left on the board after accounting for the initial moves.
3. **Determining the Result**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no free cells, so the result is `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one free cell, so the result is `1`.
   - For `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining `m` cells. The DP array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations for each number of free cells up to `m`.
     - `dp[1]` is initialized to `1` because there is only one way to place a rook in a single cell.
     - `dp[2]` is initialized to `3` because there are three ways to place two rooks in two cells without them attacking each other.
     - For `m > 2`, the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `i` free cells. This relation considers the placement of the last rook and the configurations of the remaining cells.
4. **Output**: The result for each test case is printed.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the constraints efficiently. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is computed in a reasonable time even for large values of `n`.
