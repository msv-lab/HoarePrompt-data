To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given information. The loop updates the `dp` list using the formula:

\[ \text{dp}[i] = (\text{dp}[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times \text{dp}[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

We are provided with the initial state and the states after the first three iterations. From these, we can infer the pattern and compute the final state up to `m`.

Given:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`
- `dp[3] = 7` (after 1st iteration)
- `dp[4] = 25` (after 2nd iteration)
- `dp[5] = 81` (after 3rd iteration)

Let's continue this process until we reach `dp[m]`.

### Iteration 4:
\[ \text{dp}[6] = (\text{dp}[5] + (6 - 1) \times \text{dp}[4] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[6] = (81 + 5 \times 25 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[6] = (81 + 250) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[6] = 331 \]

### Iteration 5:
\[ \text{dp}[7] = (\text{dp}[6] + (7 - 1) \times \text{dp}[5] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[7] = (331 + 6 \times 81 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[7] = (331 + 972) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[7] = 1303 \]

### Iteration 6:
\[ \text{dp}[8] = (\text{dp}[7] + (8 - 1) \times \text{dp}[6] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[8] = (1303 + 7 \times 331 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[8] = (1303 + 4634) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ \text{dp}[8] = 5937 \]

We continue this process until we reach `dp[m]`. However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `m`, we assume the pattern continues similarly.

### General Pattern:
The loop will continue to update `dp[i]` using the given formula until `i` reaches `m + 1`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the `dp` list will be fully computed up to `dp[m]`. The exact value of `dp[m]` depends on the specific value of `m`, which is determined by the initial conditions (`n` and `k`).

Given the pattern, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is `m + 1`; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula.**

In simpler terms, the final `dp` list will have all its values computed according to the loop formula, and `i` will be `m + 1` after the loop completes.
