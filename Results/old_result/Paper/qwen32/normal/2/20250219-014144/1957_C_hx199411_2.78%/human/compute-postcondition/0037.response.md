The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 3 to `m + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the loop condition `for i in range(3, m + 1)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`. Since `i` is currently 4, it should be incremented to 5 for the next iteration, provided that `m + 1` is greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is 5; `m` is at least 3; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25.**
