The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, so we need to compute `dp[5]`.

Let's substitute the known values into the formula:

- `dp[4]` is 25
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `i` is 5

Using the formula:
\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) \times dp[3] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 4 \times 7 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 56) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is 5; `m` is at least 3; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81.**
