The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, or `dp` described in the initial state. 

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

- `t` is set to 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- `num` is calculated as `2k - count_equal`, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
- `m` is set to 0, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, which means `dp` is a list of length 1. However, `dp[1]` is not defined because `m` is 0.
- The `print` statement simply outputs `0`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
