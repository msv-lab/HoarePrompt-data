The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's denote it as `i_end`). Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `i_end`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_end` from the provided state, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To make it more specific, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. Therefore, we can say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is 3**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate general form would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is 3**.

But the most general answer without assuming a specific value for `i` is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Given the format requirement, we'll use the most specific example where `i` was 2:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is 3**.
