The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `m`, `dp`). The only change is the introduction of the new variables `c` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `i` is `k + 1` if `m == 1`, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula, `c` is the first integer read from the second input pair, `r` is the second integer read from the second input pair`.**
