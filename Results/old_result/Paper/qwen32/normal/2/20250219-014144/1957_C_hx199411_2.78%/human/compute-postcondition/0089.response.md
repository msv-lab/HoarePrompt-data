The given code snippet sets `num` to 0. This affects the value of `num` but does not change the values of other variables like `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, or `dp`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is 0, `i` is either `k` or `m`, `m` is `n - num` and can be 0, 1, or greater than 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1. If `m` is 0, no further updates are made to `dp`.**
