To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's break down the changes:

The line of code modifies the value of `dp[i]` using the formula:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Given:
- `i` is 4.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, all other elements initialized to 0 except `dp[i]` which is calculated using the above formula.

We need to compute `dp[4]`:
- `dp[3]` is 3 (given).
- `dp[2]` is 0 (since it's initialized to 0).

Substitute these values into the formula:
```python
dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = (3 + 3 * 0 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = (3 + 0) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[4] = 3
```

Thus, `dp[4]` is updated to 3.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` must be at least 2, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, the fourth element being 3, all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 4**.
