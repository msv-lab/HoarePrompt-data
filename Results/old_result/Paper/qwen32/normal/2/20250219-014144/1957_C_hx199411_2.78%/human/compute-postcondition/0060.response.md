The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it determines the total number of iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula, `c` and `r` are the integers read from the second input pair. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3.**
