Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1, `c` is the first integer read from the second input, `r` is the second integer read from the second input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
