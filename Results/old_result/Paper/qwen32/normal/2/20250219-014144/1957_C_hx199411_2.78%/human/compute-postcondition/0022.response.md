To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variable `num` changes based on the conditions inside the loop. The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.

Let's break down the provided output states after the first three iterations to understand the pattern:

1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - If `c == r`, `num` becomes 1.
   - If `c != r`, `num` becomes 2.

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - If both iterations had `c == r`, `num` becomes 2.
   - If one iteration had `c == r` and the other had `c != r`, `num` becomes 3.
   - If both iterations had `c != r`, `num` becomes 4.

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - If all three iterations had `c == r`, `num` becomes 3.
   - If two iterations had `c == r` and one had `c != r`, `num` becomes 4.
   - If one iteration had `c == r` and two had `c != r`, `num` becomes 5.
   - If all three iterations had `c != r`, `num` becomes 6.

From these observations, we can generalize that after `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.

Given that the loop runs `k` times, the final value of `num` will be the sum of the increments from each iteration. Since we do not have specific values for `c` and `r` for all `k` iterations, we can only express the final state in terms of `k` and the number of times `c == r`.

However, if we assume the worst-case scenario where all `c != r`, then `num` would be `2 * k`. Conversely, if all `c == r`, then `num` would be `k`. In the general case, `num` will be some integer between `k` and `2 * k`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact sequence of `c` and `r` values, we'll assume the general form where `num` is the sum of the increments based on the given conditions.

Thus, the final output state after all `k` iterations will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is `k + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `num` will be the total increment based on the conditions met during the `k` iterations, and `i` will be `k + 1` indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
