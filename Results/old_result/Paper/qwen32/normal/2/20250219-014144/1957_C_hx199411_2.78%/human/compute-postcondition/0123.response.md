To determine the new value of `dp[i]`, we need to use the given formula:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Given:
- `i` is 5
- `dp[4]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 3

Let's substitute these values into the formula:

\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) \times dp[3] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (3 + 4 \times 3 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = (3 + 24) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 27 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[5] = 27 \]

Thus, the value of `dp[5]` is updated to 27.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the Output State:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` must be at least 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, the fourth element being 3, the fifth element being 27, all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 5**.
