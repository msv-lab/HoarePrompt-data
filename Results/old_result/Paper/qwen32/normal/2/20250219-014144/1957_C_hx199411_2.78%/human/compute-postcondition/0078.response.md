The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k`, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than `m + 1`.

Given that `i` is currently `k`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs `(c, r)` read during the `k` iterations, `i` is `k + 1`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**
