### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify whether it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Mechanics**: 
   - Players alternate turns placing rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Player 1 places white rooks, and Player 2 (computer) places black rooks.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - When Player 1 places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   
2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of distinct final configurations of the board after `k` moves by Player 1 and the corresponding computer moves.
   - Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the positions of the rooks placed by Player 1.

2. **Counting Moves**:
   - The variable `num` keeps track of the number of positions occupied by rooks after `k` moves.
   - If a move places a rook at `(r, c)` where `r == c`, only one rook is placed (no mirroring).
   - Otherwise, two rooks are placed (one by Player 1 and one by the computer).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of empty positions on the board after `k` moves.
   
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no more moves possible, so the result is `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one way to place the last rook, so the result is `1`.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without them attacking each other.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`, which accounts for the placement of rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - All calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

#### Verification Against Example:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `k = 1`, move `(1, 2)`
  - `num = 2` (one rook at `(1, 2)` and one at `(2, 1)`).
  - `m = 2`.
  - Using the DP approach, the number of configurations is `3`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `k = 1`, move `(7, 6)`
  - `num = 2`.
  - `m = 6`.
  - The number of configurations is `331`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 1000`, `k = 4`, moves `((4, 4), (952, 343), (222, 333), (90, 91))`
  - `num = 6`.
  - `m = 994`.
  - The number of configurations is `671968183`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
