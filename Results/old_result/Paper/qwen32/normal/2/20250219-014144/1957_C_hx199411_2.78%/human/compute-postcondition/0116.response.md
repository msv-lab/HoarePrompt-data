The code snippet sets the value of `dp[1]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The length of the `dp` list and its other elements are still as initially defined.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` is `n - (2k - count_equal)`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1 and all other elements initialized to 0.**
