The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, and if `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2. However, the code snippet only updates the values of `c` and `r` and does not affect `num` or any other variable.

Therefore, after executing the code, `c` and `r` will hold the new values read from the input, while `num` remains unchanged based on its previous condition. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; if `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2; `i` is 3**
