The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`
- `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` or 0
- `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0
- `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1
- `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input
- `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1

We only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2**
