The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `n` and `k` retain their values as they are not modified by this code snippet. The variables `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` also retain their previous values as they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` retain their previous values.**
