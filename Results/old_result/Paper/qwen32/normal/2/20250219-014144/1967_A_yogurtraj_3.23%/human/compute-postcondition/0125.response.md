Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is set to 0.
- `y` is set to 0.
- `k` is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2` and `k` is not equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `r`:**
   - `r` is explicitly defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - Here, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`, and `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` needs to be evaluated.
   - Substitute `r` with its definition: `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

3. **Simplification:**
   - Distribute `n` inside the parentheses: `a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n + 1`.
   - Since `(k // n) * n` is the integer part of `k` divided by `n` and then multiplied back by `n`, it simplifies to the largest multiple of `n` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Therefore, `(k // n) * n` is essentially the part of `k` that is divisible by `n`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression becomes: `a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n + 1`.
   - This can be further simplified to: `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 - (k % n)`, where `k % n` is the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`.
   - Since `k` is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, the exact value of `k` after reduction is not provided, but we know it affects the final value of `r`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the exact numerical value of `k` after reduction is not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe the expression precisely based on the given information.

Output: **(a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n + 1) (where r = a[n - 1] + k // n, and k is reduced by the sum of (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for all i from 0 to n - 2)**
