The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `ii` retains its previous value. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
