To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the range function `range(0, n - 1)` must generate at least one value. This means that the upper bound of the range, `n - 1`, must be greater than the lower bound, `0`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `r` is `a[0]`
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1
- `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than `1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input**
