The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means the previous value of `r` is overwritten by the new value.

Given the initial state, `r` was either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`. After executing the code, `r` is now specifically `a[i + 1]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2**.
