Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `r` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and either `i + 1` is out of bounds for the list `a` or `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**
