The value of `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. The values of `rem`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition that `k` is not equal to 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `k` is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2` and `k` is not equal to 0.**
