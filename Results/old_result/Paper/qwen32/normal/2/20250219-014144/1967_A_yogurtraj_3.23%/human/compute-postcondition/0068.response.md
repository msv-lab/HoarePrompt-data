The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means that the value of `r` is now specifically the element at index `i + 1` in the sorted list `a`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, and `a` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes its value is `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
