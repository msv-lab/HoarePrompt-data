The code sorts the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` will be in non-decreasing order after the execution. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
