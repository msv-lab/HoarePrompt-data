Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, and `ii` retains its previous value. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` becomes 0, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is set to 0, and `y` is set to 0.**
