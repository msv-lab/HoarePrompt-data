Output State: **`final` is a list containing the single element `n`; `t` has been decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` is unchanged; `mini` is unchanged; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is less than 50.**

Explanation: The only change is that the list `final` now contains the single element `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
