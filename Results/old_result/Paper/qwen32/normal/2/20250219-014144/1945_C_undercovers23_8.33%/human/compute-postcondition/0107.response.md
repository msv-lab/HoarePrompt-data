Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `len(final) == 0` if `c1 < 50` otherwise `final` contains the single element `0`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl` plus 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `zero` remains unchanged; `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not `'0'`, otherwise `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not `'0'` and `s[i-1]` was not `'0'`; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `lst` contains the elements `i + 1` and `i + 1` if it initially contained only `i + 1` after the append. Otherwise, `lst` contains only `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The only variable that changes in the given code snippet is `zero_perc`, which is recalculated using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described in the initial state.
