The given code snippet initializes a variable `mini` with the value \(10^8\). This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `mini`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is \(10^8\)**.
