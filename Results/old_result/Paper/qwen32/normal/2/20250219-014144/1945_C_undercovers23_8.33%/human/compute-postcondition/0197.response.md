The code appends `elem` to the list `final`. Therefore, `final` now includes `elem` as an additional element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, plus the newly appended `elem`; `t` has been decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
