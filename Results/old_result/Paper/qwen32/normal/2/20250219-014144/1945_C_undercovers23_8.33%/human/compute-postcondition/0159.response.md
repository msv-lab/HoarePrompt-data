To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
```

This line calculates the percentage of zeros encountered so far in the string `s` up to the `i`-th character. Here, `zero` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the current character `s[i]` is '0' or not. The variable `zero_perc` is being calculated using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.

Let's update the output state accordingly:

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; if `final` was initially empty, it now contains either one element `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or the single element `n` if `c1` is less than 50; otherwise, `final` remains unchanged as a sorted list containing elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2. `s` is the user's input string. `pk` is `n // 2`. `sl` is a list of characters from `s`. `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`. `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. If the current character `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1. `lst` is an empty list. `mini` is 100000000. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**

In simpler terms, the new variable `zero_perc` has been added to the state, which represents the ceiling of the percentage of zeros encountered in the string `s` up to the `i`-th character. All other variables remain unchanged.
