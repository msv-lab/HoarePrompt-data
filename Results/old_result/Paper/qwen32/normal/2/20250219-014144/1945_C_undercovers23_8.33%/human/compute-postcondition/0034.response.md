The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)
- `n` is at least 2
- `s` is the string provided by the user
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50
- `mini` is \(10^8\)
- `i` is 1
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`
- `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`

Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string provided by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is \(10^8\), `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`**
