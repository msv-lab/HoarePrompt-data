Output State: **After all iterations, `final` contains the optimal split point for each test case, ensuring that both halves of the string `s` have at least 50% '1's and '0's respectively.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Iterations:** The loop runs `t` times, where each iteration processes a different test case defined by `n` and `a`.
- **Processing Each Test Case:**
  - For each test case, the code calculates the midpoint `pk` of the string.
  - It then iterates through the string to find potential split points (`lst`) where both halves have at least 50% '1's and '0's.
  - It computes the minimum distance (`mini`) from these potential split points to the midpoint `pk`.
  - It constructs the `final` list with the closest split points to `pk`.
  - If no valid split points are found, it checks the overall percentage of '1's in the string. If it's 50% or more, the split point is `0`; otherwise, it's `n`.
- **Final Output:** After processing all test cases, the `final` list for each test case contains the optimal split point, which is printed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is that for each test case, the optimal split point ensuring both halves have at least 50% of each character type is determined and printed.
