The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, which iterates over the elements in the list `lst`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on adjusting `ele`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)
- `n` is the length of the string `s`
- `s` is the input string
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`
- `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`
- `zero` is the count of '0's encountered up to the second last character
- `one` is the count of '1's encountered up to the second last character
- `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50 and contains at least one element
- `mini` is the minimum of \(10^8\) and `abs(pk - ele)`
- `ele` is `next_ele` (the last element processed in the loop)
- After execution, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`

To proceed to the next iteration, `ele` should be the next element in `lst` after `next_ele`. Let's denote the next element in `lst` as `next_next_ele`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the count of '0's encountered up to the second last character, `one` is the count of '1's encountered up to the second last character, `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50 and contains at least one element, `mini` is the minimum of \(10^8\) and `abs(pk - next_ele)`, `ele` is `next_next_ele`**
