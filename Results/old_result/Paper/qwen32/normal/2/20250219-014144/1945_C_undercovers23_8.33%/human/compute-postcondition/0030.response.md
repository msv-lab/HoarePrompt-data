Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

The code calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Here, `zero` is the count of '0's in the string `s` up to index `i`, and `i` is the current index being processed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)
- `n` is at least 2
- `s` is the string provided by the user
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50
- `mini` is \(10^8\)
- `i` is 1
- If `s[i]` is '0', `z` (count of '0's) is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `o` (count of '1's) is incremented by 1.

After executing the line `zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, the value of `zero_perc` is calculated based on the count of '0's (`zero`) and the current index `i`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `zero_perc` and retain all other variables with their unchanged values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is \(10^8\); `i` is 1; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1.**
