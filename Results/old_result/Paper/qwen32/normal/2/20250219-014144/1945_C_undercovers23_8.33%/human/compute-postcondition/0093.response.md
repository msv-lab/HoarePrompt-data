Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `len(final) == 0` if `c1 < 50` otherwise `final` contains the single element `0`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not `'0'`, otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is a list containing the single element `i + 1`; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is also greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `lst` now contains the single element `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, and their conditions are still valid as described in the initial state.
