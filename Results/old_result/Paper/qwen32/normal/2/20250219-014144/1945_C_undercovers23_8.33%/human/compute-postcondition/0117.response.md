The code updates the value of `mini` by comparing its current value with the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is the next element in `lst`, the new value of `mini` will be the smaller of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. The values of `pk` and `ele` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`, `pk` is unchanged, `ele` is the next element in `lst`**.
