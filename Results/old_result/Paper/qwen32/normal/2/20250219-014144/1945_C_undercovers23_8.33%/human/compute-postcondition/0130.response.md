To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the list `lst`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
   - `pk` is `n // 2` where `n` is the length of `lst`.
   - `ele` is the last element in `lst`.
   - `final` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst`.
   - For each `elem`, it checks if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
   - If the condition is true, `elem` is appended to the `final` list.

After all iterations, the `final` list will contain all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

### Final Output State

**Output State: **`final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and the element is equal to `mini`.**

In simpler terms, the `final` list will include all elements from `lst` that are closest to the middle value of the list (`pk`).
