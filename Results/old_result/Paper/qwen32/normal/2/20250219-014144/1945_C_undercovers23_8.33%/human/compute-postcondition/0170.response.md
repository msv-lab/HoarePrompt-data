Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `lst` now includes `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the list `lst` now includes the value `i + 1`. All other variables retain their previous states and calculations.
