The code appends `elem` to the list `final`. Given that `final` initially contains `elem` only if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, and `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, appending `elem` to `final` means that `final` now includes `elem` regardless of the initial condition.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem` (regardless of the initial condition); `lst` contains at least one element and all have been processed.**
