Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines the optimal split point in the string such that both halves contain at least 50% of each character ('0' and '1'). If no such split exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on the majority character.**
