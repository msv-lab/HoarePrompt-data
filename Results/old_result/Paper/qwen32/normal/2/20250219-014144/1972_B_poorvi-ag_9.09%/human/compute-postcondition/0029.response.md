Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 7, and `results` contains `'no'` if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, `results` contains `'yes'` if the count of `'U'` in `arr` is greater than the count of `'D'` in `arr`; otherwise, `results` contains `'no'`.**
