The code snippet `results.append('yes')` appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it exists and is a list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 7, `results` contains `'yes'`.**
