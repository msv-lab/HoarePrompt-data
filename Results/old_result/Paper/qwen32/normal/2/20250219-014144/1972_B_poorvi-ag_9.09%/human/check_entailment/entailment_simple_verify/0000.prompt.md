You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, followed by a string s of length n containing only the characters 'U' and 'D'.

        n = int(input())

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Game Setup**: Coins form a circle, each either "U" (up) or "D" (down).
- **Gameplay**: Players take turns removing a "U" coin and flipping its neighbors.
- **Winning Condition**: The player who forces the opponent to make a move when no "U" coins remain wins.
- **Objective**: Determine if Alice (first player) wins given the initial configuration.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)
```

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Even Number of Coins (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - According to the provided code, if `n` is even, Alice always loses.
   - This might be correct because with an even number of coins, the parity of moves could lead to Bob always having the last move if both play optimally.

2. **Odd Number of Coins (`n % 2 != 0`)**:
   - If `n` is odd, the code checks if the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins.
   - If true, Alice wins; otherwise, she loses.
   - This rule seems more questionable. The number of "U" coins being greater than "D" coins does not necessarily mean Alice will always win.

### Potential Issues:
- **Odd Number of Coins**: The condition `arr.count('U') > arr.count('D')` is not a reliable way to determine the winner. The optimal strategy involves more complex considerations about the positions and sequences of "U" and "D" coins, not just their counts.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider configurations like all "U" coins or all "D" coins, or specific patterns that might favor one player over the other.

### Testing the Code:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program behaves as expected:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   3
   UUU
   
   Expected Output:
   YES
   ```
   - The program outputs `YES`, which seems correct since Alice can always force Bob into a losing position with three "U" coins.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   3
   UDD
   
   Expected Output:
   NO
   ```
   - The program outputs `NO`, which seems correct since Alice cannot force a win with this configuration.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   4
   UUUU
   
   Expected Output:
   NO
   ```
   - The program outputs `NO`, which seems correct since the number of coins is even.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   5
   UDDUU
   
   Expected Output:
   YES
   ```
   - The program outputs `YES`, which seems correct since Alice can force a win with this configuration.

### Conclusion:
While the program passes these test cases, the logic for determining the winner when `n` is odd is overly simplistic and does not account for all possible configurations and strategies. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect for some edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly assumes that the number of "U" coins being greater than "D" coins guarantees Alice's win for odd `n`. This is not always true, as the game's outcome depends on the specific arrangement and sequence of moves, not just the counts of "U" and "D" coins.
