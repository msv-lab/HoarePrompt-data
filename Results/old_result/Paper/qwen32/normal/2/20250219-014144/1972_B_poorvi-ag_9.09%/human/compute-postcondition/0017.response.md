The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial contents of `results`, `'no'` will be added to the end of it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `results` contains its original elements plus `'no'`, `i` is 6**.
