Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 6. If `arr.count('U') > arr.count('D')`, `results` contains its initial value plus `'yes'`. Otherwise, `results` contains `'no'` if `n` is even or `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr` (otherwise `'no'`), followed by another `'no'`.**
