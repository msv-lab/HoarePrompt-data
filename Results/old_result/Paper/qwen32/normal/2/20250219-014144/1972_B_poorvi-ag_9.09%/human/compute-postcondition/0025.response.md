The code snippet `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the end of the list `results`. This means that the list `results` will now contain one more element, which is the string `'no'`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 7, `results` contains the string `'no'`.**
