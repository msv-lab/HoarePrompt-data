The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `results`. Since the loop body is omitted, we only need to consider how the loop progresses based on the current state.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the second element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least a third element in the `results` list for `i` to take as its next value.

Given that `results` is a list with at least two elements, we need to ensure that it has at least three elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`results` is a list with at least three elements, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**
