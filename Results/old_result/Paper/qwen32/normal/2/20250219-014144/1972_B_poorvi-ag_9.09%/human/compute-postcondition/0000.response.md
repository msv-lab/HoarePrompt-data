Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters 'U' and 'D'.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The conditions for `t`, `n`, and `s` remain as specified in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
