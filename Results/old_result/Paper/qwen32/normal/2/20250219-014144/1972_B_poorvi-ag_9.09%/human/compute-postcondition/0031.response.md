In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in the list one by one.

To ensure that the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The values of the elements (`'yes'` or `'no'`) do not affect whether the loop will execute; they only affect what happens inside the loop body (which is omitted in this case).

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `results` has at least one element. The specific values of the elements in the list do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`results` is a list of `t` elements where `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**. 

However, since the exact number of elements `t` is not specified as needing to be more than 1 for the loop to execute, the minimal requirement is that `t` must be at least 1.

So, the final state can be simplified to:

State: **`results` is a list with at least one element, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**.
