In this case, the for loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in the list one by one. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `results` and how `i` would change.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `results` is a list with at least one element, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

Since the loop iterates directly over the elements of `results`, the loop variable `i` is set to the next element in the list during each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to the last element of the `results` list. For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least one more element.

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Current State**: `results` has at least one element, and `i` is the last element of `results`.
2. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least one more element than it currently has.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` now has an additional element.

### Example Adjustment:
If `results` had two elements `['yes', 'no']` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `results` should have three elements, e.g., `['yes', 'no', 'yes']`.

### Final State:
State: **`results` is a list with at least two elements, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**.

This ensures that there is another element for `i` to take on, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
