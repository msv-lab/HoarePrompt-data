The code snippet `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains the same as it was before the assignment. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t1`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
