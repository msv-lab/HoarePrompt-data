Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer representing the second input value.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- If `t % 2 == 0`, then `t` is `b // 2` and `t1` is `(b // 2) * 15 - b * 4`; Otherwise, `t` is `b // 2 + 1` and `t1` is `(b // 2 + 1) * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is `a - t1`.

Code snippet:
```python
t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 2`; If `t % 2 == 0`, then `t` was `b // 2` and `t1` is `(b // 2) * 15 - b * 4`; Otherwise, `t` was `b // 2 + 1` and `t1` is `(b // 2 + 1) * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`; `t` is now `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**
