To determine the new state after executing the given Python code snippet, we'll follow the instructions step-by-step:

Initial State: 
- `a` is an integer
- `b` are the new values provided by the input
- `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99
- `n` is greater than 0
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`

Code Snippet:
```python
t = t + t2 // 15
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its current value.

Calculating the New Value of `t`:
- The new value of `t` is `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.

Other Variables:
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t1`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input, `t` is `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is `i_end + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
The value of `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to its current value. All other variables retain their original values.
