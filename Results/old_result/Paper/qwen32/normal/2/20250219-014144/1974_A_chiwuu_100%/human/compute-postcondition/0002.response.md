The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a` and `b`. Since the input values are not specified, we assume they will be provided as strings. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are two integers `x` and `y`. However, the code does not directly relate to `t`, `x`, or `y`; it only affects `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are strings obtained from the split input.**
