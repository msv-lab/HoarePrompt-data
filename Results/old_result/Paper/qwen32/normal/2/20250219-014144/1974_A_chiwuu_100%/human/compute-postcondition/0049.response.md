Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 2`; If `t % 2 == 0`, then `t` is `b // 2` and `t1` is `(b // 2) * 15 - b * 4`; Otherwise, `t` is `b // 2 + 1` and `t1` is `(b // 2 + 1) * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**

In simpler terms, the output state remains the same except that `t2` is now calculated as `a - t1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
