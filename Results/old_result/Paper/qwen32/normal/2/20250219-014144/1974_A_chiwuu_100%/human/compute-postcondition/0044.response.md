The code snippet `t = t // 2` updates the value of `t` by performing integer division of its current value by 2. Given that `t` was initially set to `b`, after executing this line, `t` will be equal to `b // 2`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `a` remains an integer.
- `b` remains an integer representing the second input value.
- `t` is now equal to `b // 2`.
- `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `t1` is recalculated as `(b // 2) * 15 - b * 4`.
- `i` remains `i_end + 2`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `t` is `b // 2`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is `(b // 2) * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
