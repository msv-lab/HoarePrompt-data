Postcondition: **`a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` and `t1` remain as initially calculated. Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is recalculated based on whether `b % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 != 0`, and `t1` remains unchanged. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t1` remains unchanged.**
