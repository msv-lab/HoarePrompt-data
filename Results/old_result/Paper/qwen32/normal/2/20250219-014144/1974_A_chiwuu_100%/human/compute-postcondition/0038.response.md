Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer (new values provided by the input).
- `t` is initially calculated as:
  - `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` (which doesn't make sense here since `t` is being defined, not checked).
  - `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0` (also doesn't make sense here for the same reason).
  - Given the context, it seems `t` should be initialized as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.

### Logic for Updating `t`:
- If `t1 >= a`, no further changes are made to `t`.
- If `t1 < a`, then:
  - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
  - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` remains `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `t`:**
   - `t` is initialized based on the value of `b`:
     - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t = (b // 2) + 1`.

2. **Calculation of `t1`:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Condition Check and Update of `t`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2`:
     - `t2 = a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

### Final Output:
The value of `t` after all these calculations and conditions are met will be printed.

Given the complexity and the need for specific values of `a` and `b` to determine the exact numerical value of `t`, we can describe the output in terms of the described logic:

Output: **t (where t is calculated based on the given conditions involving a and b)**
