To determine the output of the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the conditions and calculations described in the initial state:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions**:
   - `a` and `b` are integers.
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `i_end + 2`.

2. **Conditions for Recalculation of `t`**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` and `t1` remain as initially calculated.
   - If `t1 < a`, the following happens:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is recalculated based on whether `b % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 != 0`.
     - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

3. **Determining the Value of `t`**:
   - Since the exact initial values of `t`, `t1`, and `t2` are not provided, we can only describe the logic based on the conditions.
   - If `t1 >= a`, the value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial calculation.
   - If `t1 < a`, the value of `t` changes based on the value of `t2 % 15`:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is recalculated depending on whether `b` is even or odd.
     - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

Given these conditions, we can summarize the output as follows:

- If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains as initially calculated.
- If `t1 < a` and `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is recalculated based on the parity of `b`.
- If `t1 < a` and `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

Since the exact values of `t`, `t1`, and `t2` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `t`. However, we can describe the value of `t` based on the given conditions.

Output: **t (where t is recalculated based on the conditions involving t1, t2, a, and b)**
