The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i_end + 2`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t1`, `t2`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the given instructions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`, unless updated as specified; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `t1 >= a`, no further changes are made to `t`. If `t1 < a`, then if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t2` remains `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**
