Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element from `cx`, `tmp` is 2 if `i` is an integer such that `i` ≥ `bx` and `i` ≤ `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. If `tmp` was initially 1 (which it would be if `i` is an integer such that `i` ≥ `bx` and `i` ≤ `ax`), it becomes 2. If `tmp` was initially 0 (which it would be if `i` does not satisfy the condition `i` ≥ `bx` and `i` ≤ `ax`), it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
