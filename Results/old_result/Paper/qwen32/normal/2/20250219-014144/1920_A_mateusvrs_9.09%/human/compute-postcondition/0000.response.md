The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `x`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not yet initialized or modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. Each of the following `n` lines contains two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. All pairs (`a`, `x`) are distinct.**
