The code snippet provided only reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, or `r` in any way. The only change is that `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer; `cx` is a set containing all unique values of `x` where `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
