Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`; `ax` is 1000000007 unless `a` equals 2 and `x` is less than 1000000007, in which case `ax` is `x`. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x_input` and `bx`, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is a set containing the value `x_input` if `a_input` does not equal 1 and `a_input` does not equal 2. Additionally, if `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x_input` and 1000000007, and `cx` also includes `x` if `a_input` equals 2. `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` is `a_input`; `x` is `x_input`.**
