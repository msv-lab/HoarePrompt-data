Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of several constraints defined by pairs of integers `(a, x)`. It calculates and outputs a result for each test case based on the given constraints. Specifically, for each test case, it determines the number of integers within a certain range that are not explicitly listed as constraints of type 3, given the maximum constraint of type 1 and the minimum constraint of type 2.**
