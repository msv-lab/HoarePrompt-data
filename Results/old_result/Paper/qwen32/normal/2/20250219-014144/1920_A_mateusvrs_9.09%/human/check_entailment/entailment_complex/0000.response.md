### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n` is read as the number of constraints.
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the smallest possible upper bound for `k`.
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the largest possible lower bound for `k`.

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, `a` and `x` are read.
     - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`. This ensures that `bx` holds the largest lower bound for `k`.
     - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`. This ensures that `ax` holds the smallest upper bound for `k`.
     - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`. This keeps track of all values that `k` cannot be.

4. **Calculating Valid `k` Values**:
   - After processing all constraints, if `bx >= ax`, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so `0` is appended to `r`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive that are not in `cx`:
     - `tmp` is initialized to `0` to count the number of invalid `k` values (those in `cx`).
     - For each value in `cx`, if it lies between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, `tmp` is incremented.
     - Finally, the number of valid `k` values is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appended to `r`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, one per line.

### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  1 3
  2 10
  3 1
  3 5
  ```

- **Processing**:
  - `bx` becomes `3` (from `1 3`).
  - `ax` becomes `10` (from `2 10`).
  - `cx` becomes `{1, 5}` (from `3 1` and `3 5`).
  - Since `bx < ax`, the program calculates the number of valid `k` values:
    - `tmp` is `2` because both `1` and `5` are in the range `[3, 10]`.
    - The number of valid `k` values is `10 - 3 + 1 - 2 = 7`.

- **Output**:
  ```
  7
  ```

The program correctly computes the number of valid `k` values for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints appropriately and calculates the number of valid `k` values accurately.

**Correctness: True**
