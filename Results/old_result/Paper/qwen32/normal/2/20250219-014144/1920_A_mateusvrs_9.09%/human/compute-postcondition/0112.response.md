Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` is the first integer from the input and is not equal to 1; `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
