The given code snippet assigns a specific integer value to the variable `ax`. The value assigned is `1000000007`, which is explicitly stated as `int(1000000000.0 + 7)`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `cx` remains an empty set.
- `ax` is now assigned the value `1000000007`.
- `bx` remains the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered.
- `r` remains containing the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is the input integer; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop.**
