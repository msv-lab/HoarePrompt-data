You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #This is printed: (nothing is printed)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of several constraints defined by pairs of integers `(a, x)`. It calculates and outputs a result for each test case based on the given constraints. Specifically, for each test case, it determines the number of integers within a certain range that are not explicitly listed as constraints of type 3, given the maximum constraint of type 1 and the minimum constraint of type 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the condition `if bx >= ax:`. According to the problem statement, `bx` should represent the maximum value from constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), and `ax` should represent the minimum value from constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x). If `bx` (minimum allowed value) is greater than `ax` (maximum allowed value), then there are no valid values for `k`, and the result should be `0`. However, the current implementation incorrectly appends `0` when `bx >= ax`.

The issue arises because the loop `for i in cx:` that counts how many excluded values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` is executed only when `bx < ax`. If `bx >= ax`, the loop is skipped, and `tmp` remains `0`. Therefore, the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` will not be evaluated, and the result will be `0` due to the initial `if bx >= ax:` check, which is correct. However, the logic inside the `else` block is flawed because it assumes that `bx < ax` and calculates the number of valid `k` values accordingly.

To fix this, the condition `if bx >= ax:` should be corrected to `if bx > ax:` to ensure that the program correctly identifies cases where no valid `k` values exist. When `bx == ax`, there is exactly one valid `k` value, which should be checked separately.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        elif bx == ax:
            r.append(1 if bx not in cx else 0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

This corrected version properly handles the case where `bx == ax` and ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
