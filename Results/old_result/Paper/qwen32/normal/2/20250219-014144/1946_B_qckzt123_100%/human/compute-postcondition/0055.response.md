The code sets `tmp` to 0, which changes its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 2; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input that has at least one element; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`; `x` is the next element in `a`; `tmp` is 0.**
