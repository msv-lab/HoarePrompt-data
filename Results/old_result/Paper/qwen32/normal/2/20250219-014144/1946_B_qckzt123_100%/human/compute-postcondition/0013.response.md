To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `x`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `max(0, tmp)`
- `tmp` is `0 + x`
- `T` is greater than 0
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element
- `s` is the sum of the list `a`

We need to figure out the state at the start of the next iteration. Since `x` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, it will take on the next value in the list `a`.

Let's assume that the previous value of `x` was the `i`-th element of the list `a`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the `(i+1)`-th element of the list `a`.

Since `t`, `tmp`, `T`, `n`, `k`, and `s` do not directly depend on the loop variable `x` (they are either constants or calculated based on the entire list `a`), they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains `max(0, tmp)` where `tmp` was `0 + x` in the previous iteration
- `tmp` will be recalculated as `0 + x` where `x` is now the next element in the list `a`
- `T` remains greater than 0
- `n` and `k` remain the same integers read from the input
- `a` remains the same list of integers read from the input
- `s` remains the sum of the list `a`

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we only need to update `x`.

State: **`t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is `0 + x`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
