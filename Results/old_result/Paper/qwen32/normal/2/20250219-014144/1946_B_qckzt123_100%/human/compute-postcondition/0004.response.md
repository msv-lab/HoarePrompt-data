The code reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This means that `a` will now hold a list of integers.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, except for the new list `a` that is created.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
