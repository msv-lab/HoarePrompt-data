The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `x`, or `tmp + x`. Only `tmp` is updated.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input that has at least one element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`, `x` is the next element in `a`, `tmp` is 0.**
