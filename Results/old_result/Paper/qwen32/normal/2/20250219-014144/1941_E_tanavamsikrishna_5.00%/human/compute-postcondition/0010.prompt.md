Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are the integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing one element, which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]` and the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing three elements, the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]`, the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, and the third being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
