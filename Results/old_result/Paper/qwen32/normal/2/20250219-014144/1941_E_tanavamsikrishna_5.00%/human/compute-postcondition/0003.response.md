The given code snippet only initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. It does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, or `costs`. Therefore, the only change is that `total_costs` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are the integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**
