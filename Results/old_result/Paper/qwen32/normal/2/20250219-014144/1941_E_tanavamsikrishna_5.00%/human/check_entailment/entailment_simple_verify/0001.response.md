Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_1`

The purpose of `func_1` is to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row under the given constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For the first `d-1` positions, it simply adds 1 to the depth value because supports must be installed there.
   - This is done with the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(0, d - 1):
         row[i] = row[i] + 1
     ```

2. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Positions**:
   - For positions from `d-1` to the end of the row, it calculates the cost by adding 1 to the depth and also considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` positions.
   - This is done with the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
         row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
     ```
   - The `min` function ensures that the cost is minimized by considering the lowest cost among the previous `d` positions.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the cost of the last position in the row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.
   - ```python
     return row[-1]
     ```

#### Function `func_2`

The purpose of `func_2` is to compute the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - It then reads the grid of depths.

2. **Calculating Costs for Each Row**:
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - ```python
     costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
     ```

3. **Finding Minimum Total Cost for `k` Consecutive Rows**:
   - It iterates through all possible starting points for `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each combination.
   - ```python
     for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
         total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
     ```
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations.
   - ```python
     print(min(total_costs))
     ```

### Evaluation of Annotations

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code seem to accurately describe the state of the program at key points. They correctly identify what happens in each loop and how the costs are computed.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Support Installation Constraints**:
  - The program correctly ensures that supports are installed at the first and last columns of each row.
  - It also ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

- **Cost Calculation**:
  - The cost calculation logic in `func_1` is correct. It properly adds 1 to the depth and considers the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` positions.

- **Minimum Total Cost**:
  - The program correctly iterates through all possible starting points for `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each combination.
  - It outputs the minimum total cost among all possible combinations.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and requirements as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
