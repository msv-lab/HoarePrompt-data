To determine the output of the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand how each component contributes to the final result.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`:**
   - These are integers read from the input. Their specific values are not provided, but they define the dimensions and parameters of the problem.

2. **`rows`:**
   - This is a 2D list of integers. Each sublist in `rows` represents a row in a grid.
   - The first and last elements of each sublist are 0.

3. **`costs`:**
   - This is a list of integers. Each element in `costs` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`.

4. **`total_costs`:**
   - This is a list containing the sums of every possible subarray of length `k` from `costs`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Generating `costs`:**
   - For each row in `rows`, the function `func_1(row, d)` is applied to compute a cost value.
   - The resulting values are stored in the `costs` list.

2. **Generating `total_costs`:**
   - We need to consider every possible subarray of length `k` within the `costs` list.
   - For each subarray, we calculate the sum of its elements.
   - All these sums are stored in the `total_costs` list.

3. **Finding the Minimum Value in `total_costs`:**
   - The `min(total_costs)` function call finds the smallest value among all the sums computed for the subarrays of length `k`.

### Final Output:

Given the above steps, the `print(min(total_costs))` statement will output the minimum sum of any subarray of length `k` from the `costs` list.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and the contents of `rows` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of any subarray of length `k` from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is the list of sums of every possible subarray of length k from costs)**
