### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, where each bridge requires supports to be placed such that:
1. Supports must be placed at the start `(i,1)` and end `(i,m)` of each row.
2. The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
3. The cost of placing a support at `(i,j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

The objective is to minimize the total cost of placing supports for all `k` bridges.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**: This function calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

##### `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` is intended to compute the minimal cost of placing supports in a single row under the given constraints. However, the implementation seems flawed:
- The first loop adds `1` to the first `d-1` elements of the row. This part seems reasonable as it places supports at the beginning and ensures that the first `d-1` positions are covered.
- The second loop attempts to calculate the minimal cost for the remaining positions in the row. It uses the minimum value from the previous `d+1` elements to determine the cost. However, this approach does not guarantee that the supports are placed optimally with respect to the distance constraint `d`.

The key issue here is that the current implementation does not ensure that the supports are placed in such a way that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it simply adds `1` to the first `d-1` elements and then uses a sliding window approach to calculate the cost, which does not account for the optimal placement of supports.

##### `func_2` Analysis:
This function reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then computes the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows. Finally, it outputs the minimum of these total costs. While the logic for computing the total cost for `k` consecutive rows is correct, the underlying cost calculation in `func_1` is flawed.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not correctly calculating the minimum cost of placing supports for a single row according to the constraints provided. The code does not properly handle the distance constraint `d`, and a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming, is required to ensure optimal placement of supports.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
