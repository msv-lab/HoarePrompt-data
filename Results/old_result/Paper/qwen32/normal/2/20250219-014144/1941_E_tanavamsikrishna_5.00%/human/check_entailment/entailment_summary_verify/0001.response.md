Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summaries to ensure everything aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Recap

The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. Each row requires supports at the first and last columns (depth 0) and possibly at other columns within a distance `d` constraint. The cost of installing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.

```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]
```

**Issues:**
1. **Initialization of First `d-1` Supports:**
   - The loop `for i in range(0, d - 1):` sets the cost of the first `d-1` supports to `row[i] + 1`. However, this doesn't consider the constraint that supports must be installed at the first and last columns. The first support should always be at `row[0]` with cost `row[0] + 1`, and the last support should always be at `row[m-1]` with cost `row[m-1] + 1`.
   
2. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Positions:**
   - The loop `for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):` calculates the cost for the remaining positions. The logic here seems flawed because it considers the minimum cost among the previous `d` positions (excluding the current one) and adds the current cell's depth plus one. This doesn't account for the fact that the first and last columns must have supports, and the distance between supports should not exceed `d`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads input values, computes the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.

```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
```

**Issues:**
1. **Cost Calculation Using `func_1`:**
   - As discussed, `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost of installing supports for a row due to the issues mentioned above.
   
2. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows is correct if `func_1` were to work properly. However, since `func_1` is flawed, the overall result will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in `func_1`, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the cost calculation for installing supports in a row does not adhere to the constraints and requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
