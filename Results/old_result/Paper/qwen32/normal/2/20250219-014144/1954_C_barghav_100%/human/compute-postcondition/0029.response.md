The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `f`. None of the other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`) are modified by this code. Therefore, the state of those variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; the value of `a[i]` is now the original value of `b[i]`; the value of `b[i]` is now the original value of `a[i]`; `f` is 1.**
