The code snippet swaps the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, the values at index `i` in both lists `a` and `b` will be swapped.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; the value of `a[i]` is now the original value of `b[i]`; the value of `b[i]` is now the original value of `a[i]`.**
