Given the initial state:

- `t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are variables with some values (though their specific values are not provided).
- `b` must have at least 4 elements.
- `i` is set to 4.
- `f` is set to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

Let's break down the statement:

- `b[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 4, `b[i]` means the element at index 4 of the list `b`.

However, it's important to note that Python uses zero-based indexing. Therefore, index 4 corresponds to the fifth element in the list `b`.

Since the exact elements of `b` are not provided, we can only say that the print statement will output the fifth element of the list `b`.

Output: **the fifth element of the list `b`**
