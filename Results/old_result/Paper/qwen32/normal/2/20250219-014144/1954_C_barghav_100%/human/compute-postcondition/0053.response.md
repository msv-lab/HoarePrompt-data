Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, with digits ranging from 1 to 9. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating the result of some comparison or operation between `x` and `y`.**
