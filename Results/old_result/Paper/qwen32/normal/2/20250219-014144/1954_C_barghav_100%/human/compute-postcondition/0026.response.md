Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If `f` was initially 0 and `a[i] < b[i]`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped, `f` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `f` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1. If `f` was initially 1, and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, the `i`-th elements of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.**
