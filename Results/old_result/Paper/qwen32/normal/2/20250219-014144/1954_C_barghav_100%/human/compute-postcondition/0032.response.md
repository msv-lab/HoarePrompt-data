Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` was originally less than `b[i]`, then the value of `a[i]` is now the original value of `b[i]`, the value of `b[i]` is now the original value of `a[i]`, and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1; if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `f` remains unchanged.**
