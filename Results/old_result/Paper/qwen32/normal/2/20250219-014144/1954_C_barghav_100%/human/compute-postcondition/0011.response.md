Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length, `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, and the digit at index `i` in `a` is greater than or equal to the character at index `i` in `b`. If the digit at index `i` in `a` is greater than the character at index `i` in `b`, then `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0.**
