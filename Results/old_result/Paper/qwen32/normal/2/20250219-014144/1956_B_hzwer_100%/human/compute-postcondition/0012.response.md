The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified in this snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each value at index `x` represents the count of how many times `x` appears in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**
