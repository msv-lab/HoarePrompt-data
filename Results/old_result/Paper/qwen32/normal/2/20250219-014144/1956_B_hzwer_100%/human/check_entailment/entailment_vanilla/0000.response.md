Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. Players take turns placing cards on the table, and a player earns a point if they place a card that matches a card already on the table. The goal is to maximize your score, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Key Observations

1. **Card Distribution**: Since each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck, each player will receive either zero, one, or two cards of each integer.
2. **Scoring**: A player scores a point only when they place a card that has already been placed on the table. This means that for any integer `x`, if you have two cards of `x`, you can score at most one point by placing the second card after the first one is already on the table.
3. **Optimal Play**: Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the problem asks for the maximum score you can achieve regardless of Nene's strategy. Given that Nene is playing optimally, you can only score points from pairs of cards you hold.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand and calculates the maximum possible score you can achieve by considering the pairs of cards you have:

- `cnt = [0] * (n + 1)`: Initializes a count array to keep track of how many times each integer appears in your hand.
- `for x in a: cnt[x] += 1`: Populates the count array with the frequency of each integer in your hand.
- `ans = 0`: Initializes the answer variable to store your maximum score.
- `for x in cnt: ans += max(0, x - 1)`: For each integer `x`, if you have more than one card (`x > 1`), you can score `x - 1` points. Since you can only score a point for each pair, this effectively counts the number of pairs you have.

### Conclusion

The solution correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the pairs of cards you hold. Since Nene plays optimally, she will not interfere with your ability to score points from your own pairs, and thus the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
