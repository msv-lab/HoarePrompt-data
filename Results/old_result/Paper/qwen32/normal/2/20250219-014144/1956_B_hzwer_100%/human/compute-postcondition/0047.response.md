The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `x` changes.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the same integer value as `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer.
- `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers with one element incremented by 1.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, adjusted for the incremented element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has taken on the value of the current element in `a` and the loop will proceed to the next element in `a` if there are any remaining elements.

To execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element to iterate over. The state of `x` will be the next element in `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the same integer value as `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two integers, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers with one element incremented by 1, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, adjusted for the incremented element, `x` is the next element in `a`**.
