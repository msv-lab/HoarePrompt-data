The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `x` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element, and `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` has already been incremented by 1.

After executing the code, the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` will be incremented again by 1. Therefore, the value at index `x` in `cnt` will be 2 more than its original value before any increments.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` has been incremented by 2, `x` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element.**
