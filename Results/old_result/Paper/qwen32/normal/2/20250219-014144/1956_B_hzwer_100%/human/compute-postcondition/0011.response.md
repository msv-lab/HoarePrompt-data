Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each value at index `x` represents the count of how many times `x` appears in the list `a`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed for all elements in the list `a`, the variable `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer from 0 to `t` as it appears in the list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` retains its original list of integers.
