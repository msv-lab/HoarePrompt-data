The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to `num2`. This means `num2` will now hold the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is either 0 or the number of times the loop ran. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `op` is the number of times the loop ran, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is `median_initial`, and `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
