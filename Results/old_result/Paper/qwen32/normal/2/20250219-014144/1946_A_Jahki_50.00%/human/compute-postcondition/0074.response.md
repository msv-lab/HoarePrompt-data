The `print(16668)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `16668`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides details about various variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `i`, `op`, `b`, `median`, `new_median`, `ma`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(16668)` statement directly outputs the integer `16668`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **16668**
