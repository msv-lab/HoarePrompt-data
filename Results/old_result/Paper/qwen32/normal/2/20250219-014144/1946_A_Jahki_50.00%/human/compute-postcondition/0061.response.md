To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `new_median <= median`. The variables involved in this condition are `new_median` and `median`.

Given:
- `median` is `b[ma] - 2` (before the latest increment).
- `new_median` is `b[ma]` (after the latest increment).

For the loop to execute again, the condition `new_median <= median` must be true. This means that `b[ma]` (which is `new_median`) should be less than or equal to `b[ma] - 2` (which is `median`). However, this condition is logically impossible because `b[ma]` cannot be less than or equal to `b[ma] - 2`.

Therefore, to satisfy the condition `new_median <= median` for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the values such that the condition holds true. This implies that `new_median` should be set to a value that is indeed less than or equal to `median`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- We need to ensure that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.
- Since `new_median` is `b[ma]` and `median` is `b[ma] - 2`, we need to decrement `b[ma]` by 2 before the latest increment to make `new_median` equal to `median`.

Thus, we need to adjust `b[ma]` such that `b[ma]` (which is `new_median`) becomes `b[ma] - 2` (which is `median`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` decremented by 2 and correctly positioned, `median` is `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**
