The given code snippet modifies the list `a` by splitting the input string `case` into individual elements, converting them to integers, and filtering out any non-digit elements. This means that the new list `a` will contain only the integers found in the string `case`.

Given the initial state, `a` was originally a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, `a` is reassigned to a new list derived from the string `case`. The values of `t`, `n`, `num`, `num2`, and `op` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0**.
