The code snippet calculates `ma` by performing integer division of `num2` by 2. Given that `num2` is an odd integer less than or equal to 10000, `ma` will be the largest integer less than or equal to half of `num2`.

For example, if `num2` is 9999, then `ma` would be 4999.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, `num2` is odd, `ma` is the integer part of `num2 / 2`.**
