To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition: `new_median` and `median`.

Given the loop condition:
```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. However, since we want the loop to continue executing, we should adjust the state such that `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median`.

From the provided state:
- `median` is `b[ma]` (before increment)
- `new_median` is `b[ma]` (after increment)

Since `new_median` is `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `new_median` is always greater than `median`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `new_median` to be less than or equal to `median`. This can be achieved by ensuring that `b[ma]` (which is `median`) is incremented in such a way that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median`, which is logically impossible given the current setup where `new_median` is defined as `b[ma] + 1`.

However, if we interpret the task as ensuring the loop can proceed based on the given structure without changing the definition of `new_median`, we should consider adjusting `median` to be greater than `new_median`. But since `new_median` is `median + 1`, we need to adjust `median` downwards.

Let's adjust `median` to be `new_median - 1` to ensure the loop condition holds true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `median` is `b[ma] - 1` (before increment), `new_median` is `b[ma]` (after increment), `i` is `i + 1`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**
