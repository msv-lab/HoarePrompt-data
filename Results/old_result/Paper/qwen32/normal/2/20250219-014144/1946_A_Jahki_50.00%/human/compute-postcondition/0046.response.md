Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is `median_initial`, `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
