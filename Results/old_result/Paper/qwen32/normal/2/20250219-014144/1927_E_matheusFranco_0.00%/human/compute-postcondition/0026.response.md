To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that the loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 2`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`.
- `i` is 1.

We need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still less than `len(permutation)` (which is `n`). Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially set to `k + 1`, we need to check if `k + 1 < n`.

If `k + 1 < n`, then the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments. However, if `k + 1` is not less than `n`, we need to adjust `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to be less than `n`.

Since the problem specifies that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, the smallest possible value for `k` is 2. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `k + 1` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

Given that `k + 1` is already calculated and `n` is defined to be greater than or equal to `k`, the condition `k + 1 < n` should generally hold true unless `n` is exactly `k + 1`, which is not possible given the constraints `2 <= k <= n` and `k` being even.

Thus, no adjustment is necessary based on the given conditions.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`; `i` is 1**
