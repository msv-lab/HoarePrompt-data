To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `permutation` list based on the given conditions. The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it fills certain positions in the `permutation` list with increasing values starting from `curr_v`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop fills the `permutation` list:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - `curr_v` starts at 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the loop fills positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` in the `permutation` list with values starting from `curr_v` and incrementing `curr_v` after each assignment.

3. **Detailed Filling Process**:
   - In the first iteration (`i=0`), positions `0, k, 2k, ...` are filled with values `1, 2, 3, ...` up to `floor(n/k)`.
   - In the second iteration (`i=1`), positions `1, k+1, 2k+1, ...` are filled with values starting from `floor(n/k) + 1` up to `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)`.
   - In the third iteration (`i=2`), positions `2, k+2, 2k+2, ...` are filled with values starting from `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1` up to `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + ceil((n-2)/k)`.
   - This pattern continues until the `k`-th iteration.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all `k` iterations, the `permutation` list will be completely filled with values from 1 to `n` in a specific pattern determined by the multiples of `k` plus the current iteration index `i`.

The final `curr_v` value will be `n + 1` because the loop assigns values from 1 to `n` to the `permutation` list.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1 through `n` distributed according to the pattern described above; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last position updated in the final iteration; `i` is `k-1`.**

In simpler terms, the `permutation` list will contain numbers from 1 to `n` arranged in a specific pattern based on multiples of `k` and the iteration index, and `curr_v` will be `n + 1` after all iterations are complete.
