The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`. Given that `k` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` which was initially 4, becomes 6. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even (e.g., `k` is 2); `permutation` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1, the second element set to 0, the third element set to 2, and the fourth element set to 3; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 6; `n` must be greater than 4.**
