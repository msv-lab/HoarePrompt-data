You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n, k is even, and n is the length of the desired permutation.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1

            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1 through `n` distributed according to the pattern described above; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last position updated in the final iteration; `i` is `k-1`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a space-separated string of the elements in the permutation list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints a permutation of length `n` where elements are filled in a specific pattern determined by the value of `k`. The pattern involves filling every `k`-th position starting from each index from 0 to `k-1`, incrementing the value to be placed each time.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables or relationships to describe.

        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` repeatedly calls `func_1` a number of times specified by the integer input `t`. After `t` calls, the function terminates without returning any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n. A k-level permutation is defined such that for all continuous segments of length k, the sums of these segments differ by no more than 1.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Generates a single k-level permutation for given n and k.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

#### `func_1()`:
- It initializes a permutation list of size `n` with zeros.
- It iterates over the range of `k` and fills the permutation list in a pattern where elements are placed at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i`.
- It increments the value being placed in the permutation list after each placement.

#### `func_2()`:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
The key part of the program is how it fills the permutation list. The approach used here might not guarantee that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1. Let's consider a few test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: `2 1` or `1 2` (both valid)
- Program Output: `1 2` (valid)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: `1 3 2` or `2 1 3` or `3 2 1` (all valid)
- Program Output: `1 3 2` (valid)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
- Expected Output: Any permutation where the sums of all continuous segments of length 4 differ by no more than 1.
- Program Output: `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`
  - Sums of segments of length 4: `[23, 29, 23, 24, 23, 23]`
  - Max sum: 29, Min sum: 23
  - Difference: 6 (not valid)

The above example shows that the program does not generate a valid k-level permutation for all cases. Specifically, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` exceeds 1.

### Conclusion:
Since we found a test case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to ensure that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` in the generated permutation differ by no more than 1. This is evident from the test case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`. The sums of the segments do not meet the required condition, indicating that the logic used in `func_1()` is flawed.
