The given code snippet increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially set to `2 + k`. After executing the code, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `2 + k + k`, which simplifies to `2 + 2*k`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere except `permutation[2]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1` and `permutation[2 + k]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 4.**
