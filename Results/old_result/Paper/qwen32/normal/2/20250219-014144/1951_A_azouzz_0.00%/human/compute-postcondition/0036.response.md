Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1.
- `n` is the new integer input by the user.
- `s` is the new string input by the user.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) are used in this particular `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
