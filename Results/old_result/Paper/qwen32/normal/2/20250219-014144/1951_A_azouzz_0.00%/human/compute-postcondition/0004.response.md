The code snippet `cnt1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This affects the variable `cnt1` which is now assigned the count of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
