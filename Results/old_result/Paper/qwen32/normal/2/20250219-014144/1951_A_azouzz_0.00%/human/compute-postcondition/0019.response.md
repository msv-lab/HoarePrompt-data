The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the string input by the user; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
