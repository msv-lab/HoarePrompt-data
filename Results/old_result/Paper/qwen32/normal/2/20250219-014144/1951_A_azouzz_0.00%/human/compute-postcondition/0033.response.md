Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1 (though this change does not affect the print statement directly).
- `n` is the new integer input by the user.
- `s` is the new string input by the user.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1` are used in this print statement. Therefore, their specific values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
