The code snippet updates the value of `cnt1` to the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.**
