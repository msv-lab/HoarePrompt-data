You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: `l > r`, `k` is reduced to a non-positive value or a value less than the smallest possible operation cost, `sunks` reflects the total number of successful operations, and `a` has some elements potentially modified or set to 0.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of successful operations, which is represented by the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `a`), `k` (a threshold value), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It performs operations to reduce `k` by subtracting twice the smaller element between the first and last elements of the list `a`, adjusting the list accordingly, and counts the number of successful operations. The function returns the total count of these successful operations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the provided program, there are several issues that suggest it may not handle all cases correctly:

1. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The `while l <= r` loop can potentially run indefinitely if the conditions inside do not properly decrement `k` or adjust `l` and `r` pointers. For instance, if `a[l]` or `a[r]` is very large compared to `k`, the loop might not terminate as expected.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Single Ship Case**: When `l == r`, the code checks if `k >= a[r]`. If true, it increments `sunks` and breaks. However, if `k < a[r]`, it simply breaks without considering whether `k` could still sink the ship partially. This could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The code does not handle scenarios where `k` is extremely large relative to the total durability of all ships. In such cases, the Kraken would sink all ships, but the current implementation might not account for this efficiently.

4. **Inefficient Use of Resources**: The code modifies the list `a` directly, which might not be necessary and could lead to unexpected behavior if the list is reused or needs to be preserved.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
5 100
1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
The code might not correctly handle this scenario because it does not ensure that all ships are sunk when `k` is sufficiently large.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach would involve calculating the total durability of all ships and using binary search to determine how many ships can be sunk within `k` attacks. This would ensure that the solution is both efficient and correct for all edge cases.
