Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2` is not equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `r`, `l`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only impact is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
