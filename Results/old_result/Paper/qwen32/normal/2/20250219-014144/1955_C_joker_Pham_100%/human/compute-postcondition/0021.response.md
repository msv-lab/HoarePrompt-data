Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is either 0 or an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is less than `r`, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[r]` became 0. Additionally, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`. `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) retain their previous values.
