Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If `l` was equal to `r`, then `r` is decremented by 1 to ensure `l <= r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` was not equal to `r`, no adjustments are made to `l` or `r`.**
