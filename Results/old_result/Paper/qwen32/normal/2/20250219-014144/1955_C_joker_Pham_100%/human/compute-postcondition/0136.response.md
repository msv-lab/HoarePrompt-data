Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `a`), `k` (a threshold value), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It performs operations to reduce `k` by subtracting twice the smaller element between the first and last elements of the list `a`, adjusting the list accordingly, and counts the number of successful operations. The function returns the total count of these successful operations.**
