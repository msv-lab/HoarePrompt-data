Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is either 0 or an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is less than `r`, `r` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. The current value of `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`. `sunks` remains 0 unless the condition `l == r` and `k >= a[r]` was met before entering this if statement.**
