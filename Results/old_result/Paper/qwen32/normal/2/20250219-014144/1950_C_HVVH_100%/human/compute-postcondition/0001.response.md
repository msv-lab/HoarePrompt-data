Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is a string representing the hour from "00" to "23" and mm is a string representing the minute from "00" to "59"; day is 'AM'; n is an input integer.**

This means that the value of `n` is now set to whatever integer value was provided by the input, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, and `day`) remain unchanged.
