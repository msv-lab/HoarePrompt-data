Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". If `h` (the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer) is greater than 12, then `h` is reduced by 12, `day` is set to 'PM', and `h` is now between 1 and 12 (inclusive). If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than 0, `h` is not equal to 0, and `h` is less than or equal to 12. `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer.**
