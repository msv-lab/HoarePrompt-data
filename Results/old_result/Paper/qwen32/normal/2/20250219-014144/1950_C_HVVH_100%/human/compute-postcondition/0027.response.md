Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains unchanged. `n` is unchanged throughout.**
