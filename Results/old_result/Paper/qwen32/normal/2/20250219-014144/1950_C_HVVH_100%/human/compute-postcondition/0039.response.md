Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` and `m` are the integer values extracted from the input string "hh:mm". If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'. `n` is unchanged.**
