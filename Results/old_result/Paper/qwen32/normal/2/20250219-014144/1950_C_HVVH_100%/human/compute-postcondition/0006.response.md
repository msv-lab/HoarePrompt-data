The given code snippet only contains the line `day = 'AM'`. This line sets the value of the variable `day` to the string `'AM'`. None of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, `m`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer.**
