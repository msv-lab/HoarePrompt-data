Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". If `h` (the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer) is 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'. `n` is greater than 0, `h` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), and `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer.**
