You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of time strings to process. For each of the `n` time strings in the format "hh:mm" (where "hh" is the hour from "00" to "23" and "mm" is the minute from "00" to "59"), it converts the time to a 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM designation and prints the result. The original input values remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is fine because we need to start with AM as the default period.

2. **Reading Input**: The number of test cases `n` is read from the input. Then, a loop runs `n` times to process each test case.

3. **Splitting Time**: For each test case, the time string `s` is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

4. **Converting Hours**:
   - If `h` is `0`, it is set to `12` and `day` is set to `'AM'`. This correctly handles midnight.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it is converted to 12-hour format by subtracting `12` from `h`, and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `12`, `day` remains `'AM'` unless `h` is exactly `12`, in which case `day` is set to `'PM'`. This correctly handles noon.

5. **Printing Output**: The formatted time string is printed using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'` to ensure that both hours and minutes are displayed with two digits, followed by the appropriate period (`AM` or `PM`).

### Issues Found:
- The logic for setting the `day` variable when `h` is between `1` and `12` is correct, but the code unnecessarily sets `day` to `'AM'` before checking if `h` is `12`. This can be simplified by removing the redundant assignment.
- However, the core logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format appears to be correct.

### Simplified Code:
While the original code is functionally correct, it can be slightly optimized for clarity:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program correctly converts the given times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases such as midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
