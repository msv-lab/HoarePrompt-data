Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` and `m` are the integer values extracted from the input string "hh:mm", where `h` is now `h - 12`. `day` is 'PM'. `n` is unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `day` has been changed to 'PM', while all other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
