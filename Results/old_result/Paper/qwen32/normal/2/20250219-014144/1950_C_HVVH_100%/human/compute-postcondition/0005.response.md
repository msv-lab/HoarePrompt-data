The value of `h` is set to 12. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer.**
