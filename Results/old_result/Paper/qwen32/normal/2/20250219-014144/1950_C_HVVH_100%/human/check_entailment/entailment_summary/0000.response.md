### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n`, which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each of these `n` test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format "hh:mm".
   - It splits this string into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

3. **Converting to 12-hour Format:**
   - If `h` (hour) is `0`, it sets `h` to `12` and designates the time as "AM".
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and designates the time as "PM".
   - If `h` is between `1` and `12` inclusive, it designates the time as "AM". However, there's a special case where if `h` is `12`, it designates the time as "PM".

4. **Formatting and Printing Output:**
   - The program formats the hour and minute to ensure they have two digits using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.
   - It then prints the formatted time along with the AM/PM designation.

### Analysis:

- **Handling Midnight (`00:xx`):** The program correctly converts `00:xx` to `12:xx AM`.
- **Handling Noon (`12:xx`):** The program correctly converts `12:xx` to `12:xx PM`.
- **Handling PM Hours (`13:xx` to `23:xx`):** The program correctly converts these to the corresponding PM times by subtracting `12` from the hour.
- **Handling AM Hours (`01:xx` to `11:xx`):** The program correctly keeps these as AM times.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
