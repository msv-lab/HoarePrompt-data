The code snippet sets the variable `day` to the string `'AM'`. The values of `t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` is 12. `m` is the integer value extracted from the input string "hh:mm". `day` is 'AM'. `n` is unchanged.**
