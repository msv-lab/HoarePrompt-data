Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer and `h` equals 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer, and `h` is less than or equal to 12.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `day` is now 'PM'. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
