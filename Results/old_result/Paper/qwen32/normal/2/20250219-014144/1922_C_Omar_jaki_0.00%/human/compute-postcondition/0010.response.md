To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables involved in the `zip` function within the `for` loop. The `zip` function creates tuples from the elements of the four slices of the list `a`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In each iteration, the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` take values from `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, `a[i+2]`, and `a[i+3]` respectively, where `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were taken from `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, `a[i+2]`, and `a[i+3]`. For the next iteration, these indices should be incremented by 1.

Let's denote the current index `i` as `current_index`. After the previous iteration, `current_index` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `current_index` should be incremented again.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the current index**: Let's assume the current index after the previous iteration was `current_index`.
2. **Increment the index**: For the next iteration, `current_index` should be `current_index + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `current_index` from the previous state, we can denote the new state as follows:

- `w` will now take the value from `a[current_index + 1]`
- `x` will now take the value from `a[current_index + 2]`
- `y` will now take the value from `a[current_index + 3]`
- `z` will now take the value from `a[current_index + 4]`

However, since we don't have the exact value of `current_index`, we can represent the state in terms of the next expected values based on the loop progression.

### Final State:
Given the structure of the list `a` and the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration can be described as:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `b` is `[0, 0, v`**

Since the specific values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` depend on the current index, we can generalize that the indices for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` have all been incremented by 1 compared to the previous iteration.

Thus, the state remains the same in terms of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `b`, but conceptually, the indices for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` have moved to the next set of values in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `b` is `[0, 0, v`**
