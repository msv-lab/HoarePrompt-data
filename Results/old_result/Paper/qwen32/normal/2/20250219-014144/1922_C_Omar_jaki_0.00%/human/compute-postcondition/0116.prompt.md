Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u` is `0`; the list remains `[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u` is 0; `t` is potentially a different value; the list `b` remains potentially modified; `a` is a tuple with at least \( n+2 \) elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by \( n \) elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u` is 0, `t` is `t - initial_u`, `b` is `[0, 0, v_or_1, v_or_1, v_or_1 + v, v_or_1 + v, ..., accumulated sums]`, `a` is a tuple with at least \( n+2 \) elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by \( n \) elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
