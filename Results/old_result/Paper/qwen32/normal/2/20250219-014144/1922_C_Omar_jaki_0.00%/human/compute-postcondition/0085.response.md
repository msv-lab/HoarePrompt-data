To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Let's break down what happens:
- `b` is initially `[0, 0]`.
- The expression `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` is evaluated and added to `b`.
- The expression `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` is evaluated and added to `b`.

Given that `b` is a list, the `+=` operator appends the results of these expressions to `b`. 

Let's denote the current elements of `b` as `b[0]` and `b[1]`, which are both `0` initially.

1. `b[-2]` refers to `b[0]`, which is `0`.
2. `b[-1]` refers to `b[1]`, which is `0`.

The expressions to be appended are:
- `0 + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `0 + v ** (v > z - y)`

The term `v ** (v > x - w)` means:
- If `v > x - w` is `True` (which is `1` in Python), then `v ** 1` which is `v`.
- If `v > x - w` is `False` (which is `0` in Python), then `v ** 0` which is `1`.

Similarly, the term `v ** (v > z - y)` means:
- If `v > z - y` is `True` (which is `1` in Python), then `v ** 1` which is `v`.
- If `v > z - y` is `False` (which is `0` in Python), then `v ** 0` which is `1`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y` are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether `v > x - w` or `v > z - y` is `True` or `False`. However, we can express the new elements of `b` in terms of these conditions.

Thus, the new elements of `b` will be:
- `0 + v ** (v > x - w)` which is either `v` or `1`
- `0 + v ** (v > z - y)` which is either `v` or `1`

Therefore, the updated `b` will be `[0, 0, v_or_1, v_or_1]` where `v_or_1` is `v` if the respective condition is `True` and `1` if the condition is `False`.

Output State: **`u` is 0, `t` is `t-1`, `b` is `[0, 0, v_or_1, v_or_1]`, `a` is a tuple with at least 4 elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least 2 elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `v` is `y - x`.** Here, `v_or_1` is `v` if `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are `True` respectively, otherwise `1`.
