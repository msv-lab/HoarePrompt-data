Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins ('U'). According to the problem statement, Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob wins if it is even. The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U's in the string `s` and returns 'YES' if this count is odd, and 'NO' otherwise. This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players, ensuring the program's correctness.
