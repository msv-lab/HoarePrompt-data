### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle, with players taking turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start of the game.

- If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will always win.
- If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob will always win.

This conclusion is derived from the fact that each move flips an even number of coins (two, unless there are fewer than two coins left), which preserves the parity of the number of 'U' coins. Since the game ends when there are no more 'U' coins, the player who starts with an odd number of 'U' coins will make the last move and thus win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' characters in the string and checking if this count is odd or even. If it's odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.
