The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, and `sums` remain unchanged except for `ans` which now includes the new element `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `i + 2`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` includes the new element `sums`.**
