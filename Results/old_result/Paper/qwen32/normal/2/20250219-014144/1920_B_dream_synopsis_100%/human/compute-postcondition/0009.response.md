The code calculates a new variable `sums` based on the existing variables `sum1` and `a`. Specifically, `sums` is computed as `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

Given that `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `a` is a list of integers, the new variable `sums` is derived from these values.

Since the values of `sum1` and `a` are not explicitly provided, we can express `sums` in terms of these variables. The first `x` elements of `a` are summed, and this sum is then multiplied by 2 and subtracted from `sum1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` must be at least 0, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, the current value of `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
