The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the order of the list `a`. Given that `a` was initially sorted in ascending order, after reversing, `a` will be sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of `n` integers read from the input and sorted in descending order; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the old `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is calculated based on the rules specified in the loop.**
