The given code snippet modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `sums` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer its context from the description. The variable `sums` is used in the conditions to determine the final value of `ans`.

Since `i` is `i + 2`, the value of `a[i - 1]` refers to the element at index `i - 1` in the list `a`. The list `a` is described as a reversed (descending) list of `n` integers.

After executing the line `sums = sums + a[i - 1]`, the new value of `sums` is the old value of `sums` plus the element at index `i - 1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sums` and the second being `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums + a[i - 1], sums]`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
