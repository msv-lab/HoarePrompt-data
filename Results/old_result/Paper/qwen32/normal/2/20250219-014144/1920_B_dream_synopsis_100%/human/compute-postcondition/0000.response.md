In the given task, the for loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is determined by the integer `t`. The loop head only involves the variable `_`, which is a common convention for a loop variable when its value is not used within the loop. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The current state already specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Since no other variables in the loop head need adjustment, and the provided state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
