The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i-1` from the list `a`. Since `a` is a reversed sorted list, the element at index `i-1` is the `i-th` largest element in the original list.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed, the value of `i` in this context refers to the current iteration index (starting from 1).

Therefore, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus the `i-th` largest element in the original list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.**
