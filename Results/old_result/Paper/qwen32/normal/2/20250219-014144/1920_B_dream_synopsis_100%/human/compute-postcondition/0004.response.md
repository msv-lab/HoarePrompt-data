The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `a`. Given that `a` was initially a sorted list of `n` integers, after reversing, `a` will now be in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input.**
