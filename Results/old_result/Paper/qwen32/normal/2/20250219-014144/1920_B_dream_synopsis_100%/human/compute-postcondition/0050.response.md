The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. After appending `sums` to `ans`, `ans` will no longer be an empty list but will contain one element, which is `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
