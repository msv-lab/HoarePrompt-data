The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. This means the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged unless they are modified later in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of sums computed as per the loop logic.**
This means that `n`, `k`, and `x` now hold the values specified by the input, while all other variables retain their initial states.
