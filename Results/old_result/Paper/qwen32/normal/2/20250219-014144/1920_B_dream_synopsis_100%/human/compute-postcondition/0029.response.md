The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates over `range(k + 1)`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. To prepare for the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1 again.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented to its current value.
- The loop condition is `for i in range(k + 1)`, meaning `i` should take values from `0` to `k` inclusive.
- To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sums` and the second being `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums + a[i - 1], sums]`.**
