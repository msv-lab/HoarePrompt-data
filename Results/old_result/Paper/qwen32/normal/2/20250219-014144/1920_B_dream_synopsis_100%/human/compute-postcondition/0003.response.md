The code sorts the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers read from the input.**
