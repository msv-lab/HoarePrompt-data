The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`
- `i` is either 0 or not 0. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, it will be 1 in the next iteration. If `i` was not 0, it will simply be incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1**
