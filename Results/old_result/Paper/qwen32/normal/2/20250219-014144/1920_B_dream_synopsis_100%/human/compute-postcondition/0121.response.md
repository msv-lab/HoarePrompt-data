Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions defined in the problem (related to `n`, `k`, `x`, and the elements of `a`) are met, it returns a particular value or performs a specific operation; otherwise, it may return a different value or handle the case accordingly.**
