To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables over each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n`, `k`, `x`: Integers read from the input.
- `a`: A reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1`: The sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans`: An empty list.

### Loop Execution Details:
The loop runs for `k + 1` iterations (`for i in range(k + 1)`).

#### Iteration Breakdown:
1. **Iteration 0 (`i = 0`)**:
   - `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - `ans` is updated to include `sums`.

2. **Iteration 1 (`i = 1`)**:
   - If `i + x - 1 < n` (i.e., `1 + x - 1 < n` or `x < n`), then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.
   - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`.
   - `ans` is updated to include the new `sums`.

3. **Iteration 2 (`i = 2`)**:
   - If `i + x - 1 < n` (i.e., `2 + x - 1 < n` or `x + 1 < n`), then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`.
   - `ans` is updated to include the new `sums`.

4. **General Iteration `i`**:
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
   - `ans` is updated to include the new `sums`.

5. **Final Iteration (`i = k`)**:
   - The same logic as above applies, but `i` reaches `k`.

### Final Output State:
After `k + 1` iterations, the loop will have computed `k + 1` values for `sums` and stored them in the list `ans`. The variable `sums` will hold the value computed in the last iteration (`i = k`).

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be:
- `t`: Remains unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, `x`: Remain unchanged.
- `a`: Remains unchanged.
- `sum1`: Remains unchanged.
- `ans`: Contains `k + 1` values of `sums` computed during each iteration.
- `sums`: Holds the value computed in the last iteration (`i = k`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed during each iteration, and `sums` holds the value computed in the last iteration (`i = k`).**
