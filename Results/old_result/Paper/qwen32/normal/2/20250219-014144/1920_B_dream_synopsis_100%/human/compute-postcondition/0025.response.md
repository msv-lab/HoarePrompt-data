The code snippet increments the variable `sums` by the value of `a[i - 1]`. Given that `a` is a list of integers and `i` is already incremented before this line, `a[i - 1]` refers to the current element being processed in the list `a`.

Since `sums` is part of the list `ans`, updating `sums` will also update the first (and only) element of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums + a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
