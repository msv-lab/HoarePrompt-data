To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve through each iteration. The loop runs `k + 1` times, and the variable `sums` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` when `i == 0`.
   - `ans` starts as an empty list and gets appended with the value of `sums` after each iteration.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - For `i > 0`, the value of `sums` is updated based on whether `i + x - 1` is less than `n` or not.
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After `k + 1` iterations, the list `ans` will contain `k + 1` values of `sums` computed according to the rules above.

Given the initial state and the nature of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are input parameters.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is only read and not modified.
- `sum1` remains unchanged as it is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `ans` will contain `k + 1` values of `sums` after all iterations.

Let's formalize this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed as per the loop logic.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `ans` will have `k + 1` elements, each representing the computed value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged.
