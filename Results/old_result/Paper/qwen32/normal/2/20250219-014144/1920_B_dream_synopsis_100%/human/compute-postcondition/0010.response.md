The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified.

Given that `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `ans` will contain one element, which is `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` must be at least 0, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, the current value of `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
