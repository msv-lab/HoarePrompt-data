The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, and `sums` remain unchanged except for `ans` which now includes the new appended value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `sums` (initial value and the newly appended value), `i` is 3, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`.**
