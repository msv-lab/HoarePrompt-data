Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicity of each sign and the requirement that each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. 

The given code consists of two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`), but neither of them addresses the problem correctly. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function appears to be designed to process a string of characters ('@' and '*') and calculate some value based on the sequence of these characters.
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute a score for the sequence, where '@' contributes positively and '*' contributes negatively.
   - This logic is entirely unrelated to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It assumes that each test case consists of a string (`path`) which is passed to `func_1`.
   - Since `func_1` does not solve the problem, calling it for each test case will not yield the correct results.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the occurrence of each sign based on its periodicity and ensure that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. A possible solution would involve iterating through the years and checking when each sign can occur next, keeping track of the current year as we go.

Correctness: **False**
