### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Misalignment**:
   - The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicities of the signs.
   - The provided code (`func_1` and `func_2`) appears to be designed for a different problem involving paths and scoring based on the presence of '@' and '*' symbols. This is evident from the logic in `func_1`, which uses dynamic programming to score a path, and the fact that `func_2` processes the input as a string of symbols rather than a list of integers.

2. **Incorrect Input Parsing**:
   - The input parsing in `func_2` is incorrect for the given problem. The periodicities should be parsed as a list of integers, but the current implementation treats them as a single string. This means that the logic for determining the occurrence years of the signs is never applied correctly.

3. **Lack of Correct Implementation**:
   - There is no part of the provided code that actually calculates the year in which each sign will occur based on its periodicity and the year the previous sign occurred. The core logic required to solve the problem is missing.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary provided for `func_2` does not accurately describe the intended functionality of the program. It suggests that `func_2` applies `func_1` to a string of space-separated integers, which is not what the code does. Instead, `func_2` attempts to process the input as a string of symbols.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
