### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. Specifically, once a sign occurs, we start waiting for the next sign from the year immediately following the current sign's occurrence.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. However, the problem description does not involve any paths with characters '@' and '*', nor does it require dynamic programming as implemented in `func_1`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be designed to solve a different problem, possibly related to some kind of path counting or optimization problem involving '@' and '*'. It uses dynamic programming to compute some value based on these characters.
   - Given the context of the problem, this function is irrelevant and incorrect for solving the given problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, applying it here does not solve the intended problem.

#### Correct Implementation:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the occurrence of each sign sequentially. For each sign, we find the next occurrence after the previous sign's occurrence year. Here's a correct implementation outline:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(signs):
    current_year = 0
    for period in signs:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(signs))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not applicable to the given problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
