To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `results`, so we need to ensure that `results` is properly defined and contains elements.

Here's the given state:
- `path` is `data[2*t]`
- `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`
- `t` is the integer value of `a_1`
- `index` is `1 + 2*t`
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for each iteration

The for loop statement is:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `results` contains at least one element.
- The variable `result` will take on each value from the `results` list during each iteration of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `results` is a non-empty list. This means `func_1(path)` should have been called at least once and its return value stored in `results`.
- Since `path` is defined as `data[2*t]`, we need to ensure that `2*t` is a valid index for the list `data`.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Ensure `t` is a valid index**: Since `t` is derived from `a_1`, which is the first element of `data`, and assuming `a_1` is a valid integer, `t` should be a non-negative integer.
2. **Ensure `2*t` is within bounds of `data`**: The length of `data` is `n`, so `2*t` must be less than `n`.
3. **Populate `results`**: Since `results` is supposed to contain the return values of `func_1(path)`, we need to call `func_1(path)` at least once and store its return value in `results`.

Given these points, let's define the state:

- `data` must have at least one element, and `a_1` should be a valid integer such that `2*t` is a valid index in `data`.
- `results` must contain at least one element, which is the return value of `func_1(path)`.

### Final State:
State: **`data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']` where `a_1` is a valid integer such that `2*t` is a valid index in `data`, `t` is the integer value of `a_1`, `path` is `data[2*t]`, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list containing at least one element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`**
