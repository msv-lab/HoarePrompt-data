The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`. Given that `index` is 4, `path` will now hold the value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`path` is `data[4]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1; `index` is 4; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2` (which is assumed to be 2 if `data[1]` is `'2'`).**
