Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1; `index` is 4; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2` (which is assumed to be 2 if `data[1]` is `'2'`).**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
