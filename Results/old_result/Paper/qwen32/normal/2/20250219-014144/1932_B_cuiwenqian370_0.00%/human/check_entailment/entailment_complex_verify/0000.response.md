### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **accurate**. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description Misalignment**:
   - The problem requires calculating the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicities of each sign.
   - The provided program (`func_1` and `func_2`) does not address this requirement. Instead, it appears to be solving a different problem involving sequences of symbols ('@' and '*') and scoring them using dynamic programming.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` is designed to process a sequence of characters and calculate a score based on the presence of '@' and '*' symbols. This logic is unrelated to the problem of determining the occurrence years of the signs of the apocalypse.

3. **Input Parsing Issues in `func_2`**:
   - The input parsing in `func_2` is incorrect for the given problem. The program treats the periodicities as a single string rather than a list of integers, which is not how the problem specifies the input should be handled.

4. **Lack of Implementation for Core Problem**:
   - The provided code does not include any logic to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities. This core functionality is missing.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to implement a function that iteratively calculates the year of each sign's occurrence based on its periodicity and the year the previous sign occurred. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(periodicities):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periodicities:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periodicities = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periodicities))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct because the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program's logic and input handling are mismatched with the requirements of the problem.

**Final: False**
