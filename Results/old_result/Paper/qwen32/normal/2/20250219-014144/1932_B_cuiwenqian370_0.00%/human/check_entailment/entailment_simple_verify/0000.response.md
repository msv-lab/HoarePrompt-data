### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues using the annotated code and the problem description:

1. **Misalignment with Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicities of the signs.
   - The provided code (`func_1` and `func_2`) is designed to handle a completely different problem involving paths and symbols ('@' and '*'). It uses dynamic programming to score these paths, which is unrelated to the problem at hand.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - `func_1` is designed to process a path of symbols and calculate a score based on the presence of '@' and '*'. This logic is entirely unrelated to calculating the occurrence years of the signs of the apocalypse.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not involve any calculations related to periodicities or years, which are central to the problem.

3. **Input Parsing Issues**:
   - In `func_2`, the input parsing is incorrect. The periodicities of the signs are read as a single string rather than being converted into a list of integers. This would lead to incorrect processing and results.
   - The code does not correctly parse the input to extract the periodicities for each test case, which is essential for solving the problem.

4. **Lack of Implementation for Core Problem**:
   - There is no implementation in the provided code that calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities. The core logic required to solve the problem is missing.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to implement a function that iteratively calculates the year of each sign's occurrence based on its periodicity and the year the previous sign occurred. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(periodicities):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periodicities:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periodicities = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periodicities))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described and contains significant logical and parsing errors.

**Final: False**
