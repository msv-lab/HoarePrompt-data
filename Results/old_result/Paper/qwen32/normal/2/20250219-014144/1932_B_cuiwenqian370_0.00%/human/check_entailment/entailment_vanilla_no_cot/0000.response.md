Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the given periodicities of the signs. Instead, `func_1` seems to be solving a different problem related to counting occurrences of a specific character ('@') in a sequence while avoiding another character ('*'). The main function `func_2` reads input but incorrectly passes a string to `func_1` instead of a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
