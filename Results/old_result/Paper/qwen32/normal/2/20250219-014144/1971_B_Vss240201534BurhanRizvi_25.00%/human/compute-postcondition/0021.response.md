In the given initial state, we have:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `s2` is a permutation of the original string `s`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
