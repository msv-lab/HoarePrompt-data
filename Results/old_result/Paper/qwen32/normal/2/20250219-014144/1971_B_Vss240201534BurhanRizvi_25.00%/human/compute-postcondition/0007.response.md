Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.
- `s` is equal to `s2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
