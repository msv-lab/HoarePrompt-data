To determine what will be printed by the `print(s2)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This variable does not directly affect the output of `print(s2)`.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`, meaning it contains the same characters as `s` but possibly in a different order.
- `s` is not equal to `s2`, implying that `s2` is a non-trivial permutation of `s`.

Given these conditions, the output of `print(s2)` will be the specific permutation of the string `s` that is stored in `s2`. Since the exact value of `s2` is not explicitly provided, we can only describe it in terms of being a permutation of `s` that is not identical to `s`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **s2 (where s2 is a permutation of the string s that is not equal to s)**
