Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the input string `s`. While this approach may work for many cases, it is not guaranteed to produce a different string `s2` from `s` in every case. Specifically, if the input string consists of identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the random permutation will always result in the same string, leading to an incorrect output of "No" when the correct output should be "NO".

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
aaaaa
```
The program might output:
```
No
aaaaa
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
NO
```
Since no rearrangement of "aaaaa" can produce a different string, the program should correctly identify this case and output "NO". The current implementation does not handle this edge case properly, making it incorrect.
