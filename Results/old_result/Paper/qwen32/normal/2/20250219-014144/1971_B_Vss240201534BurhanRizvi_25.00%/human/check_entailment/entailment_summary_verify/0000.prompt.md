You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then generates a random permutation of `s` and checks if the permuted string `s2` is different from the original string `s`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by the permuted string; otherwise, it prints "No". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the input string `s`. While this approach may work for many cases, it is not guaranteed to produce a different string `s2` from `s` in every case. Specifically, if the input string consists of identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the random permutation will always result in the same string, leading to an incorrect output of "No" when the correct output should be "NO".

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
aaaaa
```
The program might output:
```
No
aaaaa
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
NO
```
Since no rearrangement of "aaaaa" can produce a different string, the program should correctly identify this case and output "NO". The current implementation does not handle this edge case properly, making it incorrect.
