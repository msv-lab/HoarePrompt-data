You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then generates a random permutation of `s` and checks if the permuted string `s2` is different from the original string `s`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by the permuted string; otherwise, it prints "No". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If it's impossible to do so, we need to report that it's impossible.
   
2. **Constraints**:
   - There are up to 1000 test cases.
   - Each string `s` has a length of at most 10.
   - The string consists of lowercase English letters.

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - For each test case, output "YES" followed by the rearranged string `r` if a valid rearrangement exists.
   - Output "NO" if no valid rearrangement exists.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program uses the `random.sample()` function to shuffle the characters of the input string `s` and checks if the shuffled string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.

#### Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Shuffling**: For each string `s`, it generates a shuffled version `s2` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
3. **Comparison**: It compares the original string `s` with the shuffled string `s2`.
4. **Output**: 
   - If `s` and `s2` are different, it prints "YES" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s` and `s2` are the same, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Case 1**: When the string `s` has all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the shuffled string `s2` will always be the same as `s`. Therefore, the program correctly outputs "NO" in these cases.
- **Case 2**: When the string `s` has at least two different characters, there is a high probability that the shuffled string `s2` will be different from `s`. However, due to the nature of randomness, there is still a small chance that `s2` could be the same as `s`. This means that while the program is likely to produce a correct answer, it is not guaranteed to do so every time.

### Conclusion:

While the program works correctly in most cases, it relies on randomness, which means there is a non-zero probability that it might incorrectly output "NO" for strings that have valid rearrangements. To ensure correctness with certainty, a deterministic approach should be used instead of relying on randomness.

Correctness: **False**
