The code snippet appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. This means that `tree` now includes an additional element which is `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `tree` has an additional element `u` and `v` appended to it, `i` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `v` has been added to the `tree` list, which already had `u` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
