Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of edges represented as pairs of integers `(u, v)` describing the connections between nodes, and an integer `u_1` representing the initial node where a stone is placed. The function returns the number of steps required to move the stone from the initial node `u_1` to the other leaf node in the tree.**
