The given code snippet reads a pair of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state except for updating the values of `u` and `v`.

Given the initial state, the only changes occur to `u` and `v` as they are reassigned based on the input. The rest of the variables (`n`, `t`, `empty`, `u_1`, `tree`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `tree` remains unchanged, `i` is 1**.
