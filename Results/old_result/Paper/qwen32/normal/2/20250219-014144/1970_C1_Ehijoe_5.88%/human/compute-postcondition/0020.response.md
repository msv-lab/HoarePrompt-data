The code appends the value of `v` to the `tree` deque. This means that the `tree` deque, which was initially empty, now contains one element, which is `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `tree` is a deque containing `[v]`, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, `u` is not equal to `tree[0]`, and the current value of `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`.**
