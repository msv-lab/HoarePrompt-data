The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, and `t` is initially set to 1. After executing the code, `n` and `t` will be reassigned based on the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, and the edges are provided as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed.**
