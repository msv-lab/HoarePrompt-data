n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, and the edges are provided as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed.
