The code snippet provided does not actually change any of the variables' values except for `empty`, which is set to `False`. However, the initial state already specifies that `empty` is `False`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `tree` has an additional element `u` and `v` appended to it, `i` is 1.**
