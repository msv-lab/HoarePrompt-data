The code appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. This means that `tree` now includes `v` as its last element. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `tree` now includes `v` as its last element.**
