```

This line of code sets the variable `empty` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is the value of `empty`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `tree` is a deque containing the elements `u` and `v`, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input.**
