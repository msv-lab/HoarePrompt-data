The provided code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. No other operations are performed in the given snippet, so the values of `t`, `x`, `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input; `x`, `l`, `r`, and `i` are unchanged.**
