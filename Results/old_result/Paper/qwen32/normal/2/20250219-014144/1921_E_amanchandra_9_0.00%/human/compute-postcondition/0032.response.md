The value of `l` is updated to be the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the newly read integers from the input; `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`; `r` is as calculated in the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**
