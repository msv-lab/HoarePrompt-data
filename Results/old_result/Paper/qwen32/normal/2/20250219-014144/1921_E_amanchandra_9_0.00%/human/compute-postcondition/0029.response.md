The given code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. This means the values of these variables will be updated based on the new input, while the values of `t`, `x`, `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the newly read integers from the input; `x`, `l`, `r` are as calculated in the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**
