Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the newly read integers from the input; `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true (i.e., `abs(xa - xb)` is odd), then `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`. Otherwise, `l` is `max(1, ya - abs(xa - xb) // 2)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.
