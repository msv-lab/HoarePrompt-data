You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the next t lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <=
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each iteration, the program reads six integers `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw". Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. Depending on whether `abs(xa - xb)` is odd or even, it sets `l` and `r` accordingly and checks if certain conditions related to `ya` and `yb` are met to determine whether to print "Alice" or "Bob". After all iterations, no further changes are made to the variables, and the program ends.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` (coordinates of two points). The function returns a result for each test case based on the given coordinates and dimensions, ensuring that the coordinates are valid and that the points are not the same.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
