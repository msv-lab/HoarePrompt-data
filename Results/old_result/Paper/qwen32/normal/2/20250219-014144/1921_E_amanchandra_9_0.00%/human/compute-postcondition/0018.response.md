The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, `l`, `r`, and `i`) but does not specify their exact values. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Draw**
