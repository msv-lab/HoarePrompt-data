Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify a problematic scenario:

### Code Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and determines the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The logic seems to be based on the relative positions and distances between the chips, but it does not fully account for all possible scenarios.

### Problematic Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
In this case:
- Alice starts at position (1, 1).
- Bob starts at position (2, 2).

According to the problem description:
- Alice can move to (2, 1), (2, 2), or (2, 0) (but (2, 0) is out of bounds).
- Bob can move to (1, 1), (1, 2), or (1, 0) (but (1, 0) is out of bounds).

Since Alice can move directly to Bob's position (2, 2) in her first move, Alice wins. However, the provided program will incorrectly output "Draw" for this case.

### Why the Program Fails:
The program uses a condition `if xa > xb:` to determine if the game is a draw, which is incorrect. The logic for determining the winner or if it's a draw should consider the actual possible moves and the relative positions more carefully.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly the scenario where Alice can win in her first move, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
