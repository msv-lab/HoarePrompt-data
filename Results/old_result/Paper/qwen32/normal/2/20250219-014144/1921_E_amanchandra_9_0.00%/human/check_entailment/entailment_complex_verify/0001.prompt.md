You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each iteration, the program reads six integers `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw". Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. Depending on whether `abs(xa - xb)` is odd or even, it sets `l` and `r` accordingly and checks if certain conditions related to `ya` and `yb` are met to determine whether to print "Alice" or "Bob". After all iterations, no further changes are made to the variables, and the program ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the dimensions of a grid (`h` and `w`) and the coordinates of two distinct points (`(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`). For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game between Alice and Bob based on their positions relative to each other and the grid boundaries. The possible results are "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

### Game Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start at different positions on a checkered board. They take turns moving their chips according to specific rules:

- Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right.
- Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right.

The game ends when:
- A player moves their chip to the same position as the opponent's chip, resulting in a win for that player.
- A player cannot make any more moves, resulting in a draw.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Positions**: The chips start at different positions.
2. **Movement Constraints**: Each player can only move within the board boundaries.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they can force their chip onto the opponent's chip's position.
4. **Drawing Condition**: If a player reaches the edge of the board without being able to capture the opponent's chip, the game ends in a draw.

### Strategy

The strategy revolves around the relative positions of Alice and Bob and their ability to reach each other's positions within the constraints of their movement.

- If Alice is initially above Bob (`xa < xb`), Alice can potentially move down towards Bob.
- If Alice is initially below Bob (`xa > xb`), Bob can potentially move up towards Alice.
- If Alice and Bob are on the same row (`xa == xb`), the game can only end in a draw because neither can move vertically towards the other.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

#### Case 1: `xa > xb`
- If Alice starts below Bob, the program immediately prints 'Draw'. This is incorrect because Alice could still potentially win if she can move up to Bob's position within the constraints.

#### Case 2: `xa <= xb`
- The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which represents half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
- If the distance is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Bob can be horizontally positioned such that Alice can potentially reach him.
- If the distance is even, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Alice can be horizontally positioned such that Bob can potentially reach her.
- The program then checks if Alice or Bob can reach the opponent's position within the calculated range and prints the winner accordingly.

### Conclusion

The program incorrectly handles the case where `xa > xb`. In this scenario, Alice should have the opportunity to win if she can move up to Bob's position within the constraints. Therefore, the program's logic is flawed.
