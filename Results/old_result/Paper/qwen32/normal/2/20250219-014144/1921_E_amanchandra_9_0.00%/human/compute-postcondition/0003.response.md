Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, with `xa` being greater than `xb`. However, the print statement provided does not depend on these variables directly. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers.
3. The specific values of these variables do not influence the output of the print statement.
4. The print statement is `print('Draw')`, which means it will always output the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Draw**
