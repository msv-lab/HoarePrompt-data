The code snippet `m = s.count('map')` updates the value of `m` to be the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
