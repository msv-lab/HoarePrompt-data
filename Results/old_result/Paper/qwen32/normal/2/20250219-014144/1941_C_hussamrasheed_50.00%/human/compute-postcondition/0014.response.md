Let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `s` is a new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `m` is initialized to 0.
- `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(m + p)
```

### Analysis:
- `m` is explicitly set to 0.
- `p` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`, where `s` is the original input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.

Given this information, the expression `m + p` simplifies to `0 + p`, which is just `p`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **p (where p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string s)**
