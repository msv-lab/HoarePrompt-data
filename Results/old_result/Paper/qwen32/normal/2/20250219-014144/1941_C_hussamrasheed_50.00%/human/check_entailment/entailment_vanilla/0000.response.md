Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful, where a string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". 

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (length of the string) and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It removes all occurrences of "map" from `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`.
   - After removal, it counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores this count in `p`.

3. **Output:**
   - It prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of deletions needed to remove all "map" and "pie" substrings.

#### Issues in the Program
- **Overcounting Deletions:** 
  - The program assumes that removing all "map" substrings first and then counting "pie" substrings in the remaining string is sufficient. However, this approach can lead to overcounting deletions because removing a "map" substring might create new "pie" substrings that were not present before.
  
- **Non-Optimal Solution:**
  - The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to make the string beautiful. The current solution does not guarantee this optimality because it does not consider the interactions between "map" and "pie" substrings properly.

### Example Analysis
Consider the string "mappppie":
- The program would count one "map" and two "pie" substrings, resulting in a total of three deletions.
- However, the optimal solution involves deleting only two characters (e.g., the first 'p' and the last 'p') to make the string beautiful.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with overcounting and non-optimality, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
