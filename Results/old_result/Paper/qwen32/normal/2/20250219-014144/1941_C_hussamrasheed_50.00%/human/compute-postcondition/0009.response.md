The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new integer value to `n` based on user input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `m`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
