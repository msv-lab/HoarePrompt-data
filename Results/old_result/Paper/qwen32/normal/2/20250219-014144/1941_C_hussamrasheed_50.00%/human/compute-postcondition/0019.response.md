The code snippet `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This affects the string `s` and potentially the count `m` which represents the number of times 'map' appears in `s`. After executing the code, `m` should be updated to reflect that there are no more occurrences of 'map' in `s`.

Given that `m` was initially the number of times 'map' appeared in `s`, after the replacement, `m` would be 0 because all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.

The variable `p`, which represents the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`, remains unchanged because the replacement of 'map' with an empty string does not affect the count of 'pie'.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
