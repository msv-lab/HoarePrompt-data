The code snippet `p = s.count('pie')` counts the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The string `s` is already modified to have all occurrences of 'map' removed.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `m` are defined. The only variable that changes is `p`, which is set to the count of 'pie' in the modified string `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
