The code snippet updates the value of `p` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, the value of `p` will be the count of 'pie' in this modified string.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
