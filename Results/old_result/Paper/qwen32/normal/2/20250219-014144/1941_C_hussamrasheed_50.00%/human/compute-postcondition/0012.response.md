The code snippet `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This operation affects the string `s` and potentially changes the value of `m`, which counts the number of times 'map' appeared in `s`. Since all occurrences of 'map' are removed, `m` will be set to 0 after the replacement.

The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
