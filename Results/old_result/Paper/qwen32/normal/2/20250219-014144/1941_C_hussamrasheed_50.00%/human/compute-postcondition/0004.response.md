The code snippet assigns the value of the count of the substring 'map' in the string `s` to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.**
