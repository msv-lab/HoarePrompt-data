Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s`, replacing "map" with an empty string, and then counting occurrences of "pie" again. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for overlapping substrings and does not ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated correctly.

For example, consider the string "mpaipiem". The program would count one "map" and one "pie", suggesting that two deletions are needed. However, only one deletion (removing the 'm' in "mpai") is actually required to make the string beautiful.

A correct solution would involve dynamic programming or another method to find the longest subsequence that does not contain "map" or "pie" and then calculating the number of deletions needed to achieve that subsequence.
