The code updates the value of `m` to the count of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
