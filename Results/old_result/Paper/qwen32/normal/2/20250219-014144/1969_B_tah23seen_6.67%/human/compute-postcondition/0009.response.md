The given code snippet initializes a variable `cost` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `sChar`, `s`, or `left`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0.**
