### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided code and compare them with the function summary and problem description.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Simulation of Cyclic Shifts**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, which does not simulate the cyclic shift operation described in the problem. A cyclic shift involves rotating a substring, not just swapping two characters.
   - The cost calculation `(right - left + 1)` is applied whenever a '0' and a '1' are swapped, but this does not reflect the cost of performing a cyclic shift on a substring.

2. **Handling of Multiple Swaps**:
   - The code only performs a single swap between the first '1' it encounters and the first '0' it encounters, and then continues searching for the next pair. This approach does not consider the possibility of performing multiple cyclic shifts on different substrings to achieve the desired sorted order.
   - For example, in the string "11000", the correct approach would involve multiple cyclic shifts, but the code does not account for this.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the string is already sorted or nearly sorted. For example, a string like "0011" would require no operations, but the code might incorrectly calculate a non-zero cost.

#### Comparison with Function Summary:
- The function summary states that the function calculates the total cost required to rearrange each string such that all '0's come before all '1's. However, the summary does not specify how the cost is calculated or that it simulates cyclic shifts.
- The provided code does not correctly simulate cyclic shifts and does not handle the cost calculation accurately for cyclic shifts.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve this problem correctly, one needs to identify the blocks of '1's and '0's in the string.
- Calculate the cost of moving each block of '1's to the end of the string using the minimum number of cyclic shifts.
- Sum up the costs of these operations to get the total minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code and the comparison with the function summary, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
