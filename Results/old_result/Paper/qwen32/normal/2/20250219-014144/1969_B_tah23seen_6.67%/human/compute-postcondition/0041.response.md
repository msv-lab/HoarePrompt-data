Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state right before it.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will execute as long as `left` is less than the length of the string `s` and the character at index `left` in `s` is not '1'.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`.
- `right` is the index of the first '0' after the initial '1' or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.
- `s` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'` must be true. However, since `left` is defined as "the index of the first '1' in `s`", the condition `s[left] != '1'` will always be false because `left` points to the first occurrence of '1'. Therefore, the loop cannot execute based on the given definition of `left`.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `left` points to a position where `s[left]` is not '1'. Since `left` is initially set to the index of the first '1', we need to change this definition for the purpose of making the loop execute.

Hereâ€™s how we can adjust the state:
- Change `left` to an index where `s[left]` is not '1'. This could be any index where the character is not '1', or an index that is out of bounds if `s` contains no characters other than '1'.

Since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`left` and `len(s)`), and considering that `len(s)` is fixed, we need to adjust `left`.

Let's assume `s` has at least one character that is not '1' (otherwise, the problem would be trivial as no such `left` could satisfy the condition). We can set `left` to the index of the first character that is not '1'.

Example Answer:
If `s` contains characters other than '1', we can set `left` to the index of the first character that is not '1'.
State: **`left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1'; `right` is the index of the first '0' after the initial '1' or the length of `s` if no '0' is found; `s` remains unchanged.**

If `s` contains only '1's, then no such `left` can satisfy the condition, and the loop cannot execute. However, based on the problem statement, we assume there is at least one character that is not '1'.
