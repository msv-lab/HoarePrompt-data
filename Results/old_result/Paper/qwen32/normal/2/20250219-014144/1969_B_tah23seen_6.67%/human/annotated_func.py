#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings where each string s consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order.

    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1

            left += 1
        
    #State: `s` is sorted with all '0's before all '1's, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' exists, `right` is the length of `s` if no '0' exists, and `cost` is the total accumulated cost of swaps.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total accumulated cost of swaps, which is represented by the variable `cost`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of binary strings (`sChar`) and calculates the total cost required to rearrange each string such that all '0's come before all '1's. The cost is determined by the number of swaps needed to achieve this configuration, and the function returns the accumulated cost for all strings in the list.
