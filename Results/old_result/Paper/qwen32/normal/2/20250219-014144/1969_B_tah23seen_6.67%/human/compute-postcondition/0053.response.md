Output State: **`right` is a valid index such that `s[right + 1]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so the new `right` points to the next index in the string `s`. The precondition that `s[right]` was not '0' before the increment means that `s[right + 1]` is now being checked to ensure it is also not '0'. All other conditions remain unchanged.
