Output State: **`left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`; `right` is `left + 3`; `s[right]` is '1'; `s` must have at least `right + 1` characters.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, making `right` equal to `left + 3`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
