To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Let's break down the given state:
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if there are no '1's.
- `right` is equal to `left`.
- If `s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'`, `cost` is increased by 1.
- `s` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `right < len(s)`**: This condition ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the string `s`. Since `right` is initialized to `left`, and `left` is either the index of the first '1' or the length of `s`, we need to ensure that `left` (and thus `right`) is less than the length of `s`.

2. **Condition `s[right] != '0'`**: This condition ensures that the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0'. Given that `right` starts at `left`, and `left` is the index of the first '1', this condition should naturally hold if `s` contains at least one '1'.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure `right < len(s)`, we need to make sure that `s` contains at least one '1'. If `s` does not contain any '1's, `left` would be set to `len(s)`, and the loop would not execute.
- To ensure `s[right] != '0'`, we need to confirm that the first occurrence of '1' (or the character at `left`) is not '0'. Since `left` is defined as the index of the first '1', this condition is inherently satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted such that `s` contains at least one '1'. If `s` does not contain any '1's, `left` would be equal to `len(s)`, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if there are no '1's; `right` is equal to `left`; `s` must contain at least one '1'**.
