You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations. Here is a detailed analysis of why the program is incorrect:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Cyclic Shifts**: The code attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, which does not accurately simulate the cyclic shift operation described in the problem statement. The cost calculation `(right - left + 1)` is applied whenever a '0' and a '1' are swapped, but this does not reflect the actual cost of performing a cyclic shift on a substring.

2. **Handling of Multiple Swaps**: The code does not handle multiple swaps correctly. It only performs a single swap between the first '1' it encounters and the first '0' it encounters, and then continues searching for the next pair. This approach does not consider the possibility of performing multiple cyclic shifts on different substrings to achieve the desired sorted order.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle cases where the string is already sorted or nearly sorted. For example, a string like "0011" would require no operations, but the code might incorrectly calculate a non-zero cost.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input string "11000":
- The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 9, as shown in the example.
- However, the provided code will likely not produce the correct result because it does not properly simulate the cyclic shift operations and their associated costs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one needs to consider the following:
- Identify the blocks of '1's and '0's in the string.
- Calculate the cost of moving each block of '1's to the end of the string using the minimum number of cyclic shifts.
- Sum up the costs of these operations to get the total minimum cost.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
