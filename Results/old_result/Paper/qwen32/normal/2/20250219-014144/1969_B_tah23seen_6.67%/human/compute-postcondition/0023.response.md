To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis of Conditions:
1. **`left < len(s)`**: This condition ensures that the index `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
2. **`s[left] != '1'`**: This condition ensures that the character at the index `left` in the list `s` is not '1'.

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is the position of the first '0' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.

### Required Adjustments:
Given that `left` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure that `s[0]` is not '1'. If `s[0]` is '1', the loop will not execute because the second condition `s[left] != '1'` will fail.

#### Case 1: `s[0]` is '0'
If `s[0]` is '0', then both conditions are satisfied (`left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`), and the loop can execute.

#### Case 2: `s[0]` is '1'
If `s[0]` is '1', then the second condition fails, and the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `s` such that `s[0]` is '0'.

### Conclusion:
To guarantee that the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that `s[0]` is '0'. Since `s` is derived from `sChar`, we can adjust `sChar` accordingly.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order with `s[0]` being '0'; `left` is 0; `right` is the position of the first '0' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.**
