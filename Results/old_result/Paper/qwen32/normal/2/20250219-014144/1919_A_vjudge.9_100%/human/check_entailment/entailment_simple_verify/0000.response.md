### Reasoning

To verify the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic and the annotations provided.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
The game's outcome hinges on whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd:
- If the difference is even, Bob wins.
- If the difference is odd, Alice wins.

This conclusion is based on the optimal strategies:
- When the difference is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
- When the difference is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" if even and "Alice" if odd.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program reads the inputs correctly and computes the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. It then correctly determines whether the difference is even or odd and prints the appropriate winner.

#### Verification:
Let's validate the logic using the annotations and the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - Absolute Difference: `|1 - 1| = 0` (even)
   - Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Program Output: "Bob" (correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - Absolute Difference: `|1 - 4| = 3` (odd)
   - Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Program Output: "Alice" (correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - Absolute Difference: `|5 - 3| = 2` (even)
   - Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Program Output: "Bob" (correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Absolute Difference: `|4 - 5| = 1` (odd)
   - Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Program Output: "Alice" (correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `a = 11`, `b = 9`
   - Absolute Difference: `|11 - 9| = 2` (even)
   - Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Program Output: "Bob" (correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `a = 83`, `b = 91`
   - Absolute Difference: `|83 - 91| = 8` (even)
   - Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Program Output: "Bob" (correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
   - Absolute Difference: `|1032 - 9307| = 8275` (odd)
   - Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Program Output: "Alice" (correct)

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
   - Absolute Difference: `|839204 - 7281| = 831923` (odd)
   - Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Program Output: "Alice" (correct)

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - Input: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - Absolute Difference: `|1000000000 - 1000000000| = 0` (even)
   - Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Program Output: "Bob" (correct)

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - Input: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
    - Absolute Difference: `|53110 - 2024| = 51086` (even)
    - Expected Output: "Bob"
    - Program Output: "Bob" (correct)

All test cases match the expected outcomes, confirming that the program correctly implements the logic based on the absolute difference being even or odd.

### Conclusion
The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategies described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
