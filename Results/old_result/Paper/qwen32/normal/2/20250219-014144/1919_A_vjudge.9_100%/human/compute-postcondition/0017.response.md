Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Regardless of whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd, `i` is incremented by 1.**
