The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `t` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
