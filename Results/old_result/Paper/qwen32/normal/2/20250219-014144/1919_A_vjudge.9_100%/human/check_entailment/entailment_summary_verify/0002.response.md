### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed analysis of the game mechanics and correctly identifies the key factor determining the winner: the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - When `a == b`, both players will always have the same number of coins, and Bob will make the last move, leading to Bob's victory.
   - When `a != b`:
     - If the difference `|a - b|` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring the difference remains odd after her turn. This strategy guarantees Alice's win.
     - If the difference `|a - b|` is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring the difference remains even after his turn. This strategy guarantees Bob's win.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each pair of `(a, b)` values.
   - It checks if the absolute difference `|a - b|` is even or odd using the condition `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob", which aligns with the game analysis.
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice", which also aligns with the game analysis.

Given this alignment, the program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both players and accurately determines the winner based on the initial conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
