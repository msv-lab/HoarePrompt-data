The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but it does not specify their exact values or how they influence the `print` statement. The `print` statement itself is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input, and the absolute difference between them is either even or odd.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are used within the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output will always be the string `'Alice'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **Alice**
