### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` based on the input values `x`. However, the logic used in the program is flawed. The program initializes the array `a` with `[1000]` and then iteratively appends values calculated by subtracting the corresponding `x_i` from the last element of `a`. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `i >= 2`.

Let's break down why the current logic is incorrect:
1. **Initialization**: The array `a` is initialized with `[1000]`, which means `a_1 = 1000`.
2. **Appending Elements**: For each `x_i`, the program calculates the next element `a_i` as `a_{i-1} - x_i`. This does not ensure that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.
3. **Reversing the Array**: The array is reversed before being printed, which further complicates the logic without addressing the core issue.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct the array `a` such that the modulo condition is satisfied. One straightforward way to do this is to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large value (e.g., `10^9`) and then set `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i` for `i >= 2`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed to be exactly `x_i` more than `a_{i-1}`.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
