The given code snippet reverses the list `a`. Therefore, the order of elements in `a` will be flipped.

Initial State: 
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers
- `a` is a list `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])]`
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`
- `line` is the newly input string
- `i` is `n`

After executing `a = a[::-1]`, the list `a` will be reversed. 

So, the new `a` will be `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), 1000 - T[0], 1000]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), 1000 - T[0], 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string; `i` is `n`**.
