The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2], 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + T[2] + T[3])]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string; `i` is 5**
