To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the list `a` and the variable `result`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration `i`, it appends to the list `a` the value `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`.
- After 2 iterations, `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1]]`.
- After 3 iterations, `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]]`.

Following this pattern, after `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each subsequent element is the previous element minus the corresponding element in `T`. Therefore, the final list `a` will be:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + T[2]), \ldots, 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + \cdots + T[n-2])] \]

The `result` variable is the space-separated string of the elements in `a`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string; `i` is `n`**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `a` will have `n` elements where each element is computed by subtracting the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements of `T` from 1000, starting with just 1000 as the first element. The `result` will be the space-separated string representation of this list `a`.
