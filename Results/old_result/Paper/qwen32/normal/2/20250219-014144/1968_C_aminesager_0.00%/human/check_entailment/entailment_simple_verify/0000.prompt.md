You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0; no further iterations occur; the final `result` printed for each iteration is a space-separated string of `n` integers where each integer is calculated as 1000 minus the cumulative sum of the first (i-1) elements of `T`, in reverse order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Let's analyze the code and see why it fails:

### Code Analysis:
1. The program initializes `a` with `[1000]`.
2. It then iterates through the input list `T` (which contains `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`) and appends `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to `a`.
3. Finally, it reverses the list `a` and prints it.

### Issues:
1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:** The initial value of `a[0]` is set to `1000`, which is arbitrary and may not satisfy the condition `x_2 = a_2 % a_1`.
2. **Calculation of `a[i]`:** The formula `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]` is incorrect. The problem requires `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`, which means `a_i` should be chosen such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`. The current implementation does not ensure this.
3. **Reversing the List:** Reversing the list `a` at the end is unnecessary and incorrect since the order of elements in `a` matters.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The correct output could be something like `2 3 4` because:
- `3 % 2 = 1`
- `4 % 3 = 1`

However, the provided code will produce:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 - 1 = 999`
- `a[2] = 999 - 1 = 998`
- Reversed `a` would be `[998, 999, 1000]`, which does not satisfy the conditions.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the problem's requirements for generating the array `a`.
