To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it appends a new element to the list `a`, which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` (though `t` is not used in the loop).
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 500.
   - `x` is a list of `n-1` integers.
   - `T` is a list of integers converted from a space-separated string `line`.
   - `a` is initialized as `[1000]`.
   - `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`.
   - `line` is a string.
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - In each iteration, the new value for `a` is computed as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` and appended to `a`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `a` will have `n` elements.
   - The first element of `a` is always `1000`.
   - Each subsequent element is computed based on the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`.

Let's formalize the final state:

- `a` will be a list with `n` elements.
- The first element of `a` is `1000`.
- The second element of `a` is `1000 - T[0]`.
- The third element of `a` is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`.
- This pattern continues until the last element of `a`, which is `1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]`.

Thus, the final state of `a` can be described as:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], \ldots, 1000 - T[0] - T[1] - \ldots - T[n-2]] \]

The `result` variable, which is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`, will reflect this final list.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **a is a list with n elements where the i-th element (starting from 1) is 1000 minus the sum of the first (i-1) elements of T; result is a space-separated string of the elements in a.**
