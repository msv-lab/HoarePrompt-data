Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. The list `odds` contains the sums of certain subarrays of a palindrome array `a`, and `n` represents the length of the palindrome array `a` (where 3 <= n <= 1000). The function returns the palindrome array `a` that is constructed from the sums in the list `odds` and maintains symmetry around its center.**
