### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` collectively solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all possible subarray sums of a given list `a` and returns them in sorted order.
   - It iterates through each element in the list and computes cumulative sums from that element to the end of the list.
   - The function correctly generates all subarray sums and sorts them, which is necessary for further processing.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes a list `cts` to remove any element that has an immediate duplicate.
   - It iterates through the list and keeps track of elements that do not have an immediate duplicate.
   - This step is crucial because the problem specifies that all but one subarray sum is provided, so the list should contain exactly one element that appears an odd number of times.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums `odds`.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` and fills it based on the differences between consecutive elements in `odds`.
   - The function ensures that the resulting array is a palindrome by setting symmetric positions to the same value.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function compares two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`, and removes matching elements from the end of both lists until they no longer match or `smallList` is empty.
   - It returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.
   - This function is used to identify the missing subarray sum by comparing the complete list of subarray sums with the provided list.

### Verification of Logic:

- **Sorting Subarray Sums:** The program sorts the subarray sums, which is necessary to identify the missing sum.
- **Identifying Unique Sums:** By removing pairs of identical sums, the program isolates the missing sum.
- **Reconstructing the Array:** The program reconstructs the palindrome array using the identified unique sums.
- **Finding the Missing Sum:** The comparison function helps in identifying the missing sum by removing common elements from the end of the lists.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps implemented in the functions, the program appears to correctly reconstruct the palindrome array from the provided subarray sums. The functions work together to identify the missing sum and then use it to construct the array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
