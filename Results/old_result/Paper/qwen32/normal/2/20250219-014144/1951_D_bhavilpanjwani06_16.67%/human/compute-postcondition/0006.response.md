Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- For each of the remaining `t-1` test cases, there are two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
- Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- In the current test case, `n` is equal to `k`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Since the print statement is hardcoded to print `1`, the output will be `1`.

Output: **1**
