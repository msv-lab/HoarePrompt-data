Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each of the remaining \(t-1\) test cases, there are two positive integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- Additionally, \(n\) is greater than or equal to \(k\).
- In the current test case, \(n\) is equal to \(k\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Explanation:
The output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. The string `'YES'` is hardcoded and will be printed as is.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
