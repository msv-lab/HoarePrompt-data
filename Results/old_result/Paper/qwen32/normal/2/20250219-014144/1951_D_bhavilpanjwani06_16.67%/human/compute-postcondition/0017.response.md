Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the remaining t-1 test cases, there are two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. If the current value of `n` is less than `k`, then no specific change is made to `n` or `k` for the current test case. Otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` equals `k`, no specific change is made to `n` or `k`. If `n` is greater than `k`, then either `k - 1 < n - k + 1` or `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
