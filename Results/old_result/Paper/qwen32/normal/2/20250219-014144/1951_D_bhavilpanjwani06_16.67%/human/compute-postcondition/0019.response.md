Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of integers and the integers themselves if certain conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Specifically, if `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by `1` and `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', followed by `2`, `n - k + 1`, and `1`. In all other cases, it prints 'NO'.**
