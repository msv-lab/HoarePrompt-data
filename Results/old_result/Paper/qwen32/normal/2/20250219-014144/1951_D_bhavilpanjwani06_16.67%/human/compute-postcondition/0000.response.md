The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and for each test case, there are two positive integers `n` and `k`, the code will read these two integers for one test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the remaining t-1 test cases, there are two positive integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input for the current test case.**
