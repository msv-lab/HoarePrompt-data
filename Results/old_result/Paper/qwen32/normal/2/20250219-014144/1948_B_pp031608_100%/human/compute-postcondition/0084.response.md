The code snippet provided modifies the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`.
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
- `i` is `m - 3`.
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.

After executing the line `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`, the value of `arr[i - 1]` changes to `nums[0]`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` now set to `nums[0]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`; `i` is `m - 3`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.**
