Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers potentially modified based on the conditions inside the loop; `ans` is False if any `nums` formed during the loop is not sorted, otherwise `ans` is True**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to the integer value of the next input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
