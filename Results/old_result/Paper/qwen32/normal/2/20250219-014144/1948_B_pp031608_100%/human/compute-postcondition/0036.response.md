The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by concatenating two parts: the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (converted to integers) and the integer `arr[i]`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, or `ans`. It only introduces a new list `nums`.

Given that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the exact values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` are not specified, but we know that `nums` will consist of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer such that m ≥ 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is True; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
