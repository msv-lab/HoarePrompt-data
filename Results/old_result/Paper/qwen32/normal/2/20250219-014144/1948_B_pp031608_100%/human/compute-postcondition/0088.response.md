Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; the loop has executed `n` times, with `m` being an input integer and `arr` being a list of integers provided by the user input, potentially modified if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is sorted; `ans` is True if all `nums` formed during the loop iterations were sorted, otherwise `ans` is False for each iteration, and the program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the value of `ans`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed `n` sets of input data (`m` and `arr`). For each set, it checks if certain conditions are met (specifically, if `nums` is sorted when `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`). It prints 'YES' if all `nums` lists formed during the checks are sorted, otherwise 'NO'. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
