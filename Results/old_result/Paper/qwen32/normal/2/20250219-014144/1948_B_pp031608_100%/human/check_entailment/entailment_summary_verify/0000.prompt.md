You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks a list of integers to determine if a specific condition is met: when any integer in the list is less than the preceding integer, the digits of the preceding integer along with the current integer should form a sorted sequence. If this condition holds for all such pairs in the list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation where we take any element `a[i]` that is at least 10, delete it, and insert its digits in the same position.
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the above operation any number of times.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds an element `arr[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i]`, it attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting sequence is sorted. If it is not, it marks the answer as `False`. Otherwise, it updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting**: The program only checks if the sequence formed by splitting `arr[i-1]` and appending `arr[i]` is sorted. However, it does not consider further splits that might be necessary to achieve a fully sorted array.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are required to sort the array. It only checks a single split and moves on.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
12 3 21 4
```
- Initially, `arr = [12, 3, 21, 4]`.
- The program will check `arr[3]` and `arr[2]`: `4 < 21` is true, so it splits `21` into `[2, 1]` and appends `4`, resulting in `[2, 1, 4]`. This sequence is not sorted, so the program incorrectly concludes that sorting is not possible.
- However, if we split `12` into `[1, 2]` first, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 21, 4]`, and then we can split `21` into `[2, 1]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]`. Further rearrangement can lead to a sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where multiple splits are required to sort the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to consider scenarios where multiple splits are necessary to achieve a sorted array. It only checks a single split and moves on, which can lead to incorrect conclusions about the possibility of sorting the array.
