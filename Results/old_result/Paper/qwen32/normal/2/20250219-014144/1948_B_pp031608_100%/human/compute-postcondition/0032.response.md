The given code snippet reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `arr`. This means that `arr` is now populated with the integers provided by the user input.

The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, and `ans` have certain properties and values. After executing the code snippet, only `arr` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is False if any `nums` formed during the loop is not sorted, otherwise `ans` is True**

In simpler terms, `arr` now contains the integers from the user input, while all other variables retain their initial values and properties.
