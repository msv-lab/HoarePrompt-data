### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. When it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it checks if the digits of the previous element followed by the current element form a sorted sequence. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem requirements.

The key issue with the code is that it only checks the immediate pair of elements and their digit expansion, but it does not consider the possibility of performing multiple operations on different elements or the impact of those operations on the entire array. The correct approach should involve checking if the array can be sorted by potentially breaking down multiple elements into their digits and rearranging them.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the provided code is incorrect:
1. **Limited Scope of Check**: The code only checks if the digits of the preceding element and the current element form a sorted sequence when the current element is smaller than the previous one. This does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted after performing the allowed operations.
2. **No Comprehensive Transformation**: The code does not attempt to transform the array comprehensively by breaking down multiple elements and checking if the resulting array is sorted.
3. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Operations**: The code does not account for the fact that multiple elements might need to be broken down and rearranged to achieve a sorted array.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
