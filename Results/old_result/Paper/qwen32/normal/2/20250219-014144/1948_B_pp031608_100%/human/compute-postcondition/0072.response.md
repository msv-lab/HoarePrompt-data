The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive) with a decrement of `1` in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than `0`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1` to continue the loop.

So, if `i` was `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` is True unless it was previously set to False. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True unless it was already False, `i` is `m - 2`**
