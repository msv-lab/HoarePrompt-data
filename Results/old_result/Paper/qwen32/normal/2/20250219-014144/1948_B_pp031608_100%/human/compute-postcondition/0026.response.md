The given code snippet modifies the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and must be at least 2.
- `arr` is modified such that `arr[i - 1]` (which is `arr[0]` since `i` is 1) is now equal to `nums[0]`.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is 1.
- `nums` remains unchanged as it is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of only if `nums` is not sorted.

Given these points, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain the same; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`; `ans` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
