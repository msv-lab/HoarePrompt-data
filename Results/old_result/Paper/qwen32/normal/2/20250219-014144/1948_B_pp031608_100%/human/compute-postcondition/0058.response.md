To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the code:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n` is an integer input by the user, ranging from 2 to 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and 99.
- `m` is an integer input by the user.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, which might be modified.
- `ans` is a boolean value (True or False) that indicates whether any `nums` list was unsorted.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This line uses a list indexing trick to select between 'NO' and 'YES'. If `ans` is `False`, it will print 'NO' because `False` is equivalent to 0 in a boolean context, and `['NO', 'YES'][0]` is 'NO'. Conversely, if `ans` is `True`, it will print 'YES' because `True` is equivalent to 1 in a boolean context, and `['NO', 'YES'][1]` is 'YES'.

Therefore, the output depends on the value of `ans`.

Output: **'NO' if ans is False, 'YES' if ans is True**
