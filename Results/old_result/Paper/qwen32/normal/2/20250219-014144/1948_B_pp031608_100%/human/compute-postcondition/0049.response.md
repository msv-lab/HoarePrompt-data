Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer such that m ≥ 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `i` is 2. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`; `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `nums`.**
