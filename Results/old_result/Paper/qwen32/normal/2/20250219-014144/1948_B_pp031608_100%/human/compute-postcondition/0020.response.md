Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split and converted to integers; `nums` is a list formed by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the integer `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`; `i` is 1. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is set to `nums[0]` and `nums` consists of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False.**
