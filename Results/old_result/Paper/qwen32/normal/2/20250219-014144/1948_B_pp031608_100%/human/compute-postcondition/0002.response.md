Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is now set to the integer input by the user, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
