To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop's header. The loop header is:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
```

This indicates that the loop will iterate over a range starting from `m - 1` down to `1`, decrementing by `1` each time. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to `1`.
2. This implies that `m` must be at least `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `ans` is True

The only variable in the loop header that can be adjusted is `m`. To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be at least `2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is True**
