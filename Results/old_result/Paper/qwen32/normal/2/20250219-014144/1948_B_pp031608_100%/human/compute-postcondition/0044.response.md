The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by taking the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in the list `arr` and appending the integer at index `i` in the list `arr`. Here, `i` is initially 2.

Let's break down the changes:
- `nums` is created by converting `arr[i-1]` (which is `arr[1]`) into its individual digits and then appending `arr[i]` (which is `arr[2]`).

Given that `i` is 2, the list `nums` will be formed using `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer such that m ≥ 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `i` is 2; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`.**

In simpler terms, `nums` now contains the digits of the second element in `arr` followed by the third element in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
