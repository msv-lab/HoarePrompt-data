Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Bob aims to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns under the following conditions:
- The first `k` buns are sold at prices decreasing from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

### Program Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that:
     - We do not attempt to sell more buns at the modified price than available (`n`).
     - We do not set `k` higher than the difference between `b` and `a` because the price cannot drop below 1.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a` since the modified pricing does not offer a benefit.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This calculates the revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the logic with the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Expected Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`
   - Expected Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Expected Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
   - Expected Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0`
   - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
   - Expected Output: `10^18` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0`
   - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
   - Expected Output: `10^18` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 499499 + 1 = 500500`
   - Expected Output: `500500` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After verifying the program with the provided test cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns under the given conditions. The calculations align with the expected results for each test case.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
