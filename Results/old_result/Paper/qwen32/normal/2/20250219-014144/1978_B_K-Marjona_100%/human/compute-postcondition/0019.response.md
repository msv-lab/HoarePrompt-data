Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. Regardless of whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `k` is correctly computed as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
