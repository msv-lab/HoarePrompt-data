Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

Here is the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Key Points to Check

1. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference between `b` and `a`.

2. **Handling `b <= a`:**
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.

3. **Handling `b > a`:**
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the program calculates the profit by selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `b * k` gives the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
     - `(n - k) * a` gives the total revenue from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
   - Profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `1000000000 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `1000000000 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided test cases, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case according to the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement for calculating the maximum profit. It considers both scenarios (`b <= a` and `b > a`) and computes the profit accordingly.
