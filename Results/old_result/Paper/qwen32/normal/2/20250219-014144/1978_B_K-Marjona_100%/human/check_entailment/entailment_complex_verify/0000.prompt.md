You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each representing the result of the computation for each test case based on the given logic.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b` to determine the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

Here is the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Key Points to Check

1. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference between `b` and `a`.

2. **Handling `b <= a`:**
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.

3. **Handling `b > a`:**
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the program calculates the profit by selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `b * k` gives the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
     - `(n - k) * a` gives the total revenue from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
   - Profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `1000000000 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `1000000000 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided test cases, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case according to the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement for calculating the maximum profit. It considers both scenarios (`b <= a` and `b > a`) and computes the profit accordingly.
