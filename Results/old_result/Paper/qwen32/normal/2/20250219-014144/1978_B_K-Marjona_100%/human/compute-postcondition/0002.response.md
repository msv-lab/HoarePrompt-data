The value of `k` is assigned the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**
