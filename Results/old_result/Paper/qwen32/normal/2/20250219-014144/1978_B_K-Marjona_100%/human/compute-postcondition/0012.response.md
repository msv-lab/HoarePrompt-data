To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the expression step by step using the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `n`: The first integer read from the input.
   - `a`: The second integer read from the input.
   - `b`: The third integer read from the input.
   - `k`: The minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b * k`: Multiplies `b` by `k`.
   - `k * (k - 1) // 2`: Calculates the sum of the first \(k-1\) integers (triangular number formula).
   - `(n - k) * a`: Multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

3. **Putting it all together:**
   - The expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` combines these three parts:
     - `b * k` scales `b` by `k`.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` subtracts the sum of the first \(k-1\) integers from the previous result.
     - `(n - k) * a` adds the product of the remaining count (`n - k`) and `a`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final result depends on the specific values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`.
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the formula in terms of these variables.

Given this breakdown, the output will be the result of the formula described above. Therefore, the precise description of the output is:

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a)**
