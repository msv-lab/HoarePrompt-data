The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and that `input()` returns `t`. However, the code snippet does not use `t` and instead reads new values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input.**
