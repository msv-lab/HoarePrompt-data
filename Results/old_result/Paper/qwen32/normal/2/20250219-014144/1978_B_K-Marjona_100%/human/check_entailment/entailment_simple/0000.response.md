### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify if it correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Determine Optimal `k`:**
   - The variable `k` is set to `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference between `b` and `a`, which is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a decreasing price before the price drops below the usual price `a`.

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means selling the buns at the modified price is not beneficial, so the program calculates the total profit by selling all buns at the usual price `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the total profit as follows:
     - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series where the prices start from `b` and decrease by 1 for each subsequent bun.
     - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a * (n - k)`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the calculated maximum profit.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`

- **Test Case 5:** `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

- **Test Case 6:** `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

- **Test Case 7:** `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`

All test cases match the expected results, indicating that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
