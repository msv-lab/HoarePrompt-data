To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable seems to represent the number of test cases but is not directly used in the given print statement.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `a` is the second integer read from the input.
- `b` is the third integer read from the input.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. However, `k` is not used in the print statement.

The `print(a * n)` statement will multiply the integer `a` by the integer `n` and print the result. Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer read from the input and n is the first integer read from the input)**
