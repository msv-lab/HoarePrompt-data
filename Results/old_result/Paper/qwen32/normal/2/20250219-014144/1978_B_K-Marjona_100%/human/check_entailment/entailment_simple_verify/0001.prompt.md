You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. He can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that:
- The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total revenue.

### Program Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is because:
     - If `b - a` is greater than `n`, then we can't sell more than `n` buns at the modified price.
     - If `b - a` is less than `n`, then we can only sell up to `b - a` buns at the modified price because the price cannot go below 1.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means selling at the modified price doesn't give any advantage, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This part calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This part calculates the revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the logic with the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0`
   - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0`
   - Profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 499499 + 1 = 50050
