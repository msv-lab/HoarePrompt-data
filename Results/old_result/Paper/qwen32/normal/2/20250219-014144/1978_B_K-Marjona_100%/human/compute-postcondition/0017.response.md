To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * n)`, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

However, the variable `k` is not used in the print statement, so we only need to focus on `a` and `n`.

The print statement `print(a * n)` multiplies the integer `a` by the integer `n` and prints the result.

Given that the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers read from the input)**
