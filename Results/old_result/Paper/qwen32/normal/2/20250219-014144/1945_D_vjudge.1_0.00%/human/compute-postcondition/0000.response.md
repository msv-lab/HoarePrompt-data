The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` (which were positive integers) are now replaced by the new values read from the input.

Since the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are not modified by this code snippet, they retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a list of n integers, `lista_B` is a list of n integers.**
