The code snippet provided updates the value of `lista_A` by reading a line of input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and then storing these integers in a list. The values of `n`, `k`, and `lista_B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is a list of n integers.**
