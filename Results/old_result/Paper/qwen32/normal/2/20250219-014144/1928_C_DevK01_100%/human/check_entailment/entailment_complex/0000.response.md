### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy the given conditions for Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` during the settling process. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program first checks if `(n + x) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `0` because it's impossible for the settling pattern to match the given `n` and `x` under these conditions.
   - If `(n + x) % 2 == 0`, it proceeds to find possible values of `k`.

2. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` (if `n >= 3 * x - 2`) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - These divisors represent potential values of `k` because the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the number `x` at position `n` must align with one of these patterns.

3. **Divisor Calculation**:
   - Inside `func_1`, it calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it's an integer and meets the condition `w >= x - 1`.
   - It then iterates through all integers `i` from `1` to `w` to find divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients if they meet the same condition.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program combines the results from both calls to `func_1` (if applicable), removes duplicates using `set`, and prints the count of unique possible `k` values.

### Analysis:

- The logic for checking `(n + x) % 2` is correct because the settling pattern requires `n + x` to be even.
- The divisor calculation in `func_1` correctly identifies potential values of `k` based on the pattern's periodicity.
- The use of `set` ensures that duplicate values of `k` are not counted multiple times.
- The overall approach is sound and should work within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
