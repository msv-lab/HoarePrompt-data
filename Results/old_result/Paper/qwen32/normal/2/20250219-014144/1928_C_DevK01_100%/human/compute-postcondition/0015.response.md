The code snippet increments the variable `i` by 1. This affects only the variable `i`, and no other variables are modified by this operation.

Given the initial state, `q` remains unchanged, and the conditions for defining `M` remain the same. The only change is in the value of `i`.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)` representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and x must be at least 2. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0 and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the single element `[1]`. Otherwise, `M` is not defined. `i` is increased by 1.**
