You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If w is an integer such that w is equal to its integer division by 1 and w is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the single element w. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `M` contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients if they are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. `i` is equal to the length of `q`.
    return M
    #The program returns `M`, which contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The function also accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `M`, which contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
