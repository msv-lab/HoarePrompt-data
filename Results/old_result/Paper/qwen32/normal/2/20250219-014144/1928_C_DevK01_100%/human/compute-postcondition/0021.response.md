Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `w` must be at least `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` includes the new element `i`. Additionally, if `q[0][1] // i >= x - 1`, `M` now includes the new element `q[0][1] // i`. If `q % i != 0`, no changes are made to `M`.**
