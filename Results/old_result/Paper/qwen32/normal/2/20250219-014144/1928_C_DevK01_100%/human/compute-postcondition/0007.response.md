It appears there might be a small mistake in the provided if condition. The condition `(q % i == 0)` suggests that `q` is being used as an integer, but according to the precondition, `q` is a list of tuples. To proceed correctly, let's assume the intention was to check the length of the list `q` modulo `i`. Therefore, the corrected if condition would be:

```python
if (len(q) % i == 0):
```

Given this correction, here is the postcondition:

Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and x must be at least 2. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. `i` is 1. The length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0.**
