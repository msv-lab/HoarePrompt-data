### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Settling Pattern**: The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
2. **Constraints**: \(k > 1\), \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
3. **Objective**: Determine how many possible values of \(k\) fit the given position \(n\) and number \(x\).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - It calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints `0` because \(k\) cannot satisfy the conditions.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calls `func_1` twice to find potential values of \(k\):
     - First with \(\frac{y - 2}{2}\).
     - Second with \(\frac{n - x}{2}\) if \(n \geq 3x - 2\).
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the count of unique \(k\) values.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It finds all divisors of \(q\) that are \(\geq x - 1\).
   - It includes both the divisor and its quotient if both are \(\geq x - 1\).

#### Validation:
- The key idea is to find \(k\) such that \(n\) fits into the pattern described.
- The condition \(y = n + x\) being even ensures that \(k\) can be an integer.
- The use of divisors in `func_1` helps in finding all possible \(k\) values that fit the pattern.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- For the test case `10 2`:
  - \(y = 10 + 2 = 12\) (even).
  - Calls `func_1(5, 2)` and `func_1(4, 2)`.
  - Combines results and finds valid \(k\) values: `[2, 3, 5, 6]`.

- For the test case `3 1`:
  - \(y = 3 + 1 = 4\) (even).
  - Calls `func_1(1, 1)` and `func_1(1, 1)`.
  - Combines results and finds valid \(k\) value: `[2]`.

- For the test case `76 4`:
  - \(y = 76 + 4 = 80\) (even).
  - Calls `func_1(39, 4)` and `func_1(36, 4)`.
  - Combines results and finds valid \(k\) values: `[4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14]`.

- For the test case `100 99`:
  - \(y = 100 + 99 = 199\) (odd).
  - Prints `0` as no valid \(k\) exists.

- For the test case `1000000000 500000000`:
  - \(y = 1000000000 + 500000000 = 1500000000\) (even).
  - Calls `func_1(749999999, 500000000)` and `func_1(500000000, 500000000)`.
  - Combines results and finds valid \(k\) value: `[500000000]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints appropriately and uses the correct mathematical approach to find all valid \(k\) values.

**Correctness: True**
