Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two elements where the first element `n` is at least 2, and the second element is a binary string of length `n`. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is `i`, and `y` is `i`. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list, `x` remains 0, and `y` remains as initially defined.**
