The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of two binary strings that follow. The variable `a` is an empty list and remains unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the rows of the 2xN grid. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list. `n` is an input integer.**
