Output State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `x - i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `y`, `i`, and `t` remain as per their initial state expressions, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
