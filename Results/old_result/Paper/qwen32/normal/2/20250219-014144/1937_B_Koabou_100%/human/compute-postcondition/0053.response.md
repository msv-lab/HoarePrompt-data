Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`, representing the rows of a 2xN grid. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the configuration of the binary strings. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
