Output State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `x - (i + 1) + 1`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` is calculated as `x - (i + 1) + 1`. The values of `y` and `i` remain as per their initial conditions, with `y` still being less than `x` and `i` having been incremented by 1.
