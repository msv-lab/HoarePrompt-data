Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two elements where the first element `n` is at least 2, and the second element is a binary string of length `n`. If `a[0][2] == '1' and a[1][1] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:2] + a[1][1:]` and `x` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains as it was and `x` remains as it was. `i` is 1. `y` is 1 if `a[0][2] == '0' and a[1][1] == '1'`; otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.**
