The value of `t` is calculated as `x - i + 1`. The initial conditions state that `y` must be less than `x` and `i` is `i + 1`. These conditions remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `t`, which is set to the value of `x - i + 1`.

Output State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `x - i + 1`**.
