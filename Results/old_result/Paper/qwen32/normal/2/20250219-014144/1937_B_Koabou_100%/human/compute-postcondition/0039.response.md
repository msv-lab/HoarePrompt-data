`t` is assigned the value of `x - i + 1`. The values of `y`, `a[1]`, `s`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`y` must be less than `x`; the sublist of `a[1]` from index `i` to `x` is equal to the substring of `s` from index `i + 1` to `x + 1`; `t` is `x - i + 1`.**
