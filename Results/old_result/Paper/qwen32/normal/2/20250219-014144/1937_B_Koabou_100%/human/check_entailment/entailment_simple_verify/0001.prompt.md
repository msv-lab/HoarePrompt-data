You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: 
   - Find the lexicographically smallest binary string achievable by traversing from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (2, n) in a 2xN grid.
   - Count the number of paths that produce this smallest string.

2. **Movement Rules**:
   - The grasshopper can move right or down.
   - The path must start at (1, 1) and end at (2, n).

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - A binary string `s` is lexicographically smaller than another binary string `t` if, at the first differing position, `s` has a '0' and `t` has a '1'.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings representing the grid.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the resulting string.
   - It iterates through the columns from left to right (excluding the last column).
   - It checks for the condition where the current column in the first row is '0' and the next column in the second row is '1'. If found, it updates `y`.
   - It checks for the condition where the current column in the first row is '1' and the next column in the second row is '0'. If found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the part of the first row up to the current column with the part of the second row from the current column onwards, and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such condition is met, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire first row with the last character of the second row.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 1, indicating that at least one path exists.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` and checks if a specific substring condition is met. If so, it updates `t` to the difference between `x` and `i` plus one.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the count `t`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Path Construction Logic**: The logic for constructing the path and counting the number of paths is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios for finding the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that produce it.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the smallest string might involve switching rows multiple times or staying in the same row throughout.
- **Counting Paths**: The logic for counting paths is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the number of ways to construct the smallest string.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the path construction and path counting logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
