Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `s` is defined as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`. This means `s` is the concatenation of the first element of list `a` (which is a string or a character) and the last element of the second element of list `a` (which is also a string or a character).
- `x` is defined as `n - 1`, where `n` is presumably the length of one of the sublists in `a`.
- `y` is defined as the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`. This implies that `y` is an index in the range of the length of the strings in `a[0]` and `a[1]` where these conditions hold true.
- `t` is explicitly set to `1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(t)
```

From the initial state, we know that `t` is explicitly set to `1`. There are no operations or conditions that modify `t` before this print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `t`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
