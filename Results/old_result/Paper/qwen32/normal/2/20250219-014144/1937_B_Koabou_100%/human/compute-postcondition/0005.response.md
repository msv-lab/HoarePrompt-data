The given code snippet appends the next input line to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` initially contains one element, which is the first input line (an integer `n`). After executing the code, `a` will contain two elements: the first element remains the same (`n`), and the second element is the next input line, which is a binary string of length `n`.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second element is a binary string of length `n`; `_` is 1.**
