To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `y`, and `x`. Given the conditions at the end of the previous iteration:

- `y` must be less than `x`
- `i` is `i + 1`

We need to adjust `i` for the next iteration since it's the variable being incremented in the loop. The other variables, `y` and `x`, remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop, which they are not in this case.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
2. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `x`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to its new value at the start of the next iteration. The values of `y` and `x` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`** 

However, to make it clear that `i` is now the incremented value, we can rephrase it as:

State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1** 

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can simply denote it as `i` being incremented:

State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is incremented by 1** 

Or more precisely, if we denote the old value of `i` as `i_old`, then the new value of `i` would be `i_old + 1`. But since we are only concerned with the fact that `i` is incremented, we can write:

State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`**

This matches our initial description but emphasizes the increment:

State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`**
