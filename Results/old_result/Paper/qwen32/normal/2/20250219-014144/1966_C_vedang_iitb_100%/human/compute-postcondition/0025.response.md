The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain the integers provided in the input.

Since the input operation changes the list `a`, we need to reflect this change in the output state. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize`) remain unchanged unless their values depend directly on the new list `a`, which they do not in this specific code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
