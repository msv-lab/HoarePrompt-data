The only variable in the loop head is `sz`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` held the value of the last element processed from the list `a`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, the next value of `sz` will be the next element in the list after the current `sz`.

Given that `sz` was the last processed element, the next value of `sz` should be the subsequent element in the list `a`. Let's denote this next element as `a[index + 1]`, where `index` is the position of the current `sz` in the list `a`.

Since we don't have the exact position of `sz` in the list `a`, we can denote the next element simply as the next element in the iteration order.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`**.

However, since we don't have the specific value of the next element, we can represent it generally as the next element in the iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`**.

If we assume `sz` was `a[index]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `sz` will be `a[index + 1]`. But without knowing the exact index, we can just say it's the next element in the list.

So, the final state would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`**.
