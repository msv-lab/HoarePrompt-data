Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` (specifically, if `sz` was `a[k]` before, now `sz` is `a[k+1]`), `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`**

Natural Language: The value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
