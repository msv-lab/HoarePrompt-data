Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and the current value of `sz` is equal to `mexsize`.**

Explanation: The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
