Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic used in the program does not align with the optimal strategy for this type of game, which involves the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of MEX (Minimum Excludant)**: The program calculates the MEX of the sorted pile sizes, which is not relevant to determining the winner in this game. Instead, the correct approach is to compute the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes.

2. **Winning Strategy**: In this game, the player who faces a position with a Nim-sum of 0 will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, if the Nim-sum is non-zero, the player to move can force a win.

Let's consider a simple counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Explanation:**
- The Nim-sum of the pile sizes `[1, 2, 3]` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`.
- Since the Nim-sum is 0, Alice cannot force a win, and Bob will win if both play optimally.

However, the provided program would likely output "Alice" for this input because it incorrectly uses the MEX value to determine the winner.

To fix the program, you should compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or non-zero.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program computes the Nim-sum and determines the winner correctly based on the rules of the game.
