The code snippet `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. Given that `combined` is initially a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements remaining, after popping an item, the length of `combined` will decrease by one.

Here's the updated state:

- `combined` now has one less element than before.
- `item` holds the last element that was removed from `combined`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k) - 1` elements remaining; `item` is the last element removed from `combined`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
