The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` removes the last element from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. Given that `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order, the element being popped will be the tuple with the smallest bonus.

Let's denote the tuple that was popped from `combined` as `popped_tuple`. This means that `combined` now has one less element, and `heap` now contains this `popped_tuple`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `heap` now includes `popped_tuple`.
- `combined` has one less element than before.
- `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged.
- `test_cases` remains greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`heap` includes `popped_tuple` from `combined`; `combined` has one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.**
