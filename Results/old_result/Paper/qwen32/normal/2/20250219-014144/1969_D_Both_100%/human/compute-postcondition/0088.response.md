Output State: **`combined` is not empty, containing `len(combined) - k` elements left; `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` has been decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `current_profit` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
