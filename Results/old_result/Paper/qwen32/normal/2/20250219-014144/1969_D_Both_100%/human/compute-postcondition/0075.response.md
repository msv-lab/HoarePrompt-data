The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple (which corresponds to the bonus values). This sorting operation does not affect the values of other variables (`heap`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`). 

The `combined` list will now be ordered such that the tuples with the smallest bonus values come first.

Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
