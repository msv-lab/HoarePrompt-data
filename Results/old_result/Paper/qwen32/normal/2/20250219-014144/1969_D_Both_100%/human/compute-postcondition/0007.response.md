The given code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. This means that whatever list `func_2()` returns will now be stored in `bonuses`.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, we only need to update the value of `bonuses` in our output state.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, `current_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
