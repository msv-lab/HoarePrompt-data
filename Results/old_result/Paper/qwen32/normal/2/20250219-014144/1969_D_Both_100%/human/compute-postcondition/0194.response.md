Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes a predefined set of lists and variables including `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. The function calculates and returns the maximum possible profit (`max_profit`) based on the given prices, bonuses, and constraints.**
