The given code snippet modifies the `heap` by pushing `item` onto it and popping the smallest element, which is stored in `removed_item`. This operation ensures that the heap maintains its properties while keeping only the largest `k` elements.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `heap` will now contain `item` instead of `removed_item`.
- `removed_item` will be the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added.

No other variables are directly modified by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`combined` contains at least one element (after removing the last element); `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`; `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing `removed_item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added; `remaining_items` will be an empty list; `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices; `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; and `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
