The code snippet `heap = []` reassigns the `heap` variable to an empty list, effectively clearing any elements it may have contained previously.

Given the initial state, `heap` contained up to `k` elements. After executing the code, `heap` is now an empty list. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **`combined` is an empty list; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n`; `k` is a positive integer; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
