The code snippet creates a list called `combined` by zipping together the `neg_prices` list and the `bonuses` list. This means each element in `combined` will be a tuple consisting of corresponding elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged. The only variable that gets updated is `combined`, which now holds the zipped list of tuples.

Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
