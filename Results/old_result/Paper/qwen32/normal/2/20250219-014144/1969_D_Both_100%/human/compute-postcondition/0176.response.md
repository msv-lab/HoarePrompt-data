The code snippet `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` pushes `item` onto the heap and then pops the smallest element from the heap, assigning it to `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, the heap already contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` list, with `item` having just been pushed and the smallest element popped. This means that `removed_item` will now hold the smallest element from the heap after the push and pop operation.

Here's the updated state:

- `heap` is updated to contain `min(k, len(combined_initial))` elements, including the newly pushed `item`, with the smallest element removed.
- `removed_item` is assigned the smallest element from the heap after the push and pop operation.
- All other variables (`combined`, `item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is updated with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; `removed_item` holds the smallest element from the heap after the operation; `combined` has one less element than it did initially; `item` is the last element that was just removed from `combined`; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
