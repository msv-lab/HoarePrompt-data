The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop will execute as long as the range specified by `k` has not been exhausted. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust the loop counter `_`.

Given that the loop runs for `k` iterations, and assuming we are at the start of the next iteration, the loop counter `_` should reflect the current iteration number. Since the loop counter starts from 0, if we have just completed the `i-th` iteration, the next iteration will be the `(i+1)-th` iteration.

Since we don't know the exact iteration number from the provided state, we can denote the next iteration as `_` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable and we don't track its exact value, we can simply state that `_` is adjusted to the next value in the range.

State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple. If `combined` was non-empty, the last element has been removed and `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list plus the newly pushed element. If `combined` was empty, `heap` remains an empty list. `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`**.
