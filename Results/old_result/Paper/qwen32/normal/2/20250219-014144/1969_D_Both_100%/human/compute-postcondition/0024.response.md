Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from `combined` in the order they were popped; `combined` is not empty (it had fewer than `k` elements initially); `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `current_profit` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
