Output State: **`combined` contains at least one element (after removing the last element); `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`; `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing the smallest element if `removed_item` is truthy; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added; `remaining_items` will be an empty list; `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices; `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`; and `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1. `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.**

In simple terms, the value of `max_profit` has been updated to match the value of `current_profit`. All other variables retain their previous states.
