The code snippet assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `prices`. Since the initial state specifies that `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices for Alice, and the code overwrites this with the result of `func_2()`, we need to consider the new value of `prices` as whatever `func_2()` returns.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet. Here, only `prices` is updated.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses for Bob, `max_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, `current_profit` is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
