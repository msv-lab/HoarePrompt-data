The code snippet removes the last element from the `combined` list using `combined.pop()` and pushes it onto the `heap` using `heapq.heappush(heap, ...)`. This means the `heap` will now contain the tuple that was previously the last element of `combined`, and `combined` will have one less element.

Given the initial state, the `combined` list is non-empty and sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order. After executing the code, `combined` will still be sorted by the second element in ascending order, but it will have one less element. The `heap` will contain one additional element, which is the tuple that was popped from `combined`.

Since the exact elements of `combined` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific tuple that was pushed onto the heap. However, we know that `heap` is now not empty and contains one more element than it did before.

Output State: **`heap` is a list containing one more element (the last element of the previous `combined` list); `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `combined` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order with one less element than before; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.**
