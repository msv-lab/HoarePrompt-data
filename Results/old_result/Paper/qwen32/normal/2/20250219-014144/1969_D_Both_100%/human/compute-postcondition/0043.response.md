The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `combined` is non-empty. If `combined` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` contains one less element than it did initially, and `item` is the last element that was in `combined`. For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to add back an element to `combined`.

State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`. `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was pushed. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`. Specifically, if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`. If `removed_item` is falsy, `current_profit` is calculated as in the original precondition without adjusting for `removed_item`. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` contains at least one element; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**
