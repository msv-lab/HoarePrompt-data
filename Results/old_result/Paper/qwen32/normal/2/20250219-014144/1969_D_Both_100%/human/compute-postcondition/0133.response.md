The code snippet assigns the result of `list(func_2())` to the variable `prices`. This means that `prices` will now hold the list returned by `func_2()`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is unchanged, `bonuses` is unchanged, `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
