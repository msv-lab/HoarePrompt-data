The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. Since `test_cases` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given that `test_cases` is decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment it back to its value before the decrement for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` contains the last `k` items processed, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are unchanged, `prices` is unchanged, `neg_prices` is unchanged, `bonuses` is unchanged, `test_cases` is greater than 0**
