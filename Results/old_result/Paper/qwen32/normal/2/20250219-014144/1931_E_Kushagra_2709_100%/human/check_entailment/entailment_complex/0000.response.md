### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `zerocnts` aligns with the rules and objective of the game described in the problem statement.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Anna's Turn**: She reverses the digits of an element in the list. This operation can potentially increase or decrease the value of the number, but it does not change the total number of digits in the list.
2. **Sasha's Turn**: He concatenates two elements, reducing the total number of elements by one and increasing the total number of digits by the sum of the digits of the two chosen elements minus one (due to concatenation).

The game ends when there is only one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Strategy:
- **Anna's Optimal Play**: She should aim to minimize the final number by reversing digits in a way that could lead to smaller numbers.
- **Sasha's Optimal Play**: He should aim to maximize the final number by concatenating elements in a way that results in the largest possible number.

#### Key Insight:
The key insight here is that the total number of digits in the list after all operations (ignoring the effect of concatenation which increases the digit count) is determined by the initial number of digits in the list minus the number of trailing zeros in the numbers that Anna reverses. This is because reversing a number with trailing zeros effectively removes those zeros.

#### Program Analysis:
- **`zerocnts` Function**: This function correctly counts the trailing zeros in a number, which is used to adjust the total number of digits.
- **`func_1` Function**: This function calculates the total number of digits in the list, subtracts the sum of trailing zeros of every other number (starting from the highest count of trailing zeros), and checks if the result is at least \(m + 1\). This logic is based on the idea that Anna will try to minimize the final number by reversing numbers with the most trailing zeros, and Sasha will concatenate the remaining numbers to maximize the final number.

Given this analysis, the logic seems to correctly model the game dynamics and determine the winner based on the described strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided logic and the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
