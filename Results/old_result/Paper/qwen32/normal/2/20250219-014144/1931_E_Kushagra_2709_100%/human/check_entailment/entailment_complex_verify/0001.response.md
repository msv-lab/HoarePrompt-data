### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided solution. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Trailing Zeros Misinterpretation**:
   - The solution assumes that removing trailing zeros from every other number (starting from the first) is optimal for Sasha. However, reversing a number can remove leading zeros, not necessarily trailing zeros. For example, reversing 100 results in 1, and reversing 1000 results in 1. The solution incorrectly focuses on trailing zeros instead of considering the overall effect of digit reversal.

2. **Concatenation Strategy**:
   - Sasha's strategy involves concatenating numbers in an optimal way to maximize the final number's length. The provided solution does not account for this optimal concatenation strategy. For instance, Sasha might concatenate numbers in a way that maximizes the resulting number's length, which could be different from simply removing trailing zeros.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning. The solution does not simulate the optimal moves for both players. Instead, it makes assumptions about the impact of Anna's and Sasha's moves without considering the full strategic implications.

4. **Total Length Calculation**:
   - The total length calculation in the solution is based on the initial lengths of the numbers minus the trailing zeros of every other number. This approach does not consider the impact of concatenation on the final number's length. Concatenation can significantly increase the length of the resulting number, and the solution does not account for this.

### Conclusion:

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players. It oversimplifies the problem by focusing solely on the removal of trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the winner accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in concluding that the solution is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
