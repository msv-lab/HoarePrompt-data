The code snippet increments the value of `tot` by 1. The values of `num`, `i`, and the condition regarding the character at index `i` in `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, `tot` is 2, and `i` is `len(num) - 2`. If the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
