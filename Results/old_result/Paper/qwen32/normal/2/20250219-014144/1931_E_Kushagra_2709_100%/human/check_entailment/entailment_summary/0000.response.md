### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the rules and objectives of the game described.

#### Game Rules Recap:
1. **Anna's Turn**: Reverses the digits of an integer in the list.
2. **Sasha's Turn**: Concatenates two integers from the list into one and inserts it back.
3. **Game End Condition**: When only one integer remains in the list.
4. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the remaining integer is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Analysis of Provided Functions:

- **`zerocnts(num)`**: This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`. This is useful because reversing a number with trailing zeros might reduce the number of digits, affecting the final length of the concatenated number.

- **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: This function calculates the total number of digits in all numbers in the list (`tot`). It then subtracts the count of trailing zeros from every other number in the list (starting from the highest count of trailing zeros). Finally, it checks if the adjusted total number of digits (`tot`) is at least `m + 1` to decide the winner.

#### Key Points to Consider:
- **Trailing Zeros**: By removing trailing zeros from every other number, the function effectively simulates the concatenation process where trailing zeros are ignored.
- **Total Digits Calculation**: The initial calculation of `tot` considers the maximum possible length of the concatenated number if no digits were removed.
- **Optimal Play**: The strategy assumes that both players play optimally. Given the rules, Sasha's goal is to maximize the length of the final number, while Anna aims to minimize it.

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the function with the first test case:

**Input:**
```
2 2
14 2
```

**Execution:**
- `nums = [14, 2]`
- `tot = len('14') + len('2') = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `cntvals = [zerocnts(14), zerocnts(2)] = [0, 0]` (no trailing zeros)
- Adjusted `tot` after removing trailing zeros from every other number: `tot - cntvals[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`
- Since `tot (3) < m + 1 (3)`, the function returns `'Anna'`.

This matches the expected output, indicating that the function correctly determines the winner based on the provided logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and verification against the example, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic necessary to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules.

**Correctness: True**
