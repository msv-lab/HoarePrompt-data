To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = 0` (since `range(len(l))` starts from 0).
- **Condition**: The loop will iterate over the elements of `l` until `i` reaches the length of `l` or `k` becomes zero.
- **Body**:
  - `ans1.append(l[i])`: Adds the current element `l[i]` to `ans1`.
  - `ans2.append(l[i])`: Adds the current element `l[i]` to `ans2`.
  - `k -= 1`: Decreases `k` by 1.

### Output States After Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**: `ans1` and `ans2` each contain the first element of `l`, and `k` is decreased by 1.
- **After 2 iterations**: `ans1` and `ans2` each contain the first two elements of `l`, and `k` is decreased by 2.
- **After 3 iterations**: `ans1` and `ans2` each contain the first three elements of `l`, and `k` is decreased by 3.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will continue until either `i` reaches the length of `l` or `k` becomes zero.
- If `k` becomes zero before `i` reaches the length of `l`, the loop breaks early.
- If `i` reaches the length of `l` before `k` becomes zero, the loop completes normally.

### Conclusion:
- **If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `l`**: The loop will complete normally, and `ans1` and `ans2` will each contain all elements of `l`. `k` will be reduced by the length of `l`, and `i` will be equal to the length of `l` minus one (`len(l) - 1`).
- **If `k` is less than the length of `l`**: The loop will break when `k` becomes zero, and `ans1` and `ans2` will each contain the first `k` elements of `l`. `k` will be zero, and `i` will be the index of the last element added to `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Final Output State:
Given the conditions above, the final output state can be described as follows:

- If `k >= len(l)`: `ans1` and `ans2` will each contain all elements of `l`, `k` will be `k - len(l)`, and `i` will be `len(l) - 1`.
- If `k < len(l)`: `ans1` and `ans2` will each contain the first `k` elements of `l`, `k` will be `0`, and `i` will be `k - 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact relationship between `k` and the length of `l`, we consider both scenarios:

#### Case 1: `k >= len(l)`
Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` each contain all elements of `l`, `k` is `k - len(l)`, and `i` is `len(l) - 1`.**

#### Case 2: `k < len(l)`
Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` each contain the first `k` elements of `l`, `k` is `0`, and `i` is `k - 1`.**

Without loss of generality, we assume the loop completes normally unless specified otherwise. Thus, the most general and likely scenario is:

Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` each contain all elements of `l`, `k` is `k - len(l)`, and `i` is `len(l) - 1`.**
