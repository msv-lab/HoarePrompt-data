The code snippet `ans2 = []` reassigns `ans2` to be an empty list, overriding its previous state where it contained all elements of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is the second integer from the input; `i` is `len(l) - 1`; `q` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.**
