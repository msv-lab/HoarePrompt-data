The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`, at the start of each new iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2, and `i` would have taken some value within the range `[1, n-2]` (since the loop has just completed an iteration).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `ans2` do not need to be adjusted as per the loop head.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value `x` where `1 <= x < n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration other than it being within the valid range, we can generalize that `i` should simply be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
