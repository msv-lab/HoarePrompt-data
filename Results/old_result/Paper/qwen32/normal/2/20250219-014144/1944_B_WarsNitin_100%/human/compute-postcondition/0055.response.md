The given code snippet simply reassigns the value of `k` to be equal to `req`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the value of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is equal to the original value of `req`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicates from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes zero or the loop ends; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the original value of `k`; `l` is a list containing elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not equal to their next element; `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early.**
