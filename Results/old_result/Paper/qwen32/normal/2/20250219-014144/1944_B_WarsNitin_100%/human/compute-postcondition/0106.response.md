The code snippet assigns the first `n` elements of the list `a` to the new list `b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `ans1` and `ans2` each contain all elements of `l`.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`.
- `q` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.

After executing `b = a[:n]`, the variable `b` will be a new list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.

Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` each contain all elements of `l`; `k` is the second integer from the input; `i` is `len(l) - 1`; `q` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.**
