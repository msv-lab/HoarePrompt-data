The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. This means that the list `ans2` now contains one more element, which is `c[i]`.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is either 0 (which breaks out of a loop) or not equal to 0 with `c[i]` equal to `c[i - 1]`, and `ans2` has already had `c[i]` appended to it. After executing the code snippet, the only change is that `ans2` will have another `c[i]` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is equal to 0, which causes the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `k` is not equal to 0 and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]; `ans2` has had `c[i]` appended to it twice.**
