The code snippet `l.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l` as it now includes the element `b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is either 0 or remains unchanged; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` with no consecutive duplicates (`b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`); `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the elements `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`; `l` is a list that now includes the element `b[i]`.**
