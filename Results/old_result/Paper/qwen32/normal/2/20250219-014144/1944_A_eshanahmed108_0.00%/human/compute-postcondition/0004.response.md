The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state mentions that `t` is decreased by 1 and `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but since `n` and `k` are reassigned, their previous values are no longer relevant.

After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values provided by the user input, split by whitespace. The value of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are the integer values from the input**.
