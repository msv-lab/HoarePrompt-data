To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is decreased by 1. However, this operation does not affect the `print` statement directly because `t` is not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` and `k` are integer values provided as input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator) to decide what to print:
- If the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, it prints `n`.
- Otherwise, it prints `1`.

### Determining the Output:
1. **Condition Check**: Evaluate the condition `n - k <= 1`.
   - If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the condition is true, and the code will print `n`.
   - If `n - k` is greater than 1, the condition is false, and the code will print `1`.

### Final Output:
Based on the condition check, the output will be either `n` or `1`.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are the integer values from the input)**
