You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and friendships is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are the values from the last iteration, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, the number of children (an integer between 2 and 10^5); `m`, the number of pairs of friends (an integer between 0 and the minimum of 10^5 and n*(n-1)/2); `k`, the number of excursions (an integer between 1 and 2*10^5); and `friendships`, a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value (with `a_i` and `b_i` being distinct integers between 1 and n, and `f_i` being an integer between 1 and 10^9). The function returns the final friendship values after all excursions have been considered.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
