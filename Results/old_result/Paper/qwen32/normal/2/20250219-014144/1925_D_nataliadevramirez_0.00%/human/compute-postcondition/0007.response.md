The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

The variables `t`, `friendships`, and `result` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

In simpler terms, `n`, `m`, and `k` now hold the new values read from the input, while the other variables retain their original states.
