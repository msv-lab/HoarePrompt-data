In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which determines the number of iterations.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `t` are provided as part of the state before the loop starts, but only `t` affects whether the loop will execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. `t` must be at least 1**
