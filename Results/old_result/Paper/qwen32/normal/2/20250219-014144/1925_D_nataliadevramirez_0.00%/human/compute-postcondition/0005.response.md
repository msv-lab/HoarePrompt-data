To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and Inputs**:
   - `n`: An integer read from input, representing the number of people.
   - `m`: An integer read from input, representing the number of friendships.
   - `k`: An integer read from input, possibly representing some kind of threshold or limit.
   - `friendships`: A list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers: two integers representing a pair of friends and one integer representing their initial friendship value.
   - `t`: Must be at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `result`: The return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The value of `result` is determined by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we know it depends on the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will output whatever value `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` returns.

Given the lack of specific details about the function `func_1` and the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
