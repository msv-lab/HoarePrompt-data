### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`. If a pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value needs to be computed considering the probability of choosing each pair in each excursion.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
   - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the total sum using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
   - This formula assumes that each pair is chosen exactly `k` times, which is incorrect because the selection is random and each pair has a probability of being chosen.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**: The program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair in each excursion. Instead, it assumes that each pair is chosen `k` times, leading to an incorrect expected value.
   - **Probability Consideration**: The correct approach involves calculating the probability of choosing each pair in one excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), and then computing the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions as \(k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is applied at the end, it is better to apply it during the summation to prevent overflow.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues and concluding that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the reasons outlined in the original assessment. It fails to account for the probability of choosing each pair in each excursion, leading to an incorrect calculation of the expected value.
