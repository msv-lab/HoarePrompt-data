The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not hold any meaningful state that needs to be preserved or adjusted, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` itself.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to have executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, ensuring it remains greater than or equal to 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
