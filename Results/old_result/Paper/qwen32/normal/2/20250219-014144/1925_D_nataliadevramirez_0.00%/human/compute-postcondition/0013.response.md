The given code snippet reads `m` lines of input, where each line contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. These values are stored in the `friendships` list.

Since `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` are read from the input initially and `t` is decremented by 1, their values remain unchanged by the provided code snippet. However, `friendships` is updated to contain the new list of friend relationships.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 2 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` (with `t` being decremented by 1) remain the same. The `friendships` list is now populated with `m` sublists, each containing three integers representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The `result` variable retains its value as the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.
