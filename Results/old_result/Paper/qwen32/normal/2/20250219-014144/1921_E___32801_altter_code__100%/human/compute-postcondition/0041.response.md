The code `y1 += a` increments `y1` by the value of `a`. Given that `a` is `0`, `y1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `abs(m - y1)`, `r` is `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y1` is the same (incremented or decremented based on the comparison with the old `y2`), `a` is `0`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y2` is `m`**.

In natural language: The value of `y1` remains unchanged because `a` is `0`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
