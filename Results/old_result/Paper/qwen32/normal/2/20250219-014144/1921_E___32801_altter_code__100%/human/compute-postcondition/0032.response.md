To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`: This is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`: This list contains height (`h`), width (`w`), and coordinates (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`).
   - `n` is equal to `r[0]`: This is the first element of `r`, which is `h`.
   - `m` is equal to `r[1]`: This is the second element of `r`, which is `w`.
   - `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`: This is calculated based on `x_a` and `a`.
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`: This is calculated based on `x_b` and `a`.
   - `y1` is incremented or decremented based on the comparison with `y2`: Depending on whether `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `y1` is adjusted.
   - `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1 >= y2` else `m - y2`: This depends on the relationship between `y1` and `y2`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`: This is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`: These conditions ensure certain constraints on the values of `x1` and `x2`.

2. **The print statement:**
   - The statement `print('draw')` simply prints the string `'draw'`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement does not depend on the specific values of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `a`, or `b`. It will always print the string `'draw'`.

Thus, the output is:

Output: **draw**
