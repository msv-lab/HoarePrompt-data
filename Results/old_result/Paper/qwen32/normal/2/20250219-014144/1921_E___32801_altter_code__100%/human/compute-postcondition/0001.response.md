Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9; `n` is equal to `r[0]`; `m` is equal to `r[1]`; `x1` is equal to `r[2]`; `y1` is equal to `r[3]`; `x2` is equal to `r[4]`; `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.**

This means that the variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` have been assigned the respective values from the list `r`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
