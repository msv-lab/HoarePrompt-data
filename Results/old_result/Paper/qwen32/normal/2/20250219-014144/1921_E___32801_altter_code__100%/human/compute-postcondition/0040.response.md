Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state.

Initial State:
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`
- `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`
- `y1` is incremented or decremented based on the comparison with `y2`
- `a` is `m - y2` since `y1 < y2`
- `b` is `x2 - x1`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- `x1` is at least 1
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`
- `y2` is greater than `y1`

Code Snippet:
```python
y2 = m
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `y2` is updated to be equal to `m`.

Output State:
- `t` is `abs(m - y1)` (since `y2` was `m - a` and now `y2` is `m`)
- `r` remains `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`
- `n` remains `r[0]`
- `m` remains `r[1]`
- `x1` remains `(x_a + 1) + a`
- `x2` remains `r[4] - a`
- `y1` remains the same (incremented or decremented based on the comparison with the old `y2`)
- `a` remains `m - y2` (which is now `m - m` which equals `0`)
- `b` remains `x2 - x1`
- `x2` remains greater than `x1`
- `x1` remains at least 1
- `x2` remains less than or equal to `n`
- `y2` is now `m`

Output State: **`t` is `abs(m - y1)`, `r` is `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y1` is the same (incremented or decremented based on the comparison with the old `y2`), `a` is `0`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y2` is `m`**
