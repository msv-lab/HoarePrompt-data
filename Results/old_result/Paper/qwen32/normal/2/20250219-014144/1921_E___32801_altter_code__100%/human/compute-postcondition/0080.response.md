Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `t` is `abs(m - y2)`. `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `a` is equal to `m - y1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `c` is equal to `r[5] - 1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `c` is equal to `r[3] - r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y1` is equal to `1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y1` is equal to `m`, and `y2` is equal to `r[5]` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y2` is equal to `r[5] + (m - r[3])`. At least one of the following conditions is false: `b // 2 > a`, `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`, `1 <= y1 <= m`, or `1 <= x1 <= n`.**
