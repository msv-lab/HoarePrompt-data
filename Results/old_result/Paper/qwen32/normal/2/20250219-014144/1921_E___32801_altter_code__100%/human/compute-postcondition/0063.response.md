Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`
- `n` is equal to `r[0]` (which is `h`)
- `m` is equal to `r[1]` (which is `w`)
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`
- `y1` is equal to `r[3]`
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`
- `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is equal to `m - y1`
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`

### Code Execution:
```
x2 -= a
```

This line modifies the value of `x2` by subtracting `a` from it.

### Calculating the New Value of `x2`:
- If `y2 >= y1`, then `a = y1 - 1`. Thus, `x2` becomes `x2 - (y1 - 1)`.
- If `y2 < y1`, then `a = m - y1`. Thus, `x2` becomes `x2 - (m - y1)`.

### Output State:
The only variable that changes is `x2`.

#### Natural Language Explanation:
The value of `x2` is updated by subtracting `a` from it. The value of `a` depends on whether `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1` or not. If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, `a` is `y1 - 1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is equal to `m - y1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`**
