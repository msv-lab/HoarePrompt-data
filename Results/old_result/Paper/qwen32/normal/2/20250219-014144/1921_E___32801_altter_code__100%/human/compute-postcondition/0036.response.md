Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y1` is decremented because `y2 <= y1`, `a` is `y2 - 1` since `y1 >= y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `y2` is 1, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. The condition `y2 <= y1` is true.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `y2` is set to 1. All other variables retain their previously described states and conditions.
