The code snippet `y2 -= a` modifies the value of `y2` by subtracting the value of `a` from it. Given the initial state, `a` is defined as `y1 - 1`, and `y1` is given as `1`. Therefore, `a` is `1 - 1`, which equals `0`. As a result, subtracting `a` from `y2` does not change the value of `y2`.

Thus, the value of `y2` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - 1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `y1` is equal to `1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.**
