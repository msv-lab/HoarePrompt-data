Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is calculated differently based on the condition `zr <= ol`: if `zr <= ol`, `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + i + 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[ol + 1] - suffZero[1] - 2 * preOne[-1]`. `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**
