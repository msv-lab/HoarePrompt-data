To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. The current value of `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 0.
- `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.

Since `ol` is equal to `totalOne` and `zr` is 0, and it is stated that `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, it implies that `totalOne` must be 0. This means there are no '>' characters in `s1`, and thus `pre` and `preOne` would be empty lists, and `suffZero` remains `[0]`.

Given that `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is 0, the function `func_1(suffZero, ol)` would be called with `suffZero` as `[0]` and `ol` as `0`. However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only assume it returns a value based on these inputs.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `func_1([0], 0)` returns `0` (a common default behavior for such functions without additional context).

Thus, `zeroInd` would be calculated as:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1([0], 0)  # Assuming func_1([0], 0) returns 0
zeroInd = 2 * 0
zeroInd = 0
```

Therefore, the variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the given conditions.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1` which is '>', `ol` is 0, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0.**
