To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
```

Here, `func_1` is assumed to be a function that takes two arguments: a list (`preOne`) and an integer (`zr` or `zr + 1`). Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume it returns some value based on these inputs.

Given:
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`.
- `zr` is 0.
- `ol` is greater than `zr`.

Let's denote the return values of `func_1` as follows:
- `func_1(preOne, zr)` returns `value1`.
- `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` returns `value2`.

Thus, `oneInd` will be `value1 + value2`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not known, we can only express `oneInd` in terms of these return values.

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet, which they are not.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. The current value of `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, and `ol` is greater than `zr`; `zeroInd` is 0; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
