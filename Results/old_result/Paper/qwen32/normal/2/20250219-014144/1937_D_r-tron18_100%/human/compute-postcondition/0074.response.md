The given code snippet assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. None of the other variables are modified.

Since `ol` is set to `totalOne` and `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`, the only changes in the output state are the values of `ol` and `zr`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is now `s1[0]`.**
