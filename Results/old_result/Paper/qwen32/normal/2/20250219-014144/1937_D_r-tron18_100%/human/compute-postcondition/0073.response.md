The given code snippet appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. Specifically, it appends the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially `0`, the new value appended to `suffZero` will be `suffZero[-1] + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + 1`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `suffZero` originally contains `[0]` if `el` is '>', or an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is not '>'.
- After executing `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)`, `suffZero` will have an additional element which is `1` more than its last element.

Since `i` is `0`, the new element added to `suffZero` will be `1` more than the current last element of `suffZero`.

Given the initial state, `suffZero` could be `[0]` or `[0, some_value]` depending on the value of `el`. After the operation, `suffZero` will be `[0, 1]` if it was initially `[0]`, or `[0, some_value, some_value + 1]` if it was initially `[0, some_value]`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is now `s1[0]`.**
