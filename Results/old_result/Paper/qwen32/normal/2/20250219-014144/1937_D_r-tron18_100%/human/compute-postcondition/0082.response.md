Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 3 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is not '>'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is determined as specified: if `el` is '>', `ans[0]` is determined based on specific conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; if `el` is not '>', `ans[0]` is determined based on whether `zr <= ol` or `zr > ol` using `zeroInd` and `oneInd` calculations; `el` is the character at index `0` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to the original value of `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `i` is `0`.**
