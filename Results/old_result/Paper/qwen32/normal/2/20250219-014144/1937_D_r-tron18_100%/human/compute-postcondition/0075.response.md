Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the line `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`.

Let's consider both cases for `el`:

### Case 1: `el` is '>'
- `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`
- `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` translates to `zeroInd = 1 + 0` which results in `zeroInd = 1`

### Case 2: `el` is not '>'
- `suffZero` includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`. Since `suffZero` starts with `[0, 1]`, the next element would be `1 + 1 = 2`. So, `suffZero` could be `[0, 1, 2]`.
- `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` translates to `zeroInd = 2 + 1` which results in `zeroInd = 3`

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `el`:

- If `el` is '>', `zeroInd` becomes `1`.
- If `el` is not '>', `zeroInd` becomes `3`.

However, since we don't have the specific value of `el` from the initial state, we'll represent the output state in terms of the possible values.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is now `s1[0]`; `zeroInd` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `3`.**
