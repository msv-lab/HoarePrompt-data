Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated as `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + i + 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise it is `2 * suffZero[ol + 1] - suffZero[1] - 2 * preOne[-1]`. `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is 0 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. `zeroInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>'. `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>'. `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1. `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated differently depending on whether `ol <= zr` or not. If `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is calculated based on whether `zr <= ol` or not. `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'. `i` is `i_end - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 3 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is not '>'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is determined as specified: if `el` is '>', `ans[0]` is determined based on specific conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; if `el` is not '>', `ans[0]` is determined based on whether `zr <= ol` or `zr > ol` using `zeroInd` and `oneInd` calculations; `el` is the character at index `0` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to the original value of `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `i` is `0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
