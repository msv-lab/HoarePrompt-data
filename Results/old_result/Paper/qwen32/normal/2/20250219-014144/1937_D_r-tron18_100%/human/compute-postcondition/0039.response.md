To determine the new output state, we need to focus on the line of code provided and how it affects the variable `oneInd`. The line of code modifies `oneInd` based on the values of `preOne` and the function `func_1`.

Given:
- `oneInd` is initially calculated differently depending on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, `zr`, etc.
- The line of code specifically updates `oneInd` to `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>'.
- `func_1` is a function that presumably calculates something based on the list `preOne` and the integer `1`.

After executing the line of code:
- `oneInd` is updated to `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `oneInd`. However, we know its new form in terms of `preOne` and `func_1`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is `i_end - 1`**.
