The code snippet assigns a value to `ans[i]` based on the given formula. Here's the updated state:

`ans[i]` is now assigned the value `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.

All other variables retain their initial values unless explicitly modified.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`, `fi` is `pre[0]`.**
