Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is determined as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[0]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[0]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `2 * (suffZero[-1] + 1)`; `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`; `el` is the character at index `0` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `i` is `0`.**
