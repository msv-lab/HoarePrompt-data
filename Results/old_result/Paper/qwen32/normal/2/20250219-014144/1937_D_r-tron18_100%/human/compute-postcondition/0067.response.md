To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's analyze the impact of the line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` on the existing variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`.
- `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is now `s1[0]`.
- `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `2 * (suffZero[-1] + 1)`.
- `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.

### Code Execution:
The line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` modifies the value of `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from its current value.

### Output State:
The only variable that changes is `oneInd`. Its new value is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is now `s1[0]`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `2 * (suffZero[-1] + 1)`; `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
