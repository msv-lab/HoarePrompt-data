The given code snippet modifies the value of `oneInd` by subtracting the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from its current value. 

Given that `oneInd` was initially set to `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)`, after executing the line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)`, `oneInd` will be equal to `func_1(preOne, 0)`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. The current value of `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, and `ol` is greater than `zr`; `zeroInd` is 0; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`**.

This means that `oneInd` has been adjusted to only reflect the cumulative sum up to the first occurrence (or the count before the first occurrence) of the indices stored in `preOne`, excluding the contribution from the second argument passed to `func_1`.
