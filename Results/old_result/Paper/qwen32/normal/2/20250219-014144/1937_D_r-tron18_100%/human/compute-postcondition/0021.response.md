Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1` which is '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne` if `ol > zr` or `0` if `ol <= zr`; `zr` is 0; `zeroInd` is 0; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` or `func_1(preOne, 0)` if `ol > zr`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `totalOne` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values.
