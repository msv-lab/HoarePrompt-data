Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a complex approach involving prefix sums and suffix sums, but it does not correctly simulate the behavior of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not accurately account for the inversion of the characters after each move, nor does it properly handle the logic for determining when the pinball leaves the grid.

A correct solution would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position, keeping track of the state of the grid and updating the characters as the pinball moves. This simulation should continue until the pinball leaves the grid, at which point the time taken should be recorded.

Given the complexity and the specific requirements of the problem, the provided code does not meet these criteria and thus is incorrect.
