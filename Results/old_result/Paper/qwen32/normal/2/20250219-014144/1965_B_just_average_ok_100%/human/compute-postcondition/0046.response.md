To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the code step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
   - `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `nums` is a list that contains specific values derived from powers of 2 and the value of `k`.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.

2. **List Construction:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 up to 2^20 (1048576).
   - It also includes `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `2^idx`) is removed from the list.

3. **Determine `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is less than 1, `idx` would be -1, but since `k` is an integer obtained from input, it's reasonable to assume `k` is positive.

4. **Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, there are 21 elements in `nums` (powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20).
   - Three additional elements (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`) are added.
   - One element (`1 << idx`) is removed.
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is `21 + 3 - 1 = 23`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of `nums` will always be 23 regardless of the specific values of `n` and `k` as long as `k` is a valid integer.

Given this analysis, the print statement will output the length of `nums`, which is 23.

Output: **23**
