The code appends a new element to the list `nums`. This new element is calculated as `k - nums[idx]`, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Given the initial state, `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2, and `idx` is already determined based on the value of `k`. The value of `k - nums[idx]` is computed and added to the end of `nums`.

Since `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified by the code snippet, they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.**
