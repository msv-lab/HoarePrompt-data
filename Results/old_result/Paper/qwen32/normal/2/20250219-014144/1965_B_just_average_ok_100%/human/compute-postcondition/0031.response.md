Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is -1; `i` is 0; `nums[i]` is greater than `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement we were inside is broken out of.
