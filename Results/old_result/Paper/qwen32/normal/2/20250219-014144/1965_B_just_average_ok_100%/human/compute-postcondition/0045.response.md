The given code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Here, `1 << idx` represents the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

Given the initial state, `nums` contains a sequence of powers of 2 starting from 1 up to 1048576, along with some additional elements related to `k`. After executing `nums.remove(1 << idx)`, the element corresponding to `1 << idx` will be removed from the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with the element `1 << idx` removed; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such power exists.**
