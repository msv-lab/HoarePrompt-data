The code appends a new element to the list `nums`. This new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Given the initial state, `nums` already contains a series of powers of 2 and specific expressions involving `k` and `idx`. The new element being appended is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Since `idx` is defined as the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists, the value of `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` (or 0 if `idx` is -1).

After appending `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`, the list `nums` will now include this new element.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.**
