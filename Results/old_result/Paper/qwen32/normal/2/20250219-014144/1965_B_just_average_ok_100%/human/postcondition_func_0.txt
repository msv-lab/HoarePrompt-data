The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list starting with the first 21 powers of 2, modifies this list by removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and adds three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. It then outputs the length of the modified list followed by its elements.
