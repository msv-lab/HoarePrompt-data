Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the total number of items and `k` is a specific count related to those items. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `k` is less than `n`, it returns the value of `n - k`; otherwise, it returns `0`.**
