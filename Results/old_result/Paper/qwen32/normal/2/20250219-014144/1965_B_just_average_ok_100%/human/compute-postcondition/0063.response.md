The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `i`, or `idx`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the context, we assume that the `break` statement is intended to terminate a loop or block that is not shown here. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i + 1`, `idx` is the original value of `i`**
