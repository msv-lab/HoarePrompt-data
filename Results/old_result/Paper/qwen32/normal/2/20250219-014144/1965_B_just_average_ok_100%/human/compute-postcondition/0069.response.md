To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the line `nums.remove(1 << idx)` on the given initial state.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this value does not change).
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input (these values do not change).
- `nums` is a list containing specific powers of 2 up to 1048576, followed by `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

The line `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element at the position `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Here, `1 << idx` is equivalent to `2^idx`.

Let's break down the changes:
- The value of `nums` will change because one element is removed.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

The specific element removed is `2^idx`. Therefore, the list `nums` will no longer contain this element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with the element `2^idx` removed; `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, or `-1` if no such index exists.**
