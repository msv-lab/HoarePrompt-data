The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`) and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `s` is an input string provided by the user.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, and it has more than one element.

Despite these details, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
