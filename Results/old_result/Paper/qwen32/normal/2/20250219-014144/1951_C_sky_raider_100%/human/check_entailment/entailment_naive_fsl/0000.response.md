Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the constraint that the number of tickets purchased per day cannot exceed `m`. The program simply takes the minimum of `m` and `k` but does not ensure that the number of tickets purchased on each day does not exceed `m` while also minimizing the total cost. 

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate this:

### Test Case:
```
1
5 2 7
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Expected Output:
The optimal strategy here would be to buy tickets in such a way that the cost is minimized while respecting the constraints. One possible optimal solution could be:
- Buy 2 tickets on day 1 (cost = 2 * 1 = 2), new prices = [3, 4, 5, 6]
- Buy 2 tickets on day 2 (cost = 2 * 3 = 6), new prices = [5, 6, 7, 8]
- Buy 2 tickets on day 3 (cost = 2 * 5 = 10), new prices = [7, 8, 9, 10]
- Buy 1 ticket on day 4 (cost = 1 * 7 = 7), new prices = [8, 9, 10, 11]

Total cost = 2 + 6 + 10 + 7 = 25

### Actual Output from the Program:
The program will buy tickets as follows:
- Buy 2 tickets on day 1 (cost = 2 * 1 = 2), new prices = [3, 4, 5, 6]
- Buy 2 tickets on day 2 (cost = 2 * 3 = 6), new prices = [5, 6, 7, 8]
- Buy 2 tickets on day 3 (cost = 2 * 5 = 10), new prices = [7, 8, 9, 10]
- Buy 1 ticket on day 4 (cost = 1 * 7 = 7), new prices = [8, 9, 10, 11]

However, the program does not guarantee the optimal solution because it does not consider the future prices when making decisions about how many tickets to buy on each day. It simply buys the minimum of `m` and `k` tickets each day without considering the impact on future prices.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not always find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets while respecting the constraints.
