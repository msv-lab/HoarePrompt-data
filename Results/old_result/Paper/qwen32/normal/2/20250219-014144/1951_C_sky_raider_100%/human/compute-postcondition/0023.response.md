To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is the sum of `min(m, k)` over all iterations.
- `c` is the cumulative sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.
- `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations.
- `i` is `n`.

The key variable here is `c`, which is the cumulative sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration. Since the exact values of `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, and the number of iterations are not provided, we can only describe the value of `c` in terms of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. For each iteration, `min(m, k)` is computed.
2. This value is added to `t`.
3. The expression `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` is computed and added to `c`.
4. The value of `k` is reduced by `min(m, k)` for each iteration.
5. The loop runs until `i` reaches `n`.

Given this, the final value of `c` is the sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration from the start until `i` reaches `n`.

Therefore, the output of `print(int(c))` will be the integer value of `c`, which is the cumulative sum described above.

Output: **c (where c is the cumulative sum of min(m, k) * (l[i] + t) for each iteration from the start until i reaches n)**
