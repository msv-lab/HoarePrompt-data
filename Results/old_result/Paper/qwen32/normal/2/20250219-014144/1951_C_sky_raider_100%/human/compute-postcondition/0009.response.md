To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, we need to consider the impact of the operation on the variables.

Given:
- `t` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m`, `k` are integers read from the input
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
- `c` is 0

The code snippet:
```python
c += s * (l[i] + t)
```

Since `t` is 0, the equation simplifies to:
```python
c += s * l[i]
```

This means that the variable `c` will be updated to its current value plus the product of `s` and `l[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is `s * l[i]`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `c` is now equal to `s * l[i]`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `l[i]` is the i-th element of the sorted list `l`. All other variables retain their original values.
