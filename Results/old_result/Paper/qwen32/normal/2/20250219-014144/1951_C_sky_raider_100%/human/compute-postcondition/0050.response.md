The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `c`, `k`, `i`, `n`, `m`, or `s`.

Output State: **`t` is the accumulated sum of `s` over all iterations; `c` is the accumulated cost `sum(s_i * (l[i] + t_i))` for all iterations; `k` is the remaining `k` after all iterations; `i` is 4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)` in the last iteration.**
