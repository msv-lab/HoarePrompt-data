The code snippet `c += s * (l[i] + t)` modifies the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains 0.
- `i` remains 4.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `m` and `k` remain the integers read from the input.
- `l` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- `c` is updated to its original value plus `s * (l[4] + 0)`, which simplifies to `c + s * l[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `c` is `c + s * l[4]`, `k` is the remaining `k` after all iterations, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
