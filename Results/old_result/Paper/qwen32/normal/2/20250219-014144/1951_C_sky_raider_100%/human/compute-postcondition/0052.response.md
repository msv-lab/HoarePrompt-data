The code snippet sets `t` to 0. This means the accumulated sum `t` is reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `c` is the accumulated cost `sum(s_i * (l[i] + t_i))` for all iterations; `k` is the remaining `k` after all iterations; `i` is 4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)` in the last iteration.**
