The code sorts the list `l`. This means that the elements of `l` are rearranged in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
