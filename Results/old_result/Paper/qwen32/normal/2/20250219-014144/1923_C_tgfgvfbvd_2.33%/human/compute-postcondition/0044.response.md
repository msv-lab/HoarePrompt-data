The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already the first integer read from the input, and `m` is initially set to 1. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be updated to the new values read from the input, while the other variables (`t`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input (updated), `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**
