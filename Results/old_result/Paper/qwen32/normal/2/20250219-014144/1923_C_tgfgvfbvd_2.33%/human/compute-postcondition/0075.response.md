Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (not used in the print statement).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input (`m` is specifically the second integer minus 1).
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are two integers read from the input.
- `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` and the cumulative sums in `p`.
- There is a conditional check involving `b - a + 1` and `s`, but this does not affect the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **NO**
