Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the new input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or expressions being evaluated or printed; it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
