Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, `a - 2 >= 0`, meaning the current value of `a` is at least 2.**
