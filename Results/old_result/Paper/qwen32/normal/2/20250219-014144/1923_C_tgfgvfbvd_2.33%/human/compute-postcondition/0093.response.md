The code snippet appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` was initially an empty list. After executing the code, `p` will contain one element, which is the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `p` is a list containing the value of `c`, `c` is `c + x`**.

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` and `m` retain their input values, `l` retains its list of integers, `p` now contains the value of `c`, and `c` remains `c + x`.
