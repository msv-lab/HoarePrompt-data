### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem requirements and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Good Array Definition**: An array `a` is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
   - The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
   - Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
   - Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

2. **Query Processing**: For each query, we need to determine if a given subarray of `c` is "good".

3. **Conditions for "Good" Subarray**:
   - If the subarray has more than one element, it can potentially be "good".
   - The sum of the subarray should be at least twice the number of elements in the subarray to allow for the construction of a valid `b` array.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Input Parsing**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `l`, and the queries themselves.
- **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The code calculates the cumulative sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray.
- **Query Evaluation**: For each query, the code calculates the sum of the subarray using the cumulative sums. It then checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray.

#### Key Points:
- **Condition Check**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is sufficient to construct a valid `b` array where each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `a` and greater than 0. This is because if the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray, we can distribute the sum into a new array `b` with each element being at least 1 and different from the corresponding element in `a`.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles subarrays of length 1 correctly by checking if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 before applying the condition.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
