The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is being iterated over the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the current element being processed from the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be updated to the next element in the list `l`.

Given that `l` must have at least 2 elements and `x` is currently the current element, the next value of `x` should be the subsequent element in the list.

Let's denote the current index of `x` in `l` as `current_index`. Since `x` is the current element, `current_index` would be the index of `x` in `l`. For the next iteration, `x` should be `l[current_index + 1]`.

However, since we don't have the exact index of `x` in `l`, we can infer that if `x` was the previous element, then for the next iteration, `x` will naturally take the next value in the iteration without needing to explicitly change any other variables like `n`, `m`, `t`, or the structure of `l` itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `x` being the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the integers `[0, x]`, `c` is `x`, `x` is the next element in `l`**
