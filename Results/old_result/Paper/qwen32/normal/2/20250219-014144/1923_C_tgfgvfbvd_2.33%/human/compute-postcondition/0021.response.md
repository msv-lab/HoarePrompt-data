Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`. `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input such that `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`. If `a` is at least 2, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
