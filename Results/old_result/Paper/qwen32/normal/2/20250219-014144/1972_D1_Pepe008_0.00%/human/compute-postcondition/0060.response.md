To determine what will be printed by the `print(suma - 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: Incremented by 1 (though this does not directly affect the current calculation).
   - `T`: An integer read from the input, and it must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `info`: A list of substrings from the input line.
   - `a`: The integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `b`: The integer value of `info[1]`.
   - `i`: Initialized to `b + 1`.
   - `suma`: Accumulated sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

2. **Logic for calculating `suma`:**
   - `suma` is computed based on a loop where `x` is added to `suma` if the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true.
   - The loop likely starts with `i = b + 1` and increments `i` until the condition fails.

3. **Final Output Calculation:**
   - The final output is `suma - 1`.

Given the above, the precise value of `suma` depends on the specific values of `a` and `b` from the input. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- Initialize `suma` to 0.
- Start `i` at `b + 1`.
- For each iteration, check if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
- If true, add some value `x` to `suma`.
- Continue incrementing `i` until the condition fails.
- Finally, print `suma - 1`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `suma`. However, we can describe the output based on the given logic.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(suma - 1)` statement will print the value of `suma` minus 1, where `suma` is the accumulated sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, starting with `i = b + 1`.

Output: **suma - 1 (where suma is the accumulated sum of x for all iterations where a - i * (i - 1) > 0, starting with i = b + 1)**
