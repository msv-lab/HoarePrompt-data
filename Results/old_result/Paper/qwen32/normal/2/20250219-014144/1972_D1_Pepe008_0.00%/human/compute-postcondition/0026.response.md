To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Here's the given loop:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the `range(1, b + 1)` must generate at least one value. This means that `b + 1` must be greater than 1, which implies that `b` must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.
- `suma` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `b` because `i` is the loop variable that gets assigned values within the loop.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `b` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0**
