To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `suma` is 0

Code Snippet:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

The code snippet calculates the value of `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Since `i` is not provided, we cannot compute a specific value for `x`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` is calculated using the formula provided, but without a specific value for `i`, `x` remains an expression rather than a concrete value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**
