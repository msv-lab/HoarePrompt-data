To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0
- `i` is the current iteration index

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `b`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`
- `b` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop

The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `suma`, and `x`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
