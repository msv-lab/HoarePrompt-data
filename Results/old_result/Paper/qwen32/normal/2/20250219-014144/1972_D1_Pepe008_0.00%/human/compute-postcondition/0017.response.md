Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `suma` is calculated as `2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`

Code Snippet:
```python
suma += x
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `suma` is updated by adding `x` to it.

Since `x` is already defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, the new value of `suma` will be:
- `suma` = `suma` + `x` = `2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + (a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0
- `suma` = `suma` + `x` = `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + (a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is not greater than 0

Simplifying:
- `suma` = `3 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0
- `suma` = `2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is not greater than 0

Other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `3 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` is `2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
