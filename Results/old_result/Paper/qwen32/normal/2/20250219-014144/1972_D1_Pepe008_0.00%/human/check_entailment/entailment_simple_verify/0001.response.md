### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core issue with the provided program. The problem requires counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This translates to finding the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\) for each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), which is given by \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

The provided code attempts to use a different approach that involves a more complex formula:
```python
suma = 0
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
        suma += x
print(suma - 1)
```
This formula does not align with the correct mathematical approach to solving the problem. Instead, it should simply sum up \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\) for each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

The annotated version of the code confirms that the current implementation does not correctly compute the required sum. The annotations show that `suma` accumulates values based on the flawed formula, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
