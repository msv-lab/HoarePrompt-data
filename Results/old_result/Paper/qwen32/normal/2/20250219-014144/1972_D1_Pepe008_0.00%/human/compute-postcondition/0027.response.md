To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` using the given initial state.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1
- `suma` is 0

The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute a specific value for `x`. However, we can express `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

Expression for `x`:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

Since `i` is not specified, we'll leave `x` in this form.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)**

This means that the value of `x` depends on the value of `i`, which is not provided in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
