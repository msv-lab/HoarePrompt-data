The given code modifies the value of `x` based on the current values of `a`, `i`, and performs integer division and addition operations.

Given the initial state, `x` was previously calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. However, the new assignment to `x` changes its value to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is now `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

Other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`) remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is now `2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, otherwise `suma` remains `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**
