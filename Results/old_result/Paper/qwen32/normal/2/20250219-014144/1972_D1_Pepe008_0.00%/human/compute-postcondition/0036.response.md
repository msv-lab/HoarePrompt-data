Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\)**.

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is calculated using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). All other variables retain their previous values.
