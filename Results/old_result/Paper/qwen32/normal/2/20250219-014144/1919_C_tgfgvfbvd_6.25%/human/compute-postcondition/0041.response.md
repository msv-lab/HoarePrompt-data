Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n-1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than the previous one or 0 if no such element exists. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `b` is updated to `l[x]`, and `l[x]` is less than `a`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not less than `b` or `b` is 0.**
