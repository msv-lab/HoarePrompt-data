Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `l` is a list of integers read from the second line of input; `a` is the first element of the list `l`; `b` is 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been set to 0. All other variables (`n`, `l`, and `a`) retain their initial values.
