To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `y` is any integer
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`
- `x` is `y + 2`
- The code snippet is `b = l[x]`

From the code snippet, `b` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. However, the list `l` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine the exact value of `b` without knowing what `l` contains. We can only express `b` in terms of `l` and `x`.

Since `x` is `y + 2`, the value of `b` will be `l[y + 2]`.

The other variables (`y`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `b` is `l[y + 2]`**.
