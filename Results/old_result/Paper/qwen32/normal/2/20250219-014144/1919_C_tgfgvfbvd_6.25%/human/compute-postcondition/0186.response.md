Postcondition: **`y` is any integer, `n` must be greater than `y + 1`. The element `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`.**
