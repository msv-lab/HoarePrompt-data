Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` based on whether `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` or not, and `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` based on whether `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` or not. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` or `b` is set to `l[x]` based on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]` or not.**
