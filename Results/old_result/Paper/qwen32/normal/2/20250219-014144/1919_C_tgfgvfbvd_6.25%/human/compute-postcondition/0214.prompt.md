Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: 
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is incremented by 1 and either `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `l[y + 2]` is set to `a` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `l[y + 2]` is set to `b`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `l[y + 2]` is set to `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 2]`; otherwise, `l[y + 2]` is set to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `l[y + 3]` is set to `a` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` or if `a >= l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `l[y + 3]` is set to `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
