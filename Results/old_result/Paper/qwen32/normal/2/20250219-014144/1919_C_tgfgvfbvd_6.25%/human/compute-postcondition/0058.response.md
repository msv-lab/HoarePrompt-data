Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is `y + 3`.

Code Snippet:
```python
a = l[x]
```

Here, `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]`. Since `x` is `y + 3`, the value of `a` will be the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged; `x` is `y + 3`; `a` is `l[y + 3]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `a` is now the element at the index `y + 3` in the list `l`, while `n`, `l`, and `y` retain their original values, and `x` remains as `y + 3`.
