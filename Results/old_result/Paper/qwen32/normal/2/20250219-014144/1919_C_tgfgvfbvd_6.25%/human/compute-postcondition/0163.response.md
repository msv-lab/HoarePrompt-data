Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `c` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `y` is 2. If `l[y]` (the third element of `l`) is greater than `l[y - 1]` (the second element of `l`), then `b` is the third element of `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to `b` and the loop or if statement continues.**
