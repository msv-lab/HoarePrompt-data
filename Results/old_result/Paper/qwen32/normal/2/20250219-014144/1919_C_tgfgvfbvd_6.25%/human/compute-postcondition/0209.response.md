Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: `y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`.

Code Snippet:
```python
a = l[x]
```

Here, `a` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Since `x` is `y + 3`, the value of `a` will be the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.

The values of `y`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged except that `a` is now defined.

Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is `l[y + 3]`.**
