Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is `y + 3`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is set to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is set to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.**
