Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n-1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not less than `b` or `b` is 0.**
