Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the value of `l[y]`, `c` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, and the current value of `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing any of the variable values. Thus, all the variables retain their initial values.
