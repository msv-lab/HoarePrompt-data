Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than the previous one or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n-1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.**
