To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `y` is any integer
- `n` is greater than `y + 2`
- `x` is `y + 3`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = l[x]
```

Here, `b` is being assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Since `x` is `y + 3`, the value of `b` will be `l[y + 3]`.

The values of `y`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged by this operation. The only new variable introduced is `b`, which holds the value from the list `l` at the index `y + 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`, `b` is `l[y + 3]`**.
