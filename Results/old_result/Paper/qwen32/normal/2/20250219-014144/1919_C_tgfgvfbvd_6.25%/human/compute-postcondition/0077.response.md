The code snippet provided resets the variable `c` to 0. This means that the count of elements in `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b` at the time they are encountered is reset to zero. The values of `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `0`, `c` is `0`.**
