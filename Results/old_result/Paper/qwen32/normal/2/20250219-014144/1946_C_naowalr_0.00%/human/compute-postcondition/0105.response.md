Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `L` is 1; `R`, `numCuts`, and `z` remain unchanged.**

In simple terms, the variable `L` has been set to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
