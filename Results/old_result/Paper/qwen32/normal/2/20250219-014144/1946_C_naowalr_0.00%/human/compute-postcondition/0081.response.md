The code snippet calculates the midpoint between `L` and `R` and assigns it to `x`. Given that `L` is either 1 or 50001 and `R` is 100001, the new value of `x` will be calculated accordingly.

If `L` is 1:
- `(L + R) // 2` = `(1 + 100001) // 2` = `50001`

If `L` is 50001:
- `(L + R) // 2` = `(50001 + 100001) // 2` = `75001`

Therefore, the value of `x` will be either 50001 or 75001, depending on the initial value of `L`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is either 50001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**
