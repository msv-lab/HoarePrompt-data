The code appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b` in the list `adj`. This means that the list at index `b` in `adj` now includes `a` as an additional element.

Given the initial state, the list at index `b` in `adj` originally contained only `b`. After executing the code, the list at index `b` in `adj` will contain both `b` and `a`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b`, and the list at index `b` contains `b` and `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `a` is the first integer read from the input; `b` is the second integer read from the input.**
