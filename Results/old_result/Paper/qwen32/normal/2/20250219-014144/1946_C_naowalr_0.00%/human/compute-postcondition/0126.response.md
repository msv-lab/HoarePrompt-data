The code snippet provided only reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `z` remains unchanged, `x` is 2, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 3**
This means that `numCuts` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
