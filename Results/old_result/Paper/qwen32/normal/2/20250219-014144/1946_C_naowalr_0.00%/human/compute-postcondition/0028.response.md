Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is 42. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001. Otherwise, `L` remains 1, `R` is set to 50001, and `numCuts` is 1.**
