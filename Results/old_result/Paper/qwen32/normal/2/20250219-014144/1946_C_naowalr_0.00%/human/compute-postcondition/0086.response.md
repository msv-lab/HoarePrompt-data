Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is either 50001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), the program takes the path specified in the if part. Otherwise, it takes the path specified in the else part, which in this case does not alter any of the variables.**
