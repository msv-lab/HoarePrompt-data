The value of `L` is updated to the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `z` remains unchanged, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is set such that `R - L > 1`.**

In natural language: The variable `L` is now equal to the value of `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
