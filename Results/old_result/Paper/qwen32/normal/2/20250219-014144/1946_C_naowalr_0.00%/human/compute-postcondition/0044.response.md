Given the initial state, we have several variables defined:

- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, where each inner list contains vertices directly connected to a particular vertex `a` by an edge.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n.
- `L` is set to 1.
- `R` is set to 2.
- `numCuts` is set to 0.

The Python code snippet provided is:

```python
print(L)
```

From the initial state, we know that `L` is explicitly set to 1. Therefore, the `print(L)` statement will output the value of `L`.

Output: **1**
