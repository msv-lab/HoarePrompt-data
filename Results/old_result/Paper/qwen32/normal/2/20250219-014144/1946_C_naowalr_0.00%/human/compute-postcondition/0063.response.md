The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0. This changes the value of `numCuts` from its initial state to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`.**
