The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list stored at `adj[a]`. This means that the list `adj[a]` will now include `b` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state, `adj[a]` already includes `b` appended to its previous contents, and the same is true for `adj[b]`. However, the code snippet only modifies `adj[a]` by appending `b` again. Since the problem specifies that `adj[a]` includes `b` appended to its previous contents, we can infer that the list `adj[a]` already contains `b` before the code snippet is executed. After executing the code snippet, `adj[a]` will contain `b` one more time.

The other variables (`n`, `b`, `adj[b]`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended to its previous contents (with `b` added once more); `adj[b]` includes `a` appended to its previous contents; `i` is incremented by 1**.
