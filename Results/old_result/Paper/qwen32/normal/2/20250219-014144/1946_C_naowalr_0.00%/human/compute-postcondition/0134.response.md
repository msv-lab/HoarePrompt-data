Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `adj`, `n`, and `k`. `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n. The function returns the resulting structure after removing `k` edges from the tree.**
