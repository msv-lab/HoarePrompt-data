Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= `k` < `n`; `t` is the integer read from the standard input.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `L` is 1; `R` is 2; `numCuts` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `L` and `R` will be two consecutive integers, and the loop will terminate.
- All other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `numCuts`, `z`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `L` and `R` depend on the specific conditions inside the loop (which involve the results of `dfs(1, 1)` and the values of `numCuts` and `leftover`), we can only say that they will be two consecutive integers.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as:

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists; `z` remains unchanged; `L` is `a`; `R` is `a + 1`; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `numCuts` and `leftover` are determined by the last iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
