To determine the new state after executing the given code, we need to focus on the calculation of `x` based on the values of `L` and `R`. The values of `L` and `R` depend on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`.

Given the conditions:
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 1, and `x` is 25001.

Since `numCuts` is initially 0, which is less than `k`, the condition `numCuts > k` is false. Also, since `numCuts` is not equal to `k` (as `numCuts` is 0 and `k` is between 1 and `n-1`), the second part of the condition `numCuts == k and leftover >= x` is also false. Therefore, the `else` part of the condition applies.

Thus, `L` is set to 1, `R` is set to 50001, `numCuts` remains 1, and `x` is initially set to 25001 before the new assignment.

The code then updates `x` to `(L + R) // 2`, which translates to `(1 + 50001) // 2`, resulting in `25001`.

Since `x` was already 25001, its value does not change from this operation. However, the code explicitly recalculates it, so we reflect this in the output state.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 1; `L` is 1; `R` is 50001; `x` is 25001.**
