Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. Additionally, either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, or if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
