The code appends the value `b` to the list at index `a` in the adjacency list `adj`. This means that the list at index `a` now includes `b` as an additional element.

Given the initial state, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` already contains `b`, and the list at index `b` contains `b` and `a`. After executing the code, the list at index `a` will have `b` added again, unless it was already present (which it is according to the initial state).

Since the problem specifies that the list at index `a` initially contains `b`, appending `b` again does not change the list at index `a`. The list at index `b` remains unchanged as well. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain the same except that `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b`, and the list at index `b` contains `b` and `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1**.
