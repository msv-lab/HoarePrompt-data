The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 2; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1.**
