To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit range parameters `1` and `n // k + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration + 1
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop variable `i` and the range parameters `1` and `n // k + 1` are the only ones we can adjust.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken some value within the range `[1, n // k]`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still within the range `[1, n // k]`.

### Adjustment:
- **Increment `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from its previous value.
- **Range Check**: Ensure that the new value of `i` is still within the range `[1, n // k]`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` was some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`. We don't need to adjust `n` or `k` because they are part of the range definition and not modified within the loop.

### Final State:
Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the state as:

State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration + 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring it remains within the range `[1, n // k]`**.

For simplicity and adherence to the given format, we can say:

State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration + 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
