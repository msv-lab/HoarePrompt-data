To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the variables change with each iteration and when the loop terminates.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `cnt > 0` and `l < n + 1`.
- In each iteration:
  - It prints `? l i * v`.
  - Updates `l` to `func_2() + 1`.
  - Decrements `cnt` by 1.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are values from `func_3()` with `n >= k`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is the value from `func_2()` in the last iteration.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.

### Iteration States:
- After 1st iteration: `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `v + 1`.
- After 2nd iteration: `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is the new value from `func_2()` + 1.
- After 3rd iteration: `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is the new value from `func_2()` + 1.

### Final State:
- The loop will terminate when `cnt` reaches 0 or `l` becomes equal to or greater than `n + 1`.
- Since `cnt` starts at `k` and decrements by 1 in each iteration, it will reach 0 after `k` iterations.
- Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `k` times if `l` remains less than `n + 1` throughout these iterations.

### Conclusion:
- After `k` iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- `l` will be the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration plus 1.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration + 1.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs `k` times, reducing `cnt` to 0, and `l` is updated to one more than the value returned by `func_2()` in the final iteration.
