The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the function `func_3()` is not defined in the given context, we can only infer that `n` and `k` will take on whatever values are returned by this function, which are expected to be positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).**
