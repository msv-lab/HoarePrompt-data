The code snippet assigns the value of `func_2()` plus 1 to the variable `l`. Since the initial value of `l` is 1, and `func_2()` returns some value (which we'll denote as `func_2_value`), the new value of `l` will be `func_2_value + 1`. The variables `cnt` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is 1**.
