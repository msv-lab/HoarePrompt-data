To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with the constraints `n >= k` and `n` being at least 0, and `k` being greater than 1.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.
- `cnt` is initialized to `k - 1`.
- `l` is initialized to `v + 1`.

Given this information, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here, the expression inside the `print` function is a formatted string. It contains two placeholders:
1. `{l}`: This will be replaced by the value of `l`, which is `v + 1`.
2. `{i * v}`: This will be replaced by the product of `i` and `v`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, this simplifies to just `v`.

Thus, the output will be:
- The first placeholder `{l}` will be replaced by `v + 1`.
- The second placeholder `{i * v}` will be replaced by `v`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? [v + 1] [v] (where v is the value returned by func_2() in the last iteration)**
