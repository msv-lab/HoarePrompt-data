To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the expression `n // k + 1`.

Here's the given loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n // k + 1)` contains at least one integer. This means `n // k + 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n // k` must be at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least `k` for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`i`**: The loop initializes `i` to 1, so there's no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.
2. **`n` and `k`**: We need to ensure that `n // k >= 1`. This implies that `n` should be at least `k`.

Given that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, we need to ensure that the function returns values such that `n >= k`.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k`, `i` is 1, and `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration**.
