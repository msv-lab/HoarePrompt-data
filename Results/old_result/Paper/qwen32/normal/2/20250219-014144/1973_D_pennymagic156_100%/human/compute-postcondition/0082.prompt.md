Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `i` is `1`, and `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    cnt, l = k, 1
    while cnt and l < n + 1:
        print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
        l = func_2() + 1
        cnt -= 1
    if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
        print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
        func_2()
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration + 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is `0`, `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration before the loop terminates, and either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is `0` if `k` iterations occur, otherwise `cnt` is `k - m` where `m` is the number of iterations before `l` reaches `n + 1`. `l` is `n + 1` if the loop terminates due to `l` reaching `n + 1`, otherwise `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration. `i` is `1`. It is not the case that both `cnt` is `0` and `l` is `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
