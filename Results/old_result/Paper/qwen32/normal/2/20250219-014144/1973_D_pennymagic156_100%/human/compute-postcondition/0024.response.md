To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is truthy (non-zero).
2. `l < n + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. Since `cnt` is initialized to `k` and `k` is a value returned by `func_3()`, we assume `k` is non-zero (truthy) unless specified otherwise. Therefore, `cnt` being truthy should be satisfied.
2. For `l < n + 1` to be true, given that `l` is initially 1, `n + 1` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is a value returned by `func_3()` and `n >= k`, `n` should be at least 0. Therefore, `n + 1` will always be greater than 1 as long as `n` is non-negative.

Since both conditions are likely to be satisfied with the given initial state, no specific adjustments are required to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed. However, to be explicit, we can state that `n` must be at least 0 to ensure `n + 1` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1**
