To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is `initial cnt - 2`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than `func_2()`

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition: `cnt` is truthy**
   - Since `cnt` is `initial cnt - 2`, for `cnt` to be truthy, `initial cnt - 2` must be non-zero. Therefore, `initial cnt` must be at least 2. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cnt` should still be non-zero. This means `initial cnt` should be at least 3 (so that `initial cnt - 2` is 1, which is truthy).

2. **Condition: `l < n + 1`**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `func_2()`, so `n + 1` must be greater than `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`) must be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is already greater than `func_2()`, this condition is generally satisfied as long as `n` remains greater than `func_2()`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure:
- `cnt` is non-zero, which means `initial cnt` should be at least 3.
- `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`) should be less than `n + 1`, which is already satisfied given the current state description.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that `initial cnt` is at least 3 to ensure `cnt` remains non-zero.

State: **`cnt` is `initial cnt - 2` where `initial cnt` is at least 3, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than `func_2()`**
