The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cnt` was initially `k - 2`, after decrementing it becomes `k - 3`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables are preserved.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `k` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.**
