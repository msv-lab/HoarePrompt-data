To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `v + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`. For `cnt` to be truthy, `k` must be greater than 1. If `k` is 1 or less, `cnt` will be 0 or negative, and the loop will not execute.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is `v + 1`. For `l < n + 1` to hold true, `v + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, which simplifies to `v < n`.
   - Since `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, we cannot directly control `v`. However, given that `n` is at least 0 and `n >= k`, we can ensure that `n` is sufficiently large to satisfy this condition.

### Adjustment:
- To ensure that `cnt` is truthy, we need `k > 1`.
- To ensure that `l < n + 1` holds true, we need to ensure that `v < n`. Given that `v` is determined by `func_2()`, we can't change `v` directly, but we can ensure `n` is large enough.

Since the problem specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`cnt` and `l`), and `l` is derived from `v`, the primary adjustment we can make is ensuring `cnt` remains truthy by ensuring `k > 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `v + 1`**
