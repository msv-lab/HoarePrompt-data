The code snippet assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `v`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since the exact values returned by `func_2()` are not specified, we denote the result simply as `v`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is \(n - 1\); `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.
