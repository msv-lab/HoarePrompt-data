Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing at least two elements, specifically the digit `char` appended twice, and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing the current character (`char`), which is not a digit.**
