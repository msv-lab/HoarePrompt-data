The code snippet `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated `results` list will now include an additional `'YES'` string at the end.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (where `t` must be greater than 0) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is 5; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 (and `t` must be greater than 0); `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even, and now includes an additional `'YES'`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `s` is the value of `data[4]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`.**
