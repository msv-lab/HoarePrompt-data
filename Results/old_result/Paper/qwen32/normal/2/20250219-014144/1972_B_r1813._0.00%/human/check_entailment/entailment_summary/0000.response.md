### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem statement, Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob wins if it is even. This is because the game's mechanics ensure that each move flips an even number of coins (except for the edge cases with 1 or 2 coins), thus preserving the parity of the number of facing-up coins until the end of the game.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U' characters in the string for each test case, and checks if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that Alice wins; otherwise, it appends 'NO', indicating that Bob wins. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This approach aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements, as it correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Correctness: **True**
