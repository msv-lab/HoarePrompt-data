The provided code snippet only reads the input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. It does not process or modify any variables or perform any calculations based on the input. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the input being read into the `input` variable.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. `input` holds the entire input as a string.**
