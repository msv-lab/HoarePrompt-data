#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (which is now 0) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: All elements in `results` have been printed. `data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (which is 1) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1` (which is 3); `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing all the results for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and a string indicating their orientations. It determines if the number of coins facing up is odd for each test case and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise 'NO'.
