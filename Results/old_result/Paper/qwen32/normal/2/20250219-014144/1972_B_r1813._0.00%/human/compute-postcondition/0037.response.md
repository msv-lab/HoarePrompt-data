To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (which is 1) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case.
- `index` is `2 * t + 1` (which is 3).
- `t` is 1.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element, e.g., `['YES']`.

The key point here is that the variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, there is a list named `results` which contains at least one element, `['YES']`.

Given that the task is to print `result`, but `result` is not defined, it's likely that there's a typo or misunderstanding in the variable name. If we assume that `result` was intended to be `results[0]` (the first element of the `results` list), then we can proceed with this assumption.

Thus, the `print(result)` statement would actually print the first element of the `results` list, which is `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
