To determine what will be printed, let's break down the code snippet and the initial state:

### Initial State Recap:
- The input file has at least three lines.
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- The second line contains `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.
- The third line exists and is properly formatted.
- `elements` is a list of strings representing the substrings from `line` split by whitespace.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`{*elements}`**: This creates a set from the `elements` list. A set contains unique elements, so this operation removes any duplicate entries from `elements`.

2. **`elements.count(item)`**: For each unique item in the set, this counts how many times it appears in the original `elements` list.

3. **`elements.count(item) // 3`**: This performs integer division of the count of each item by 3. Since each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, the count of any item will be either 0, 1, or 2. Dividing these by 3 using integer division will always result in 0 because 0 // 3 = 0, 1 // 3 = 0, and 2 // 3 = 0.

4. **`sum(...)`**: This sums up the results of the previous operation. Since each term in the sum is 0, the total sum will also be 0.

### Conclusion:
Given that each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, the count of each unique item in `elements` will be 0, 1, or 2. Dividing these counts by 3 using integer division results in 0 for each item. Therefore, the sum of these divisions will be 0.

Output: **0**
