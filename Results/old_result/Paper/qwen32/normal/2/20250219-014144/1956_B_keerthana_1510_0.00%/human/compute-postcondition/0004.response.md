The code snippet `elements = line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings wherever there is whitespace and assigns this list to the variable `elements`. This means that `elements` will now contain the individual elements from `line` as separate string entries.

Since `line` is described as the line at position `k+2` in the input file, and the second line of the input file contains `n` integers, `line` itself is not directly related to these integers unless `k` is specifically 1 (making `line` the second line). However, regardless of the content of `line`, the operation of splitting it into `elements` does not affect the initial conditions about `n` or the nature of the integers on the second line of the input file.

Thus, the only change is to the variable `elements`, which now holds the split components of `line`.

Output State: **The input file has at least three lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second line contains `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and the third line exists and is properly formatted. `elements` is a list of strings representing the substrings from `line` split by whitespace. `line` is the line at position `k+2` in the input file.**
