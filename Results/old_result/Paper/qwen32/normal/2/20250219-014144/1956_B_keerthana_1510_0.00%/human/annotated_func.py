#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of cards each player receives. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        elements = line.split()
        
        print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique element by 3 for each processed line starting from the third line and every second line thereafter.
#Overall this is what the function does:For each test case, the function calculates and prints the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique card by 3. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the cards, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice.
