To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to consider the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not explicitly define the variable `ans`. Therefore, without additional context about the value assigned to `ans`, we cannot determine an explicit value for it.

Given the lack of specific information about `ans`, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans` itself.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value assigned to the variable `ans`)**
