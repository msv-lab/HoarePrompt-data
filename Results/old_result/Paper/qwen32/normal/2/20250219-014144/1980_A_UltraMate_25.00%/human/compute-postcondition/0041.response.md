Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `s` is the string from the input
- `p` is `'ABCDEF'`
- `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`
- If the current value of `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0
- `i` is `'F'`

Code Snippet:
```python
ans += m
```

Impact Analysis:
- The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by `m`.
- Since `ans` was initially set to `m` (if `i` was not in `hmp`), or `ans` was 0 (if `i` was in `hmp`), adding `m` to `ans` will make `ans` equal to `m` (if it was 0) or `2 * m` (if it was `m`).

Since `i` is `'F'`, we need to consider whether `'F'` is in `hmp`:
- If `'F'` is not in `hmp`, `ans` was initially `m`, and now `ans` becomes `2 * m`.
- If `'F'` is in `hmp`, `ans` was initially `0`, and now `ans` becomes `m`.

However, the exact value of `ans` depends on whether `'F'` is in `hmp`. For the sake of providing a specific output state, we will consider both possibilities:

1. If `'F'` is not in `hmp`:
   - `ans` was `m` and becomes `2 * m`.

2. If `'F'` is in `hmp`:
   - `ans` was `0` and becomes `m`.

Given that the exact state of `hmp` is not specified, we cannot definitively say whether `'F'` is in `hmp` or not. However, we can provide the output state considering both scenarios.

For the purpose of this task, we will assume the more general case where `'F'` might or might not be in `hmp`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is `'F'`, `ans` is `m` if `'F'` is in `hmp` or `2 * m` if `'F'` is not in `hmp`**.
