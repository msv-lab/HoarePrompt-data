Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is `next_key`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`.**
