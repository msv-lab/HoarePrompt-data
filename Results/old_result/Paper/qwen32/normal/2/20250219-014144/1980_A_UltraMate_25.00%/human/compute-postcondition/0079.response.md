The given code modifies the value of `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains 1.
- `n` remains the first integer from the new input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the new input.
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `p` remains 'ABCDEF'.
- `hmp` remains a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the non-empty string `s`.
- `ans` is updated to `3 * m + (m - hmp[i])`.

Given that `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, the new value of `ans` is `4 * m - hmp[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the non-empty string `s`, `ans` is `4 * m - hmp[i]`.**
