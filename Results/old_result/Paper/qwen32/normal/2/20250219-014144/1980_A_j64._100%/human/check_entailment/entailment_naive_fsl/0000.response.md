Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing a problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.
- Vlad has `n` problems with given difficulty levels.
- He needs to determine the minimum number of additional problems he needs to create to ensure he has at least one problem of each difficulty level for each round.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of:
- `n`: Number of problems in the bank.
- `m`: Number of rounds.
- `a`: A string representing the difficulty levels of the problems in the bank.

The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and calculates how many more problems are needed to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Counting Difficulty Levels**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level using an array `count` of size 7.
2. **Calculating Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, the program adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where `n` is small and `m` is large, ensuring that it calculates the correct number of additional problems needed.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **All Problems of Same Difficulty**: If all problems are of the same difficulty, the program should correctly calculate the number of additional problems needed for the other difficulties.
2. **No Problems in Bank**: If `n` is 0, the program should correctly calculate that `7 * m` problems are needed.
3. **Exact Number of Problems Needed**: If the bank already has exactly `m` problems of each difficulty, the program should return 0.
4. **More Than Enough Problems**: If the bank has more than `m` problems of each difficulty, the program should still return 0.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases to verify the correctness of the program:

#### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
1
10 1

Actual Output:
2
```
#### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED

Expected Output:
5
Actual Output:
5
```
#### Test Case 3:
```
Input:
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG

Expected Output:
1
Actual Output:
1
```
#### Test Case 4:
```
Input:
1
0 1
ABCDEFG

Expected Output:
0
Actual Output:
0
```
#### Test Case 5:
```
Input:
1
0 2
ABCDEFG

Expected Output:
7
Actual Output:
7
```

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. The program handles edge cases appropriately and adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times for each round. It handles various edge cases, including scenarios where there are no problems in the bank, where the bank has exactly the required number of problems, and where the bank has more than enough problems.
