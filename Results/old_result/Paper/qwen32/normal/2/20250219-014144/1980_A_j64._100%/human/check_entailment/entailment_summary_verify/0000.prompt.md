You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each type of problem (represented by characters 'A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times in the given string `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing a problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.
- Vlad has `n` problems with given difficulty levels.
- He needs to determine the minimum number of additional problems he needs to create to ensure he has at least one problem of each difficulty level for each round.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of:
- `n`: Number of problems in the bank.
- `m`: Number of rounds.
- `a`: A string representing the difficulty levels of the problems in the bank.

The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and calculates how many more problems are needed to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Counting Difficulty Levels**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level using an array `count` of size 7.
2. **Calculating Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, the program adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where `n` is small and `m` is large, ensuring that it calculates the correct number of additional problems needed.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **All Problems of Same Difficulty**: If all problems are of the same difficulty, the program should correctly calculate the number of additional problems needed for the other difficulties.
2. **No Problems in Bank**: If `n` is 0, the program should correctly calculate that `7 * m` problems are needed.
3. **Exact Number of Problems Needed**: If the bank already has exactly `m` problems of each difficulty, the program should return 0.
4. **More Than Enough Problems**: If the bank has more than `m` problems of each difficulty, the program should still return 0.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases to verify the correctness of the program:

#### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED

Expected Output:
2
Actual Output:
2
```
#### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED

Expected Output:
5
Actual Output:
5
```
#### Test Case 3:
```
Input:
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG

Expected Output:
1
Actual Output:
1
```
#### Test Case 4:
```
Input:
1
0 1
ABCDEFG

Expected Output:
0
Actual Output:
0
```
#### Test Case 5:
```
Input:
1
0 2
ABCDEFG

Expected Output:
7
Actual Output:
7
```

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. The program handles edge cases appropriately and adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times for each round. It handles various edge cases, including scenarios where there are no problems in the bank, where the bank has exactly the required number of problems, and where the bank has more than enough problems.
