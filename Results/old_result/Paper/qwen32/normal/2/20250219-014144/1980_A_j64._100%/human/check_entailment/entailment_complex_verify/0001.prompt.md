You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5; a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the sum of (m - count[i]) for all i where count[i] < m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each type of problem (represented by characters 'A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times in the given string `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
- Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds.
- Each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- Vlad has `n` problems with varying difficulty levels.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct all `m` rounds.

### Solution Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It also reads the string `a` which represents the difficulty levels of the existing problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to zero. This list will store the count of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**:
   - The variable `needed_problems` is initialized to zero.
   - The function then iterates over the `count` list. For each difficulty level, if the count of problems is less than `m`, it calculates the difference (`m - count[i]`) and adds this to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function returns `needed_problems`, which is the total number of additional problems required.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = "BGECDCBDED"`
- Count of problems: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` (for 'A' to 'G')
- Since `m = 1`, we need at least one problem of each type. We have none of 'A' and 'F', so `needed_problems = 2`.
- Output: `2`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = "BGECDCBDED"`
- Count of problems: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
- We need at least two problems of each type. We are short by 2 of 'A', 1 of 'B', 1 of 'C', 1 of 'D', 0 of 'E', 1 of 'F', and 1 of 'G'.
- Total additional problems needed: `2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 7 - 2 = 5`
- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = "BBCDEFFGG"`
- Count of problems: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`
- We need at least one problem of each type. We have none of 'A'.
- Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. Therefore, the solution is correct.
