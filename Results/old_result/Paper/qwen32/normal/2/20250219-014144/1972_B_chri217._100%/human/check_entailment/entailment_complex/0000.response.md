### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in `func_2` aligns with the rules and objectives of the game described in the problem statement.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the winner of the game when both players play optimally.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up ("U") coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - Special cases:
     - If only two coins remain, removing one leaves the other unchanged.
     - If only one coin remains, no flips occur.
     - If no facing-up coins remain, the current player loses.
3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") determines the winner.
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice (the first player) can always force a win by playing optimally.
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob (the second player) can always force a win by playing optimally.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function reads the input and stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in the list `cases`.
  - It correctly parses the number of test cases, the number of coins `n`, and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
  - The function returns a list of these tuples, which is used by the main loop to process each test case.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function takes a tuple `(n, s)` as input and counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`.
  - It checks if the count of "U" is odd using the modulo operation (`ups % 2`).
  - If the count is odd, it returns "YES", indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it returns "NO", indicating Bob wins.
  - This logic is consistent with the winning strategy derived from the game analysis.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
