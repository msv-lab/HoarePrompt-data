The given code snippet reads a new line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, assigning the result to the variable `s`. This means the previous value of `s` (which was a string consisting of only "U" and "D") is overwritten by the newly read string.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 99.
- `n` remains the newly read integer from the input.
- `s` is now the newly read string from the input, which consists of only "U" and "D".
- `cases` remains a list containing two tuples, the first being `(n, s)` and the second also being `(n, s)`. Note that the `s` in these tuples is the previous value of `s`, not the newly read one.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being `(n, previous_s)` and the second also being `(n, previous_s)`**.
