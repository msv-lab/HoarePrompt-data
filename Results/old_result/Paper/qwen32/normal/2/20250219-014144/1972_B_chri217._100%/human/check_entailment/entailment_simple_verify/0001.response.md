### Reasoning

Let's break down the problem and verify the logic of the provided program using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Game Mechanics**: Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when no more facing-up coins are available.
- **Winning Condition**: The player who forces the opponent into a position where no facing-up coins remain wins.
- **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning.

#### Key Insight:
- The game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`U`):
  - If the number of `U` coins is odd, Alice (first player) can always win.
  - If the number of `U` coins is even, Bob (second player) can always win.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
   - Collects these details in a list of tuples `cases`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Takes a tuple `(n, s)` representing a test case.
   - Counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
   - Returns 'YES' if the count is odd (indicating Alice wins), otherwise returns 'NO' (indicating Bob wins).

#### Annotations:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Correctly reads and processes input data.
  - Ensures that `t` is within the specified range and each `s` contains only 'U' and 'D'.
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Correctly counts the number of 'U' characters.
  - Returns the correct result based on the parity of the count.

#### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `5`, `UUDUD`
  - Number of 'U': 3 (odd)
  - Expected Output: `YES` (Alice wins)
  - Actual Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `5`, `UDDUD`
  - Number of 'U': 2 (even)
  - Expected Output: `NO` (Bob wins)
  - Actual Output: `NO`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `2`, `UU`
  - Number of 'U': 2 (even)
  - Expected Output: `NO` (Bob wins)
  - Actual Output: `NO`

The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes the input and applies the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The annotations and the analysis of the test cases support the correctness of the program.

**Final:** **True**
