The given code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the previous value of `n` (which was the integer read from the input) is overwritten by the new integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the string read from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.

In simpler terms, the variable `n` has been updated to a new integer value read from the input, while `t`, `s`, and `cases` remain unchanged.
