Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being `(n, s)` and the second also being `(n, s)`**

Explanation: The variable `cases` initially contains one tuple `(n, s)`. After executing `cases.append((n, s))`, another tuple `(n, s)` is added to the list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
