The code reads a new line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `s`. This means the previous value of `s` (which was a string read from the input consisting of only "U" and "D") is replaced by the newly read string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**. 

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated to a new string read from the input, while `t`, `n`, and `cases` remain unchanged.
