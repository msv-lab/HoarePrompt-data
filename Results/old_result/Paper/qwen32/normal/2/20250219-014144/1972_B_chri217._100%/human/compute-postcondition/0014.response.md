Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer read from the input during the last iteration, `s` is the string read from the input during the last iteration consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple being `(n, s)` corresponding to the respective inputs read in each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 1 and 100). The variable `n` holds the value of the integer read in the last iteration, and `s` holds the string read in the last iteration. The list `cases` will contain `t` tuples, where each tuple corresponds to the `n` and `s` values read in each of the `t` iterations.
