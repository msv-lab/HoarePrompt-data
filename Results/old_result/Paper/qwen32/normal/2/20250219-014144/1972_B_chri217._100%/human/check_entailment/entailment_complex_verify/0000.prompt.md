You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- There are `n` coins arranged in a circle, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its two adjacent coins.
- Alice goes first.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
- Determine if Alice wins if both players play optimally.

### Key Points
- The game's outcome depends on the number of facing-up coins (`U`).
- If the number of `U` coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.
- If the number of `U` coins is even, Bob wins because Alice will eventually face a situation where she cannot make a move that leaves Bob with an odd number of `U` coins.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: Reads the input and returns a list of test cases.
2. `func_2`: Determines the winner based on the number of `U` coins in a given test case.

#### Function `func_1`
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, reads the number of coins and the string representing the coins.
- Returns a list of tuples, each containing the number of coins and the string of coins.

#### Function `func_2`
- Counts the number of `U` coins in the string.
- Returns "YES" if the count of `U` coins is odd, indicating Alice wins.
- Returns "NO" if the count of `U` coins is even, indicating Bob wins.

### Verification
The logic in `func_2` is correct based on the problem description. The parity (odd/even nature) of the number of `U` coins determines the winner, and the program correctly implements this logic.

### Edge Cases Considered
- **Single Coin**: If `n = 1`, the result depends on whether the coin is `U` or `D`. If `U`, Alice wins; if `D`, Bob wins.
- **Two Coins**: If `n = 2`, the result depends on the combination of the two coins. If both are `U`, Alice wins; if one is `U` and one is `D`, Alice wins; if both are `D`, Bob wins.
- **General Case**: For larger `n`, the parity of `U` coins determines the winner.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of `U` coins. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem description accurately.
