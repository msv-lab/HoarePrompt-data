The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used) and `t`. Since `_` does not affect the continuation of the loop, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 because the loop condition is `for _ in range(t)`. After each iteration, `t` is implicitly decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to t-1).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being `(n, s)` and the second also being `(n, s)`**
