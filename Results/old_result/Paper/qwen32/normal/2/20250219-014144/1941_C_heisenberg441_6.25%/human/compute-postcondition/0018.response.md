The code modifies the string `s` by removing the first occurrence of the substring `'pie'` from it. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is not part of the provided code snippet, we only consider the changes made to `s`.

Given that `s` must contain at least one more occurrence of `'pie'` before the modification, after the removal of the first occurrence, `s` will still contain at least one occurrence of `'pie'`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `s` contains at least one occurrence of `'pie'` after removing the first occurrence, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
