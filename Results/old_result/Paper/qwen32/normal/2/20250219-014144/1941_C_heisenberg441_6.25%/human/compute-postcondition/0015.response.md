The given code snippet removes the substring `'pie'` from the string `s` by finding its position and concatenating the parts of the string before and after `'pie'`. 

Given that `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`, let's denote the part of the string before `'pie'` as `prefix` and the part after `'pie'` as `suffix`. The code essentially does `s = prefix + suffix`.

Since `t`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `s` loses the substring `'pie'`, the updated state of `s` will be the original `s` without the first occurrence of `'pie'`.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `s` is the original `s` without the first occurrence of `'pie'`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
