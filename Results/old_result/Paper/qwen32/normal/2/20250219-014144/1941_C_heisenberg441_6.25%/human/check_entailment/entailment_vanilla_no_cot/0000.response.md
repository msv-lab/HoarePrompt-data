Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by repeatedly finding and removing occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s` until neither is found. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. 

Consider the following example:
- Input string: `mappppie`
- The program would first find and remove "map", resulting in `ppppie`.
- Then, it would find and remove "pie", resulting in `pppp`.
- Total deletions: 5

However, the optimal solution would be to remove only 2 characters to make the string beautiful, for instance, removing the first 'm' and the last 'e', resulting in `apppi`.

The program fails to consider such optimal solutions where removing overlapping parts of the substrings more efficiently could reduce the total number of deletions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
