Output State: **The program returns the number of 'pie' substrings removed from the string `s`.**

This means that the variable `ans` holds the count of how many times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from the string `s`. Since `s` no longer contains any 'pie' substrings, `ans` represents the total count of these removals.
