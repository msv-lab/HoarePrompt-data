### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

The goal is to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". The program iteratively removes these substrings from the string and counts the number of removals.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - It checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If true, it returns 1. However, this condition is not necessary because the subsequent loops will handle this case correctly. This condition seems redundant and could be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "map" from the string `s`. For each removal, it increments the counter `ans`.
   - It enters another loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" from the string `s`. For each removal, it increments the counter `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the counter `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

3. **Execution States**:
   - Before the function call, the variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are correctly set up according to the problem description.
   - Inside the function, the state of `s` is modified by removing occurrences of "map" and "pie", and the state of `ans` keeps track of the number of removals.
   - After the function call, the program outputs the value of `ans` for each test case.

The program correctly identifies and removes the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s` and counts the number of removals. Since the problem requires the minimum number of deletions, and the program only removes the exact substrings "map" and "pie" without any unnecessary deletions, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
