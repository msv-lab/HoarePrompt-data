Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `s` is a string that contains the substring 'm' (with 'a' and 'p' removed from the first 'map'), `ans` is 2**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged with their initial constraints and values.
