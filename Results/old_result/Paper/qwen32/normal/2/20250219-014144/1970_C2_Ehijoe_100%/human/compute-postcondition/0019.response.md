Postcondition: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, e.g., `{1: []}`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is an empty `deque`. Additionally, the length of the list associated with the key `key` in `nodes` is exactly 1.**
