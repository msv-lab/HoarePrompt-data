To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the line `moves = func_1(nodes, start)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact value or changes it might make to the variables. However, we can infer that `moves` will be assigned the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`.

Given that no other variables are explicitly modified in the provided code snippet, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `moves`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key is a node and the value is a list of adjacent nodes; `start` is the integer read from the input such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the number of nodes in the tree; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is a `deque` containing all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length exactly 1; `moves` is the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`**.
