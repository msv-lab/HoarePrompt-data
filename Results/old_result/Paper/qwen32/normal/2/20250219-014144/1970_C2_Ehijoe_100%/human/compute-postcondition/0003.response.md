The given code snippet reassigns the `nodes` variable to a new `defaultdict` object with `list` as its default factory. This means that any key accessed in `nodes` that does not exist will automatically be initialized with an empty list.

Given the initial state, `nodes` was already a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes. After executing the line `nodes = defaultdict(list)`, `nodes` loses its previous contents and becomes a `defaultdict` object.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**
