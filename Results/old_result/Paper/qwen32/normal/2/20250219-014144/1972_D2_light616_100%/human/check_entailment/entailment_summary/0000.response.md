### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Analysis of Provided Functions:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function appears to be designed to handle a single test case.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` such that `gcd(x, y) = 1` and checks if the conditions involving `n` and `m` are satisfied.
   - Specifically, it checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - If `gcd(x, y) = 1`, it increments the count by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - This seems to be an attempt to count pairs where `gcd(x, y) = 1` and the conditions are met, but the logic might not fully capture all valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the input values `n` and `m`.
   - It handles multiple test cases by looping `t` times.

#### Issues and Considerations:
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be incomplete or incorrect because it only considers pairs where `gcd(x, y) = 1`. However, the problem requires checking all pairs \((a, b)\) and not just those with `gcd(a, b) = 1`.
- The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` must be checked for all pairs, not just those with `gcd(a, b) = 1`.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` needs to be revised to properly check all pairs \((a, b)\) and ensure that the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement.

**Correctness:** **False**
