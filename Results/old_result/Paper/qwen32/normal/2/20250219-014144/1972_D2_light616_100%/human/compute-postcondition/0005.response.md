The only variable in the loop head is `_` (an underscore), which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `_` would have taken on the value of the current iteration count minus one (since it starts from 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and this new value should still be less than `t`.

Given that the loop variable `_` is not actually used within the loop body, we don't need to worry about its value other than ensuring the loop condition is met.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `_` was `k-1` (where `k` is the current iteration number), then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be `k`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can say that `_` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4** (no change needed for `t`), **`_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**. 

Since we don't have the exact previous value of `_`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is the current iteration count starting from 0 and incremented by 1 for each iteration**.

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can simply state that `_` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1**.
