To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact effect on the variables. We can only assume that `func_1()` might modify the state in some way, but without its definition, we cannot specify those changes.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, the best we can do is assume that `func_1()` does not affect `t` unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
