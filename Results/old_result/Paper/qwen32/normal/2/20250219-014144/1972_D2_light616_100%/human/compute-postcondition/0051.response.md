Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 10, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 12.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged. The greatest common divisor of `x` (which is 2) and the new `y` (which is 3) is still 1, as 2 and 3 are coprime.
