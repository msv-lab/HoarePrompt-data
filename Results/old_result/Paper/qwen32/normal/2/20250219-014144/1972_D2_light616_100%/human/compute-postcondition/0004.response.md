To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables or the program state.

Given the lack of definition for `func_1()`, we can only assume that `func_1()` might modify the state in some way, but without specifics, we cannot provide an accurate updated state.

If we assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables or the state, then the output state would remain the same as the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**.
