Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive and sorted in ascending order, and `b`, a list of `q` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function has two cases for its return value: Case_1, if the function executes under certain conditions (not specified in the given output), it returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`. Case_2, if the function executes under different conditions (also not specified in the given output), it simply returns the list `b`.**
