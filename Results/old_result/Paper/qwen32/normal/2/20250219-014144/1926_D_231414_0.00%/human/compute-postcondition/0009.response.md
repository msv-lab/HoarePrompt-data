The variable `s` is assigned the value of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check`. The values of `data`, `i`, and `check` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` must have at least one element; `s` is the result of `i ^ check`; `i` and `check` retain their original values.**
