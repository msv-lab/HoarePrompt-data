Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `data` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `check` is 2147483647, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is `n`. `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The value of `check` is explicitly set to `2 ** 31 - 1`, which equals 2147483647. All other variables remain unchanged.
