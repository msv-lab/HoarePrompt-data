To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(times):`, which means the only variable we can adjust is `times`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't need to be adjusted since it's not used in the loop body (which is omitted).

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes, `times` must be at least 1.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `times` is the integer read from the input.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31.
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `check` is 2147483647.

### Adjusted State:
Since the only variable we can adjust is `times`, we need to ensure `times` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_j`, `check`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `check` is 2147483647**
