Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is `q_end + 2`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 1. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` remains greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
