Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B', with all strings being distinct. The function processes these strings and returns a result for each test case.**
