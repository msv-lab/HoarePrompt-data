Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is `q_end + 1`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; if `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is not 'A', `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. If `i` was 'A', `ac` was initially 1 and is now 2, while `bc` remains 0. If `i` was not 'A', `ac` was initially 0 and is now 1, and `bc` remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
