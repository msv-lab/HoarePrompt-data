The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32;
- `s` is a non-empty string;
- `q` is `q_end + 1`;
- `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, if `i` is not 'A', `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `q` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Since `i` is the current character being processed, the next iteration will process the subsequent character in the string `s`. We don't need to adjust `ac` and `bc` because they are determined by the value of `i` during the loop body execution, not before it starts.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is `q_end + 1`; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`.**
