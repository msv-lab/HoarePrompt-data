Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B' characters. It compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints 'A' if there are more 'A's, otherwise it prints 'B'. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.**
