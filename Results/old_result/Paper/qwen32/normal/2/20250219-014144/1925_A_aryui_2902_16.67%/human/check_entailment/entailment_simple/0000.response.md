### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times.

However, the constructed string does not necessarily contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For example, consider the test case `n=2` and `k=2`. The program would output `'aabb'`, but this string does not contain the subsequence `'ba'`.

To construct a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, we need a De Bruijn sequence or a similar construction method. The current implementation simply repeats the first `k` characters `n` times, which is insufficient.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis above, the provided program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets will be present in the constructed string.

**Correctness: False**
