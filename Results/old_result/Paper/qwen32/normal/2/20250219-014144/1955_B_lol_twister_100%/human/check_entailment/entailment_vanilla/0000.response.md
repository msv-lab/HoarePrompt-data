Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to determine the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to construct a progressive square of size \( n \times n \) using the rules:
  - The top-left element is \( a_{1,1} \).
  - Each element in the \( i \)-th row and \( j \)-th column is calculated as \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

- Given \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and a list of \( n^2 \) integers, we need to determine if the list can be rearranged to form such a progressive square.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and the list of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Finding \( a_{1,1} \)**:
   - The program finds the minimum value in the list \( l \) and assigns it to \( a \). This is a reasonable assumption because \( a_{1,1} \) should be the smallest element in the progressive square.

3. **Generating Progressive Square**:
   - The program generates the expected elements of the progressive square using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).
   - It stores these elements in a list \( li \).

4. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - Both the generated list \( li \) and the input list \( l \) are sorted.
   - If they match, it means the input list can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the program returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Finding \( a_{1,1} \)**:
  - The assumption that the minimum value in the list is \( a_{1,1} \) is correct because \( a_{1,1} \) is the smallest element in the progressive square.

- **Generating Progressive Square**:
  - The nested loops correctly generate the elements of the progressive square based on the given formula.

- **Sorting and Comparison**:
  - Sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the input list can be rearranged to match the progressive square, regardless of the initial order of elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list can be rearranged to form the progressive square based on the provided rules.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
