Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a sorted list containing n^2 elements `[a + 0 * c + 0 * d, a + 0 * c + 1 * d, ..., a + 0 * c + (n-1) * d, a + 1 * c + 0 * d, a + 1 * c + 1 * d, ..., a + 1 * c + (n-1) * d, ..., a + (n-1) * c + 0 * d, a + (n-1) * c + 1 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * c + (n-1) * d]`. The list `l` is equal to the list `li`.**
