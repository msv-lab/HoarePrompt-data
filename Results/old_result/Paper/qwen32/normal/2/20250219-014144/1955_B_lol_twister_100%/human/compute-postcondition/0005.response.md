The only variable in the loop head is `h`. According to the loop statement, `h` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `h` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`

At the end of the previous iteration, `h` was some value (let's call it `h_prev`). Since the loop increments `h` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `h` should be `h_prev + 1`.

Therefore, if `h` was `h_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `h` will be `h_prev + 1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `h_prev`, we can denote the new value of `h` as `h_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is `h_prev + 1`** 

However, since we need to provide a concrete state and `h_prev` is not specified, we can assume `h_prev` was the last value before the current iteration, which would mean if the loop just finished iterating over `h = h_prev`, the next value should be `h = h_prev + 1`. If we consider the loop started from `h = 0`, and the previous iteration ended with `h = h_prev`, then the next iteration starts with `h = h_prev + 1`. For simplicity, if we assume the previous iteration ended with `h = 0`, the next iteration would start with `h = 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a + k * c + d * h`, `h` is 1**
