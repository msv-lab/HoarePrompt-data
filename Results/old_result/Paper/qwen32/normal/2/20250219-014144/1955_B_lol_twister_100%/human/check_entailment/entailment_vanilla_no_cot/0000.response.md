To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Progressive Square Construction:**
   - The matrix is constructed using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\).
   - Given \(a_{1,1}\), \(c\), and \(d\), we need to generate the entire \(n \times n\) matrix.
   - Since \(a_{1,1}\) is not directly provided but can be inferred as the minimum value in the array, we assume \(a_{1,1} = \min(l)\).

2. **Verification:**
   - Generate the progressive square using the inferred \(a_{1,1}\) and the given \(c\) and \(d\).
   - Sort both the generated square and the provided array.
   - Compare the sorted arrays to check if they match.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\), followed by the array \(l\) of \(n^2\) integers.

2. **Matrix Generation:**
   - The function `func_1` infers \(a_{1,1}\) as the minimum value in the array.
   - It then generates the expected matrix values using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\).
   - These values are stored in the list `li`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both `li` and the input array `l` are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly infers \(a_{1,1}\) as the minimum value in the array.
- It accurately generates the progressive square using the provided \(c\) and \(d\).
- The sorting and comparison steps ensure that the program correctly verifies if the provided array can form the progressive square.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
