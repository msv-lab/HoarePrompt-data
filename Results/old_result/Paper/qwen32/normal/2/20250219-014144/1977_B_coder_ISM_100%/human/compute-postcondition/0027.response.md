The code changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where the element at index `i` is '-1', and all other elements are '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is 0, `i` is 0, `s[i + 1]` is '1'.**
