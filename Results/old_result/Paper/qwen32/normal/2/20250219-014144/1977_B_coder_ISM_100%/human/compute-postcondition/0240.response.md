The code changes the character at index `i - 1` of the string `s` to `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 3, the character at index `2` of `s` is changed to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`length` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `s` has its character at index 3 changed to `'0'` and its character at index 2 changed to `'-1'`.**

This means that the string `s` now has `'-1'` at index 2 and `'0'` at index 3, while the values of `length` and `i` remain unchanged.
