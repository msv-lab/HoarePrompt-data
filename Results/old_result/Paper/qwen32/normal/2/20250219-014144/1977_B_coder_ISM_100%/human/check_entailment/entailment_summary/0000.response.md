### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided Python program and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary-like string `s` of length 30 where each element represents whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set (`'1'`) or not (`'0'`). This is done using bitwise operations.

3. **Transformation Rules:**
   - The program applies several rules to transform the binary-like string `s`:
     - If two consecutive `'1'`s are found, it replaces the first `'1'` with `'-1'` and sets a flag to indicate that the next `'0'` should be turned into a `'1'`.
     - If a `'0'` is encountered after setting the flag, it turns that `'0'` into a `'1'` and resets the flag.
     - If the flag is still set at the end of the string and the last element is `'0'`, it turns that `'0'` into a `'1'`.
     - If the flag is still set at the end of the string and the last element is not `'0'`, it appends an additional `'1'` to the string, effectively increasing its length by 1.
     - Finally, it checks for any occurrence of `'-1'` followed by `'1'` and swaps them to ensure no two non-zero elements are adjacent.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the transformed string and the transformed string itself.

### Verification Against Requirements:
- **Length Constraint:** The maximum length of the transformed string is 32, which satisfies the requirement `1 \le n \le 32`.
- **Element Constraints:** The elements of the array are either `1`, `0`, or `-1`, satisfying the requirement `a_i` is `1`, `0`, or `-1` for all `0 \le i \le n - 1`.
- **Sum Condition:** The transformations ensure that the sum of the array elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals the original number `x`.
- **No Adjacent Non-Zero Elements:** The transformations prevent any two non-zero elements from being adjacent, satisfying the requirement that there does not exist an index `0 \le i \le n - 2` such that both `a_i \neq 0` and `a_{i + 1} \neq 0`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
