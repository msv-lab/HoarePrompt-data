Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Binary Conversion**: The program converts the integer `x` into its binary representation but does not handle the requirement that no two consecutive elements in the array can be non-zero.

2. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**: The program attempts to handle consecutive non-zero elements but does so incorrectly. Specifically, it tries to flip values and add new elements to the array, but these changes do not guarantee that the resulting array will meet the problem's requirements.

3. **Appending Elements**: The program appends elements to the array without properly adjusting the length variable `length`. This can lead to incorrect outputs where the length does not match the actual number of elements in the array.

4. **Final Adjustments**: The final adjustments made to the array (swapping `-1` and `1`) are not guaranteed to produce a valid solution that meets the problem's constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        i = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                s.append(1)
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x //= 2
            i += 1
        
        # Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        i = 0
        while i < len(s) - 1:
            if s[i] != 0 and s[i + 1] != 0:
                s[i] = -1
                s.insert(i + 1, 0)
            i += 1
        
        # If the last element is -1, we need to adjust
        if s[-1] == -1:
            s.pop()
            s.append(0)
            s.append(1)
        
        print(len(s))
        print(*s)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that no two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero and constructs the array correctly according to the problem's requirements.
