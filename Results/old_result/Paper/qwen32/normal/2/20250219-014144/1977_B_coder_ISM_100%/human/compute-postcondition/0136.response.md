Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`, and `i` is `i + 1` where 0 ≤ `i` < 28. If `flag` was true and the `i`-th character of `s` was `'0'`, then the `i`-th character of `s` is set to `'1'` and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 0 or the `i`-th character of `s` is not equal to the `(i+1)`-th character or either of them is not `'1'`, then no changes are made to `s` or `flag`.**
