The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` at index `i` (which is 1) by setting its value to `'-1'`. 

Given the initial state, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the bits of `x`. Since `i` is 1, `s[1]` will now be `'-1'`.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `nalla`, `length`, `flag`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where `s[1]` is '-1' and other elements are '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is 0, `i` is 1.**
