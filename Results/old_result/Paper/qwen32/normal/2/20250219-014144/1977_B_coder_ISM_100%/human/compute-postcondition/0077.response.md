The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to `'-1'`. This affects the list `s` but does not change the values of other variables like `t`, `x`, `nalla`, `length`, `flag`, or `i`.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the list `s` where the element at position `i - 1` is now `'-1'`.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is '0', or `length` is 31 if `flag` is not 0, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with '-1' replacing the first of any consecutive '1's and '0' replacing the second of those consecutive '1's, except `s[29]` which is '1' if `flag` is not 0, and the 31st element is '1' if `flag` is not 0, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0', `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `s[i]` is '0', `s[i - 1]` is '-1'**.

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` is now `'-1'`.
