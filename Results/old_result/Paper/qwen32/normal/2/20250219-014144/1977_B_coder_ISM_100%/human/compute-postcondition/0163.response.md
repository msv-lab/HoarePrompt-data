Given the initial state, the list `s` has undergone a transformation where every occurrence of the substring `'1'` immediately followed by `'-1'` has been replaced with `'0'` followed by `'-1'`. The variable `length` is mentioned but does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.

Let's break down the transformation:
- If the original list `s` contained any sequence like `['1', '-1']`, it would have been transformed to `['0', '-1']`.

However, the exact content of the list `s` before this transformation is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the output based on the transformation rule applied.

The `print(*s)` statement will unpack the list `s` and print each element separated by spaces.

Since the transformation rule is clear, the output will be the elements of the transformed list `s`, with each element being either a number, a `'0'`, or a `'-1'`.

Output: **the elements of the transformed list `s`, where all occurrences of `'1'` followed by `'-1'` have been replaced with `'0'` followed by `'-1'`**
