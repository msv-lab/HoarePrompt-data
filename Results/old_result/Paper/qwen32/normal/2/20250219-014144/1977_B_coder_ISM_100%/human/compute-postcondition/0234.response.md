The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `length`. If `i` is less than `length`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented from its previous value, and `length` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `length` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`. Since `i_end` was less than `length` at the end of the previous iteration, `length` must still be greater than `i_end + 1`.

Given that `i_end` was 1 at the end of the first iteration (since the loop starts from 1), let's assume `i_end` is now some value `k` where `k < length`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`, and `length` must be greater than `k + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` but we know it must be less than `length`, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1, and `length` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`length` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To make it more concrete, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2, and `length` must be greater than 2.

State: **`length` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**. 

However, since we need a general form without assuming specific values:

State: **`length` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

For clarity in the context of the problem, let's assume the most immediate next step after `i = 1`:

State: **`length` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**.
