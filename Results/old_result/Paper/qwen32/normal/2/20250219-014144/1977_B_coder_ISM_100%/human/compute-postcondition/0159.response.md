The code changes the value of `s[i - 1]` to `'-1'`. All other variables retain their previous values. Since `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `s[i]` is `'0'`, the only change is in the element at index `i-1` of the list `s`.

Output State: **`length` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s[i]` is `'0'`, `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`**.
