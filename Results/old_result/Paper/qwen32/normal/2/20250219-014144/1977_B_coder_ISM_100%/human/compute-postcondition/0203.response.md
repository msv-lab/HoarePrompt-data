The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` modifies the element at index `i` of the list `s` to `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of the list `s` is set to `'-1'`.

Here's the updated state:

- `s[1]` is now `'-1'`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`, except `s[0]` which could be `'-1'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was initially `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`. Now, `s[1]` is `'-1'`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[1]` is now `'1'` and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 1.**
