Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`, except possibly `s[0]` which could be `'-1'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was initially `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 0. If `flag` was 0, no changes occur to `s`, `flag`, or `i`. If `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`, then `s[0]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and no changes occur to `s` or `i`.**
