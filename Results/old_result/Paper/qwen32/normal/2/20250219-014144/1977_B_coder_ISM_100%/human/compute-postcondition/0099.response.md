Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. `s` is modified based on the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` with an additional '1' appended if the condition is true, otherwise an additional '0' is appended to `s`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
