Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now `'1'` and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains unchanged, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` and both were '1', then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. `i` is `i + 1` where 0 ≤ `i` < 28.**
