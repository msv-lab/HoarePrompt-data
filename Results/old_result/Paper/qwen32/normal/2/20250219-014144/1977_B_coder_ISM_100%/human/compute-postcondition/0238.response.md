The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `length`. If `i` is less than `length`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `length` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `length` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`length` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
