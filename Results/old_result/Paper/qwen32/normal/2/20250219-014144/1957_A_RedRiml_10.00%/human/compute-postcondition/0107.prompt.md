Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 0, `w` is decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` is already in `pl`, `pl` and `d` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, and `pl` remains unchanged unless `i` is not in `pl`, in which case `i` is appended to `pl`. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now has `i` mapped to `1`; otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element and `d[i]` is now 1; otherwise, `d[i]` is now `d[i] + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
