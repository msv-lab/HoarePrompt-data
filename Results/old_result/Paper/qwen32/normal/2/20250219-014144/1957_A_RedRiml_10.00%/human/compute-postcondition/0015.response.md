To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `palka`, so we need to consider how `palka` and the loop variable `i` should be adjusted.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.
- `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer.
- `pl` is a list that may contain `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl`.
- `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

Loop statement:
```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` held the value of the last element processed from `palka`. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to take the value of the next element in `palka`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `palka` as `current_index`. After the previous iteration, `current_index` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to `palka[current_index]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `current_index` from the previous state, we can infer that `i` should be the next element in `palka` following its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may contain `i` as its last element if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` following its previous value.**
