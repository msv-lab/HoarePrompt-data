The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is overwritten to `1`. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value `1`.

Here's the updated output state considering the changes made by the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` now contains the previously processed `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.**

In natural language: The value of `d[i]` is set to `1`, overwriting any previous value it might have had. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
