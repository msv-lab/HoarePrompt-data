You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of unique integers that appear at least three times in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks.
- Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick can be used in more than one polygon.
- Regular polygons require at least 3 sides.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It iterates through the list of stick lengths, updating the count in the dictionary `d`.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` of unique stick lengths, although this could be simplified by using the keys of the dictionary directly.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - It initializes a counter `shapes` to zero.
   - It iterates through the unique stick lengths stored in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`if d[j] >= 3`).
   - If there are, it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, it prints the value of `shapes`, which represents the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the sticks of that test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The current implementation does not account for forming polygons with more than 3 sides. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, it should be possible to form two triangles, but the program only counts one polygon.
- The program assumes that each set of 3 sticks of the same length forms exactly one polygon, without considering larger polygons that might be possible.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) that can be formed with the available sticks. This involves checking for multiples of 3, 4, 5, etc., up to the number of sticks available for each length.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program is **incorrect** because it does not account for forming multiple smaller polygons with the same stick lengths.

Correctness: **False**
