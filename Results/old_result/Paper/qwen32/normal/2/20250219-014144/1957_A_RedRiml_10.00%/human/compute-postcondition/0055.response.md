The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `palka`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes and what implications this has for the loop continuing to execute.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.
- `w` is `w - 1`.
- `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned).
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer.
- `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i` (it contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` before the if statement).
- `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`.
- `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the last element in `palka` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `palka` to process. Therefore, `i` should now take the value of the next element in `palka`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. The next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be the next element in `palka` after `i_prev`. Since we don't know the exact position of `i_prev` in `palka`, we can assume that `i` is the next element in the sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i` (it contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` before the if statement); `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element**.
