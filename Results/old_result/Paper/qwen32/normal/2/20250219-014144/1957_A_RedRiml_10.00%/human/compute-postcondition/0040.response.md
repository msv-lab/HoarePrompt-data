To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: An integer representing the number of integers in the list (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
     - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`: A list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
     - `w`: An integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
     - `ln`: An integer.
     - `palka`: A list of integers read from the input.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `pl`: A list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
   - `d`: A dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
   - `shapes`: The count of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

Given this setup, the `shapes` variable is specifically counting how many unique numbers in the `palka` list appear at least 3 times.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, there is a list `palka` of integers.

2. **Creating `pl` and `d`:**
   - `pl` is created by iterating through `palka` and adding each unique element to `pl` in the order they first appear.
   - `d` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each element in `palka`.

3. **Calculating `shapes`:**
   - `shapes` is initialized to 0.
   - For each unique element in `pl`, if the count of that element in `d` is at least 3, increment `shapes` by 1.

### Final Output:

The `print(shapes)` statement will output the number of unique elements in the `palka` list that appear at least 3 times.

Since the specific values of `palka` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `shapes`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the count of unique elements in the `palka` list that appear at least 3 times)**
