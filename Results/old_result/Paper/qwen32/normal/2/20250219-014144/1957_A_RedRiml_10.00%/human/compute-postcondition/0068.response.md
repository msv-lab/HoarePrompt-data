Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appear; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and its value is the count of that element in `palka`; `shapes` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `shapes` is set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
