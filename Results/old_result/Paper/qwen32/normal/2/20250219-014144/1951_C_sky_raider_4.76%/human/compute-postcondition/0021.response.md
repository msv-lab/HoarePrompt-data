The given code snippet assigns new values to `n`, `m`, and `k` by reading them from user input. The variables `l`, `k` (reduced by the sum of all `s` values), `c`, and `i` remain unchanged in terms of their previous definitions unless explicitly modified by subsequent code.

Given the input operation, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now set to whatever integers the user provides. The other variables (`l`, `k` as per its reduction, `c`, and `i`) retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are set to the integers provided by the user input; `l` unchanged; `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations; `c` is updated to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[i] * s_i - s_i * s_i / 2 for i in range(n)); `i` is incremented by 1.**
