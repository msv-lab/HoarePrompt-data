The value of `k` is decreased by `s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged. The new value of `k` is `k - s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is set according to user input, `k` is `k - s`, `l` is set according to user input, `c` is set according to user input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
