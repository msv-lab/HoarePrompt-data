The given code snippet updates the value of `c` to `k * k / 2`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are set to the integers provided by the user input; `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input; `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations; `c` is updated to `k * k / 2`; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` is 0.**
