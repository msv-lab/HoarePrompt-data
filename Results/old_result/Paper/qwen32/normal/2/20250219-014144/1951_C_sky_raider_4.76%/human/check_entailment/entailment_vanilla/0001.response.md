Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, given that:
- Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on a particular day increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices `l`.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list of prices `l`. This is a good start because buying cheaper tickets first generally minimizes the cost.
3. **Initialization**: It initializes `s` (which seems intended to represent the number of tickets bought on a given day) to 0 and `c` (the total cost) to `k * k / 2`. The initialization of `c` to `k * k / 2` is suspicious and doesn't align with the problem's requirements.
4. **Loop Through Days**: For each day, it calculates the number of tickets `s` to buy as the minimum of `m` and `k` (remaining tickets to buy). It then subtracts `s` from `k` and adds the cost of these tickets to `c`. The cost calculation includes a term `-s * s / 2`, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total cost `c`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Initialization of `c`**: The initial value of `c` is set to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. The cost should start at 0.
- **Cost Calculation**: The term `-s * s / 2` in the cost calculation is incorrect. The cost should simply be the price of the tickets multiplied by the number of tickets bought, without any subtraction.
- **Price Adjustment**: The program does not adjust the prices for subsequent days after buying tickets, which is a crucial part of the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the list of prices.
2. Iterate through the sorted list, buying up to `m` tickets each day until we've bought `k` tickets.
3. Adjust the prices for subsequent days after each purchase.
4. Accumulate the total cost.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
