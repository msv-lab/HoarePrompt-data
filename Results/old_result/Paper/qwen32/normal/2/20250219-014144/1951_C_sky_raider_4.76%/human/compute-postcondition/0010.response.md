The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's denote it as `i_end`), and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i_end + 1`. The condition `n > 0` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_end + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`**

However, since we don't know the specific value of `i_end`, we can simply say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
