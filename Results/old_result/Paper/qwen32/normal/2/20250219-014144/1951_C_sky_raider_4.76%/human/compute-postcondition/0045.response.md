The code snippet provided updates the value of `c` by assigning it the value of `k * k / 2`. This calculation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `s`, or `l`. The value of `k` remains unchanged, but its effect on `c` is now specified.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values read from the input; `i` is `n + 1`; `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations; `c` is `k * k / 2`; `s` is 0; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
