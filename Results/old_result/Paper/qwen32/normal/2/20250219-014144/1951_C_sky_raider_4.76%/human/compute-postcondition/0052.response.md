The code snippet `k -= s` reduces the value of `k` by the value of `s`. Given the initial state, `k` was already defined as `k - s`, and now it is further reduced by `s`. This means `k` is effectively reduced by `2 * s`.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `k` is initially `k - s` and then becomes `(k - s) - s`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * s`.
- `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2` and remains unchanged by this operation.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k - s`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - s`.**
