The given code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `c`, or `s` directly. The only change is the introduction of the new list `l`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values read from the input; `i` is `n + 1`; `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations; `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` in the last iteration; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
