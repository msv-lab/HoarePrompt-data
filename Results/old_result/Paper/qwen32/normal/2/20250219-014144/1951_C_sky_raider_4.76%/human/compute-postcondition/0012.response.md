The value of `k` is decremented by `s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is incremented by 1 still holds.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`.**
