In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range specified by the input value, which is the number of test cases. The loop variable `i` will iterate from 0 up to (but not including) the number of test cases.

Given the for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is determined by the integer value read from the input. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value is greater than 0. This will ensure that the range function generates at least one value for `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if the range function produces at least one value.
2. The range function `range(int(input()))` will produce values from 0 up to (but not including) the input value.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, the input value must be greater than 0.

Since the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not part of the loop head and are used within the loop body, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input value (which determines the number of test cases) is greater than 0.

State: **the input value (number of test cases) must be greater than 0**
