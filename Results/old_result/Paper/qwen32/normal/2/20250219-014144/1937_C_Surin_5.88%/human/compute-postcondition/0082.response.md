To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
   - `n`: Greater than 1 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
   - `p`: A permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1} (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
   - `I`: A lambda function (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
   - `R`: A lambda function (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
   - `g`: Initialized to 0 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
   - `v1`: The largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found. Since there's no indication of any loop iterations having occurred, `v1` is initialized to 0.
   - `prev`: Initialized to 0.
   - `i`: Initialized to 1.
   - `kp`: Initialized to 1 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   The print statement is:
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

   Substituting the known values:
   - `v1` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `prev` is 0.

3. **Formatted Output:**
   The formatted string will be:
   ```
   ? 0 1 0 0
   ```

Thus, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **? 0 1 0 0**
