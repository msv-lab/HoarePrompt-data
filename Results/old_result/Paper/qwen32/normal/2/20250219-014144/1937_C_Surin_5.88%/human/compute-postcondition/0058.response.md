Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **n**: Must be greater than 1.
3. **p**: A permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\).
4. **I**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
5. **R**: A lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
6. **g**: Initialized to 0.
7. **v1**: Initialized to 0.
8. **prev**: The last index \(i\) for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such \(i\) was found.
9. **i**: The new input integer.
10. **kp**: Initialized to 1.
11. **v2**: The new input integer \(i\).

### Print Statement Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is initialized to 0.
- `v2` is the new input integer `i`.

Given this information, the print statement will substitute `v1` with 0 and `v2` with the value of the new input integer `i`.

### Final Output Description
The print statement will output a formatted string where `v1` is 0 and `v2` is the value of the new input integer `i`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 [i] [i] (where i is the new input integer)**
