To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop evolves with each iteration. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided initially. Each iteration of the loop processes a separate test case, finding two specific indices based on some comparison logic.

Let's break down the loop and its state transitions:

1. **Initialization (`kp = 0`)**:
   - `n` is read as the size of the permutation.
   - `g` is initialized to 0 (though it doesn't seem to be used).
   - `v1` is initialized to 0.
   - The inner loop finds the largest index `v1` such that `r == '<'`.
   - Another inner loop finds the largest index `prev` such that `r == '>'`.
   - Finally, it prints `! prev v1`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations (`kp > 0`)**:
   - For each new iteration, `n` is read again, and the process repeats independently of previous iterations.

After all `t` iterations, the state will reflect the final iteration processed. Specifically, the variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, and `kp` will reflect the state of the last test case processed.

### Final Output State

- `t`: Remains the same as the initial number of test cases.
- `n`: Reflects the size of the permutation for the last test case.
- `p`: Remains the same as the initial permutation (not modified within the loop).
- `I` and `R`: Remain the same as the initial lambda functions (not modified within the loop).
- `g`: Always 0 (not modified within the loop).
- `v1`: The largest index `i` for which `r == '<'` was observed in the last test case.
- `prev`: The largest index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed in the last test case.
- `kp`: Equals `t-1` (since `kp` starts from 0 and increments until `t-1`).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed in the last test case, `prev` is the largest index i for which r == '>' was observed in the last test case, `i` is n-1, `kp` is t-1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the state reflects the processing of the last test case, with `v1` and `prev` being the results of the comparisons made in that last test case.
