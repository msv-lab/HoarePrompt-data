Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `v1` has been explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
