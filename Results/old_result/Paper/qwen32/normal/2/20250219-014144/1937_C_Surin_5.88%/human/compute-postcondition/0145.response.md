To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `n`: Greater than 1 (the size of the permutation `p`).
   - `p`: A permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}.
   - `I` and `R`: Lambda functions (not directly used in the print statement).
   - `g`: Set to 0.
   - `i`: Set to 3.
   - `kp`: Set to 2.
   - `v2`: Set to `n-1`.
   - `v1`: The highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` was found.
   - `r`: The new input received from the user.
   - `prev`: Set based on the value of `r`.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Values of the variables in the print statement:**
   - `v1`: This is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'`. Since no specific value for `r` is given, we assume it could be any value, but based on the description, if no such `i` was found, `v1` is 0.
   - `i`: This is explicitly set to 3.
   - `prev`: This is set based on the value of `r`. Since `r` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `prev`. However, we can infer that `prev` will be a value derived from `r` as per the logic of the program.

Given the lack of specific values for `r` and `prev`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Explanation:**
- `v1` will be either the highest index `i` where `r` was `'<'` or 0 if no such index exists.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `prev` is dependent on the value of `r`, which is not provided.

Therefore, the output will be in the form:
Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest index i for which r was '<' or 0 if no such i was found, and prev is set based on the value of r)**

However, since we need to provide a precise answer based on the given information, and assuming no specific `r` and thus `v1` being 0 and `prev` being undefined without `r`, we can simplify this to:
Output: **? 0 3 0 [prev] (where prev is set based on the value of r)**

But to strictly adhere to the format and given information:
Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest index i for which r was '<' or 0 if no such i was found, and prev is set based on the value of r)**
