The given code snippet includes `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the output device immediately. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v2`, `i`) are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is 5, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v2` is 4, `i` is 4**.
