To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1 (also not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1} (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `g` is 0 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
- `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `kp` is 1 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `r` is the user input (not directly relevant to the print statement).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `v1` is described as the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found. Since there is no additional information about the loop iterations or the value of `r`, we assume the worst-case scenario where no such `i` was found, making `v1` equal to 0.
- `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. Without knowing the value of `r`, we assume the default case where `prev` is 0.

Substituting these values into the print statement, we get:
- `v1` = 0
- `i` = 3
- `prev` = 0

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 3 0 0**
