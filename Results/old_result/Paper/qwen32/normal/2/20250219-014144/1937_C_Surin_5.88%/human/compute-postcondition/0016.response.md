Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is 5.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
- `g` is 0.
- `v2` is 4.
- `i` is 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement uses an f-string to format the output. The placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` need to be replaced with their respective values. 

However, there is a critical issue: the variable `v1` is not defined in the initial state. Since `v1` is not provided, we cannot determine its value based on the given information.

Given this, the output cannot be precisely determined because one of the key variables (`v1`) is missing from the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since `v1` is undefined, we cannot provide a precise output. However, if we assume that `v1` were defined, the output would follow the pattern `? v1 v1 v2 v2`.

Given the current state, the output will contain `v1` as an undefined variable.

Output: **? v1 v1 4 4 (where v1 is an undefined variable)**
