The given code snippet only updates the value of the variable `prev` to the value of `i`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that `prev` will now hold whatever value `i` held before this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is `i`, `r` is the input string, and `r` equals '>'**.
