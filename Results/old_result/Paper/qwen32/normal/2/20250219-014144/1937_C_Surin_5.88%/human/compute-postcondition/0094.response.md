To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Other variables (`t`, `p`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `prev` is 2 if `r` is `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, and `r` is the user input.**
