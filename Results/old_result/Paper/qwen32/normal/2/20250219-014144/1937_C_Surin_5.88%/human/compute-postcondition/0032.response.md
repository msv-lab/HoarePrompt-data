The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer to ensure that all buffered output is written to the standard output. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the given initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`) are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is 0**.
