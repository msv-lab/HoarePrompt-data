To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}
- `I` is a lambda function
- `R` is a lambda function
- `g` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `kp` is 2
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` was found
- `r` is the new input received from the user
- If `r` equals `'>'`, then `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. The variable `n` does not change within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` was found, `r` is the new input received from the user, and `prev` is set based on the value of `r` as described.**
