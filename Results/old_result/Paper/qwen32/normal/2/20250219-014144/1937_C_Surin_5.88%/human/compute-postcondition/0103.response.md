The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than the input value, which is converted to an integer. At the end of the last iteration, `kp` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 2**
