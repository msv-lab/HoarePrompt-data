Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `x` is less than `y`, and `y` is less than or equal to `z`. If `y` is less than `z`, `res` is 'stair'. If `y` is equal to `z`, `res` is 'none'.**
