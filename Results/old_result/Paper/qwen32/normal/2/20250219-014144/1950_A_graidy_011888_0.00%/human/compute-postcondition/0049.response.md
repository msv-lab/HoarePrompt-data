Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This indicates the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. These are not used in the provided print statement, so they do not affect the output.
- `i` is set to 3. This variable is also not used in the provided print statement.
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are new random integers between 1 and 9 for each test case.
- The logic to determine `res` is described but not relevant to the current print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces.
- Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their specific values cannot be determined without running the code.
- However, we can describe the output format precisely.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output three space-separated integers, each between 1 and 9 inclusive.

### Final Output:
Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
