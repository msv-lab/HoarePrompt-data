You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9. For each set, it determines if the sequence is strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or neither, and prints the corresponding result ('peak', 'stair', or 'none').

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The problem requires reading input from the user, specifically the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The program instead generates random numbers for `x`, `y`, and `z` and checks if they form a stair, peak, or neither. This is not aligned with the problem statement which requires processing specific inputs.
3. The program outputs the generated numbers along with their classification, which is not required by the problem statement. The problem only asks for the classification ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each set of inputs.
4. The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It runs a fixed number of iterations (1000) regardless of the input value `t`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
