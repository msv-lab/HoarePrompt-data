The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This operation changes the length of `l2` and shifts the elements at and after `idx1` one position to the right.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is 2.
- `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`.
- `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged.
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
- `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`.
- `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.
- `a3` is 4.
- `l3` is [5, 6, 7].
- The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.

After executing `l2.insert(idx1, a2)`, the list `l2` will have `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 2; `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` remains unchanged; `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is 4; `l3` is [5, 6, 7]; the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
