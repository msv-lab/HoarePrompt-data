The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. This means `l` now holds the same list as `l1`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`
- `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged
- `idx1` is not `-1`
- `idx2` is `n - 2`
- `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively
- `val` is an empty list
- `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`

After executing `l = l1`, the new state includes `l` being equal to `l1`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx2` is `n - 2`; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list; `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`; `l` is equal to `l1`.**
