The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. This operation modifies the list `l1` by increasing its length by one and shifting elements to the right starting from `idx2`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l1` because the `insert` method modifies it in place. All other variables remain unchanged.

Since the exact contents of `l1`, `a1`, and `idx2` are not specified, we can only describe the change in `l1` in terms of these variables. Specifically, `a1` is inserted at the position `idx2` in `l1`.

Output State: **`m` is 2; `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2`; `l2` remains unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a3` is 4; `l3` is [5, 6, 7]; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In simpler terms: The list `l1` now contains `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
