To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop.

### Initial Conditions and Loop Behavior:
- The initial state sets `_` based on whether `l11` equals `l22`.
- `t` is set such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
- `idx1` is not `-1`.
- Depending on the relationship between `idx1` and `idx2`, certain modifications are made to `l1` or `l2`.
- `val` is constructed based on conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2`.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration**: `val` contains `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`. The loop checks if `l3` (`[5, 6, 7]`) matches the list obtained by removing `a3` (`4`) from `l`.
- **Second Iteration**: The same check is performed with the same `val` content.
- **Third Iteration**: `val` now includes an additional tuple `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`. The loop checks if `l3` (`[9, 10, 11]`) matches the list obtained by removing `a3` (`8`) from `l`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the state remains consistent with the initial conditions except for the `val` list, which accumulates tuples as per the loop's logic. Since no breaking condition (`l3` not matching the expected list) was mentioned in the provided output states, we assume the loop completes all iterations without breaking.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will reflect that all iterations completed successfully, and `val` will contain all the tuples that were added during the loop's execution.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`.**

In simpler terms, the final state shows that the variable `_` is set based on the equality of `l11` and `l22`, `t` is greater than `_`, `n` and `m` stay the same, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` remain the same, `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and `val` contains the tuples `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`.
