Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `_` is defined based on the condition `l11 == l22`:
  - If `l11 == l22`, then `_ = n - 1`
  - Otherwise, `_ = n + m - 2`

- `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.

- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.

- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.

- `idx1` is not `-1`.

- `idx1 <= idx2`.

- `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`.

- `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'no'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `l3`) are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:

The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
