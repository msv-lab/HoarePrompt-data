The given code snippet inserts the value `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Since the initial state does not include `l1`, `a1`, or `idx2`, we'll assume these are defined elsewhere in the code, and we'll focus on how `l1` changes.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input
- `a3` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line
- The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`

The code modifies `l1` by inserting `a1` at the position `idx2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l1` has `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `a1` is now part of `l1` at the position `idx2`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
