Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `a1`: The first integer from the input.
   - `l1`: A list of the remaining integers from the input.
   - `a2`: Fixed value 12.
   - `l2`: Fixed list `[13, 14, 15]`.
   - `l11`: A list derived from `l1` excluding any occurrences of 12.
   - `l22`: A list derived from `l2` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `val`: An empty list `[]`.
   - `_`: Initially set to `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged.
   - `t`: A threshold value such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
   - `n`: A value read from the input.
   - `m`: Fixed value 2.
   - `i`: Set to `n - 1`.
   - `p1` and `p2`: Determined by comparisons made during iterations.
   - `idx1`: Initially -1, updated to `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`.
   - `idx2`: Initially -1, updated to `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`.
   - `idx1 <= idx2`: This is a condition but doesn't affect the print statement directly.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only one line:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('yes')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or lists described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the print statement is independent of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state, the output will be the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
