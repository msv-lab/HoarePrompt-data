t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Following the integers n and k, there are k lists, each containing n distinct integers a_{ij} such that 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n. All a_{ij} in each list are different, and the first element of each list represents the author of the screenshot.
