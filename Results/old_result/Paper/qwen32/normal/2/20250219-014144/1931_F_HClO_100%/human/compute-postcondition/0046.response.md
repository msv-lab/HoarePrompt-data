The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `3` (as an example, since it's not explicitly given but we know it must be `n-2` to be the last iteration before `n-1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, if `i` was `3` at the end of the last iteration, it should be `4` at the start of the next iteration. This means the loop can execute again if `n - 1` is greater than `4`, i.e., `n` must be at least `5`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx1` and `idx2`. `i` is 4**
