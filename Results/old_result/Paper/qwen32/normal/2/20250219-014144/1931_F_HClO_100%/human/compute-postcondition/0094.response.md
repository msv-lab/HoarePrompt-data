The code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the remaining integers to the list `l3`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged unless `m` equals 2, in which case their state is already defined by the if part postcondition.

Given the initial state, the only changes occur to `a3` and `l3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; if `m` equals 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the if part postcondition; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the precondition; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
