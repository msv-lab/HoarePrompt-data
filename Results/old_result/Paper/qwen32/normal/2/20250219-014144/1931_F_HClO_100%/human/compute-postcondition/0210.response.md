The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. This operation changes the length of `l2` by adding one element, and it shifts all elements that were originally at or after `idx1` one position to the right.

Given the initial conditions:
- `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`. This value remains unchanged.
- `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`. This condition remains unchanged.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged except for the insertion.
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
- If `idx2` was initially `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, then `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. This condition remains unchanged.
- `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`. This condition remains unchanged.
- `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively. These values remain unchanged.
- `val` is an empty list. This remains unchanged.
- `idx1` is less than `idx2`. This condition may change because the insertion could affect the indices.

After the insertion, `l2` will have one more element, and `idx2` might need to be adjusted if it was not `-1` initially. Since `idx1` is less than `idx2`, and `idx2` was not `-1`, `idx2` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the new position of elements in `l2`.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` remains unchanged; `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; if `idx2` was initially `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, then `idx2` is `n - 2`; `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`; `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`**.
