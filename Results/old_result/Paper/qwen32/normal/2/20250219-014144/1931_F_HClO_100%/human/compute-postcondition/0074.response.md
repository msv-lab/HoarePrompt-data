To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and outputs after the first three iterations.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
   - `a1` and `l1` are read from one input line.
   - `a2` and `l2` are read from another input line.
   - `l11` and `l22` are derived from `l1` and `l2` respectively, excluding `a2` and `a1`.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are initialized to -1.
   - `p1` and `p2` are initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `n - 1` iterations.
   - It breaks if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`.
     - If they are not equal, it checks if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
       - If so, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to `i` and breaks.
       - Otherwise, it updates `idx1` or `idx2` based on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` respectively.
       - If both `idx1` and `idx2` become non-negative, it breaks.
     - If they are equal, no changes are made.

3. **Output States after Iterations**:
   - After 1 iteration (`i = 0`): No specific changes mentioned.
   - After 2 iterations (`i = 1`): No specific changes mentioned.
   - After 3 iterations (`i = 2`): No specific changes mentioned.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will continue until either `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative.
- Since the problem doesn't specify any changes in `idx1` and `idx2` being non-negative within the first three iterations, we assume the loop completes its full run unless it breaks due to the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will iterate `n - 1` times unless it breaks early.
- If it breaks early, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where the mismatch occurs with `a2` and `a1`.
- If it completes all iterations without breaking early, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` and `idx2` to non-negative values.`**

In simpler terms, the loop completes all iterations without finding a mismatch involving `a2` and `a1`, so `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1.
