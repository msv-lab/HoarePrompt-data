Postcondition: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is `[13, 14, 15]`, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is `[13, 14, 15]` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`, `val` is either an empty list or contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is the value read from the input minus 1 if `idx1 <= idx2`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2` if the if condition is satisfied, otherwise `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. If `m` is 2, then `_` is updated to `x + (m - 2)` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2` with `12` inserted at index `n - 2`.**
