The given Python code snippet appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that the list `val` will now contain an additional element which is a tuple consisting of the integer `a3` and the list `l3`.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a3` is the first integer from a new input line, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from that same new input line. Additionally, there are conditions related to the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` that determine whether `l1` or `l2` is used to form `l`, but these conditions do not affect the current operation since the code only modifies `val`.

After executing the code, the only change is that `val` now includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)`**.
