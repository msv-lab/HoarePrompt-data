Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is `[13, 14, 15]` unless `idx1` is less than `idx2`, in which case `l2` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`. `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is `[13, 14, 15]` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`. `val` is either an empty list or contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` if `idx1 >= idx2`. `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged. `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`. `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is the value read from the input minus 1 if `idx1 <= idx2`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is `[13, 14, 15]` unless `idx1` is less than `idx2`, in which case `l2` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`. `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is `[13, 14, 15]` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`. `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`. `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged. `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`. `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`. `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is `[13, 14, 15]` unless `idx1` is less than `idx2`, in which case `l2` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is `[13, 14, 15]` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`, `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `x + (m - 2) + 1` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) + 1 < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`. `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is `[13, 14, 15]` unless `idx1` is less than `idx2`, in which case `l2` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is `[13, 14, 15]` excluding `a1` if `a1` is in `[13, 14, 15]`, `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `x + (m - 2) + 2` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) + 2 < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is modified to place `12` at the position corresponding to `idx1`. `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
