The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `i` to `idx1`.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1; if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `idx1` is equal to `i`.**
