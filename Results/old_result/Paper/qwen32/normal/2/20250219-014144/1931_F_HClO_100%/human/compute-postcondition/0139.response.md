Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`.**

In simple terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that a new list `l22` is created. This new list contains all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
