To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop continues or breaks. The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val` and checks if `l3` matches the list `l` with `a3` removed. If any `l3` does not match, the loop prints "no" and breaks. Otherwise, it prints "yes" after completing all iterations.

From the provided information, we know the following:
- The loop has executed 3 times without breaking, meaning `l3` matched the expected list `[i for i in l if i != a3]` for each of the first 3 tuples in `val`.
- The loop will continue until it either completes all iterations or finds a mismatch.

Let's assume `val` contains more than 3 tuples. For the loop to finish all iterations, `l3` must match the expected list for every tuple in `val`.

### Final Output State:
- Since the loop did not break after the first 3 iterations, it will continue to check the remaining tuples in `val`.
- If all tuples in `val` satisfy the condition `l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop will complete all iterations and print "yes".
- If there are no more tuples in `val` to check, the loop will also print "yes".

Thus, the final output state will be based on whether all tuples in `val` satisfy the condition. Assuming all tuples do satisfy the condition, the final output state will be:

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints "yes".**

In natural language, this means that after checking all tuples in `val`, the loop determines that each `l3` matches the list `l` with `a3` removed, so it prints "yes" and ends.
