Postcondition: **`_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` are the values read from the input; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`. If `m` is not equal to 1, there is no change to the state described above.**
