The code assigns the value of `k` to a new variable `k0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, or `arr`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `k0` with the same value as `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
