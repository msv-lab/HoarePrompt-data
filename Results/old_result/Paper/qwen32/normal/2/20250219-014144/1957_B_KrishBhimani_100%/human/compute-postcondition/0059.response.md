Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is `2 * temp`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `temp` is 1.**
