The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, `k0`, `i`, or `temp`. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement, but since there is no loop or switch statement in the given context, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with the exception of the presence of the `break` statement which does not alter any variable values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is `2 * temp`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `temp` is 1.**
