The given code snippet modifies the value of `temp` by multiplying it by 2. We need to determine the new value of `temp` based on its initial condition.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` is a list of strings
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`
- `temp` is either `4 * temp` if initially `temp * 2` was less than `k`, otherwise `temp` remains 1

The code snippet is:
```python
temp *= 2
```

Impact:
- The value of `temp` is doubled.

Since the initial value of `temp` depends on the condition `temp * 2 < k`, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If `temp * 2` was initially less than `k`, then `temp` was set to `4 * temp`. After the operation `temp *= 2`, the new value of `temp` will be `8 * temp`.
2. If `temp * 2` was initially not less than `k`, then `temp` was set to 1. After the operation `temp *= 2`, the new value of `temp` will be 2.

However, since the exact initial value of `temp` is not specified beyond these conditions, we can only express the new value of `temp` in terms of its initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either `8 * temp` (if initially `temp * 2` was less than `k`) or `2` (if initially `temp * 2` was not less than `k`).**
