The code snippet provided increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial conditions, `i` could either be 1 or 0. After executing `i += 1`, if `i` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `i` is 2 if `i` was initially 1, otherwise `i` is 1; `temp` is 4 if `temp` was initially 2, otherwise `temp` is 2; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is an empty list; `temp * 2` is less than `k` if `i` is 1, otherwise `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
