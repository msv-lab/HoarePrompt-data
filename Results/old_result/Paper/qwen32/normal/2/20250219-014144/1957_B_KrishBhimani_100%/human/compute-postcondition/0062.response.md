The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. 

Given that `ans` initially contains one element `(1 << i) - 1`, the new element appended will be `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`. This means the list `ans` will now have two elements: the original element and the newly calculated element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is a list containing two elements `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
