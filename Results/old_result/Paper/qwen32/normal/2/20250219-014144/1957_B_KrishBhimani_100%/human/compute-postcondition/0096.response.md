Let's break down the given initial state and determine the values of the variables involved to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`l1`**: A new list of strings obtained from the input.
3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.
4. **`k`**: The integer value of the second element of the new `l1`.
5. **`arr`**: An empty list (not used in the given print statement).
6. **`i`**: The maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true.
7. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
8. **`k0`**: Equal to `k` (not used in the given print statement).
9. **The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1** (This suggests that there might be a loop that has run once, but it doesn't affect the current state directly).
10. **`ans`**: A list containing the elements `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros.

### Calculation of Variables:

- **`temp`**: This is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. For example, if `k` is 10, then `temp` would be 8 (since \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\) which is greater than 10).
- **`i`**: This is the exponent such that `temp = 2^i`. Continuing with the example where `k` is 10, `i` would be 3 because \(2^3 = 8\).
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
  - The first element is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\). For `i = 3`, this would be \(2^3 - 1 = 7\).
  - The second element is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which is \(k - (2^i - 1)\). For `k = 10` and `i = 3`, this would be \(10 - 7 = 3\).
  - The remaining `n - 2` elements are zeros.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `n = 5` and `k = 10` for concreteness:
- `temp` would be 8 (largest power of 2 less than 10).
- `i` would be 3 (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
- `ans` would be `[7, 3, 0, 0]` (two zeros because `n - 2 = 3`).

### Final Output:

Given the above calculations, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **7 3 0 0 (where n = 5 and k = 10)**

However, since `n` and `k` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we should express the output in terms of `n` and `k`.

Output: **(1 << i) - 1 k - ((1 << i) - 1) followed by n - 2 zeros (where i is the largest integer such that (1 << i) < k)**
