### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the algorithm correctly computes the minimum total cost to sort each binary string in non-descending order using the allowed operations.

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
4. It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
5. It initializes `ans` to store the total cost.
6. It iterates through each character `c` in the string:
   - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of zeros in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there has been at least one 1 encountered before (indicating that this zero needs to be moved past at least one 1).
   - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeros (total zeros minus the count of zeros encountered so far) to `ans` (indicating that this one needs to be moved past all remaining zeros).
7. Finally, it prints the computed `ans` for each test case.

This approach essentially calculates the cost of moving all 0s to the left of all 1s by considering how many 1s each 0 needs to pass and how many 0s each 1 needs to pass. This is a correct way to compute the minimum cost because every time a 0 needs to be moved past a 1, it incurs a cost proportional to the length of the substring being shifted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
