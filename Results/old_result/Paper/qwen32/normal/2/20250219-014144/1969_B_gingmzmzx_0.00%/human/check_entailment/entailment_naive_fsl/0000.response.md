Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string `s` to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s).
- The cost of shifting a substring `s_l ... s_r` is `r - l + 1`.
- We need to minimize the total cost to achieve the sorted string.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using a specific approach:
1. It counts the number of zeros in the string.
2. It iterates through the string and keeps track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
3. For each character, it updates the cost based on whether the character is 0 or 1.

Let's break down the logic:
- If the current character is 0, it adds 1 to the cost if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
- If the current character is 1, it adds the remaining number of zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.

### Correctness Check:
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that this approach accurately computes the minimum cost to sort the string for all possible inputs.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input:** `10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Shift the entire string `10 -> 01` with cost `2`.

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Already sorted.

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Multiple shifts required to move all 0s to the front.

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: Multiple shifts required to move all 0s to the front.

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - Expected Output: `11`
   - Explanation: Multiple shifts required to move all 0s to the front.

Let's check if the program handles these cases correctly:

- For `10`, the program will output `2` because the first character is `1` and the second character is `0`, so it adds `1` (since there was a `1` before) and `1` (since there is one `0` left).
- For `0000`, the program will output `0` because there are no `1`s to consider.
- For `11000`, the program will output `9` because it correctly accounts for the cost of moving all 0s to the front.
- For `101011`, the program will output `5` because it correctly accounts for the cost of moving all 0s to the front.
- For `01101001`, the program will output `11` because it correctly accounts for the cost of moving all 0s to the front.

After analyzing the provided program and the example test cases, it seems that the program correctly computes the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described logic.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for all provided test cases and seems to handle the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**.
