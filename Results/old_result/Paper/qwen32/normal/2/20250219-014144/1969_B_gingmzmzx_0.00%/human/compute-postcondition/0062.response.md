The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s` after the current `c`, and `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, the value of `c` can only be `0` or `1`.

If `c` is `0`, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is `1`, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

Since `zeroes` is the count of `0`s in `s`, and `c` is the next element in `s`, if `c` is `0`, `zeroes` remains unchanged because the increment affects `cnt` and not `zeroes`. If `c` is `1`, `zeroes` also remains unchanged for the same reason.

Therefore, the updated state will reflect the incremented value in `cnt` at the index corresponding to `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is either `[1+1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[1, 0+1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` after the current `c`.**
