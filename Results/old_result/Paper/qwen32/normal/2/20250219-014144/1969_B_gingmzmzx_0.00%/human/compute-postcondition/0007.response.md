The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` is initialized as `[0, 0]`, this operation will increase either the first or the second element of `cnt` by 1, depending on the value of `c`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `c`, we cannot determine which element of `cnt` will be incremented. However, we know that `c` must be either 0 or 1 because `s` is a list of integers consisting only of 0s and 1s, and `c` is likely derived from an element of `s`.

Thus, after executing the code, `cnt` will have one of its elements incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] depending on the value of `c`, `ans` is 0**.
