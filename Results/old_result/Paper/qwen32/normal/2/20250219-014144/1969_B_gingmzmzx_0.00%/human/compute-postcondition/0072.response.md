To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `cnt` is a list containing two elements: `[zeroes, n - zeroes]`.
- `ans` is described as the accumulated result based on some loop's logic.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is defined but it is not directly used in the `print(ans)` statement.
- The variable `ans` is the result of some computation or accumulation process within a loop, but the specific details of this loop and how `ans` is computed are not provided.

Since the exact computation or accumulation process leading to the value of `ans` is not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of its role as the accumulated result from the loop.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated result based on the loop's logic)**
