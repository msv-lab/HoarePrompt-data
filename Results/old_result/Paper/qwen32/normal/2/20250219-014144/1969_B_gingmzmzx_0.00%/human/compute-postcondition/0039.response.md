The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` increments the variable `ans` by 1 if the second element of the list `cnt` is greater than 0; otherwise, it does not change `ans`.

Given the initial state, `cnt` is either `[1, 1]` if `c` is 0 or `[1, 0]` if `c` is 1. Therefore, `cnt[1]` is either 1 or 0.

- If `c` is 0, then `cnt` is `[1, 1]` and `cnt[1]` is 1, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, then `cnt` is `[1, 0]` and `cnt[1]` is 0, so `ans` remains unchanged.

Other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the current list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 1]` if `c` is 0 or `[1, 0]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
