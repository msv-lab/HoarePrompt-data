The code snippet calculates the number of zeroes in the list `s` and assigns this count to the variable `zeroes`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` needs recalculating, `ans` needs recalculating.**
