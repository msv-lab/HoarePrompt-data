Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens required. Specifically, the logic for handling cases where both `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons) are greater than zero is incorrect.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Mixed Icons:**
   - The program calculates `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
   - However, the subsequent calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the space used by the 2x2 icons when calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
   - The term `bxsfory * 15` suggests that each 2x2 icon occupies 15 cells, which is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon actually occupies 4 cells.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program should calculate the remaining space available on the screens that already contain 2x2 icons and then determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The current approach does not properly account for the fact that some screens may still have space left after placing 2x2 icons.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- Determine the remaining space on those screens.
- Calculate how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        # Total cells occupied by 2x2 icons
        cells_used_by_2x2 = y * 4
        
        # Remaining cells on screens used for 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells_on_2x2_screens = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - cells_used_by_2x2
        
        # Remaining 1x1 icons after using space on 2x2 screens
        remaining_1x1_icons = x - remaining_cells_on_2x2_screens
        
        # If remaining 1x1 icons are negative, set to 0
        if remaining_1x1_icons < 0:
            remaining_1x1_icons = 0
        
        # Calculate screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1_icons / 15)
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)

func_1()
```

This corrected program properly accounts for the space used by 2x2 icons and calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
