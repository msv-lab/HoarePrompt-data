The only variable in the loop head is `k` and `ap`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- The updates to `x` and `bxsfory1` depend on the conditions involving `x` and `y`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` would have taken a value from 0 to `ap-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than `ap`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `k` should be incremented by 1.
- `ap` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `k` is incremented by 1**.
