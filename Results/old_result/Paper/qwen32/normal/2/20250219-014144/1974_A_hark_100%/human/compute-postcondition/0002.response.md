The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` within specified ranges. The variable `ap` must be greater than 0, but it is not modified by the provided code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `t` and `ap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.**
