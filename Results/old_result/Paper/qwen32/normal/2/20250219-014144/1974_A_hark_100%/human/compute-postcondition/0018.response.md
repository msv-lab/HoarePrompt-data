Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(updated x / 15)`. If at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, then `x` and `y` retain their original values, with the condition that if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `y` remains a positive integer.**
