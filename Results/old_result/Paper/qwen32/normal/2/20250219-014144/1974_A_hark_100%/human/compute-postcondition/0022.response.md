The given code modifies the value of `x` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and `bxsfory`. Here's the updated value of `x`:

`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`

Given that `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, we can express the new value of `x` as:

`x = x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`

All other variables (`t`, `ap`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the same integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99, `k` is incremented by 1, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**
