Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and `k` is incremented by 1. If both `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4` and `bxsfory` is set to the ceiling of `y / 2`; `bxsfory1` is `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their original values.**
