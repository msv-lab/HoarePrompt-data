Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the integer provided in the input, `k` is incremented by 1, and `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`. `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x <= 0` else `math.ceil(x / 15)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `bxsfory1` is determined based on the condition of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is set to 0. Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is set to `math.ceil(x / 15)`. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described in the initial conditions.
