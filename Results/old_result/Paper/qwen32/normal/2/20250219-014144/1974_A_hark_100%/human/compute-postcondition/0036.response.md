To determine what will be printed by the `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable does not affect the calculation of `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` directly).
   - `ap`: Greater than 0 (This variable does not affect the calculation of `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` directly).
   - `x`: Updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - `y`: The integer provided in the input.
   - `k`: Incremented by 1 (This variable does not affect the calculation of `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` directly).
   - `bxsfory`: Calculated as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - `bxsfory1`: 0 if `x <= 0` else `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

2. **Calculation of `bxsfory`:**
   - `bxsfory` is calculated as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which means it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

3. **Calculation of `bxsfory1`:**
   - `bxsfory1` depends on the value of `x` after the update `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
   - If `x <= 0` after this update, then `bxsfory1` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The print statement outputs the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.
   - Since `bxsfory` is determined solely by `y` and `bxsfory1` is determined by the updated value of `x`, the final output will be the sum of these two values.

Given the above steps, the output can be described as follows:

- `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- `bxsfory1` is either 0 (if `x <= 0`) or the ceiling of `x / 15` (if `x > 0`).

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the sum of these two values.

Output: **bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2) and bxsfory1 is 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15))**
