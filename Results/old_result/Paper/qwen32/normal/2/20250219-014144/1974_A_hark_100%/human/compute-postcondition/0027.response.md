Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `k` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the integer `0`. None of the variables (`t`, `ap`, `x`, `y`, `k`) are used in this particular `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
