Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but called before its definition, which would normally cause a `NameError`. However, since the code snippet provided does not show the actual execution context, we'll assume that the function call is correctly placed elsewhere in the full code.
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ap` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Screens:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
     - The program calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate all `2x2` icons.
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (which seems incorrect as it should be `bxsfory * 4` since each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells) and adding `y * 4` (this operation doesn't make sense in the context of the problem).
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15 (which again seems incorrect as it should be divided by 15 to see how many additional screens are needed for the remaining `1x1` icons).
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**
     - The program correctly calculates and prints the ceiling of `y / 2` as the number of screens needed for the `2x2` icons.
   
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**
     - The program correctly calculates and prints the ceiling of `x / 15` as the number of screens needed for the `1x1` icons.
   
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
     - The program correctly prints `0` as no screens are needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is flawed. Specifically, the adjustment of `x` and the calculation of `bxsfory1` do not correctly account for the placement of icons.
- The formula used to adjust `x` (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`) and the subsequent division by 15 to calculate `bxsfory1` are incorrect. The correct approach should involve calculating the remaining space after placing the `2x2` icons and then determining how many `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining space.

### Correct Approach:
- First, place all `2x2` icons. Since each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, you need to determine how many screens are required for the `2x2` icons.
- After placing the `2x2` icons, calculate the remaining space on the last partially filled screen and determine how many `1x1` icons can fit into this remaining space.
- Place the remaining `1x1` icons on additional screens as needed.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues in the logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
