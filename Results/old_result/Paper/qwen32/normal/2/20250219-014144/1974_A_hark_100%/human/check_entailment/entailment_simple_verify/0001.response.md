### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Function Call Before Definition:
The program calls `func_1()` before defining it, which results in a `NameError`. This is indeed a critical issue that needs to be fixed for the program to run correctly.

#### Calculation Logic:
Let's break down the logic for different scenarios:

1. **Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
   - The program calculates `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells and a 5x3 grid can fit 2 2x2 icons).
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The term `bxsfory * 15` suggests that `bxsfory` screens are used, each containing 15 cells, but this is not how the calculation should proceed. Instead, we should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y`.
   - Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed: `remaining_x = x - (15 * bxsfory - 4 * y)`.
   - Finally, calculate `bxsfory1` as `math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)` and print `bxsfory + bxsfory1`.

2. **`x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
   - The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(y / 2)` and prints it. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

3. **`x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
   - The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(x / 15)` and prints it. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

4. **Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
   - The program correctly prints 0 because no screens are needed.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the program's state at key points but do not address the logical errors in the calculation when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
The program has a syntax error due to the function call before its definition and a logical error in the calculation when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Therefore, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Final: False**
