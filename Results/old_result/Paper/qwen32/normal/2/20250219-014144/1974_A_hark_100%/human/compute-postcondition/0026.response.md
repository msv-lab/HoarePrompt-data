To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable does not affect the current print statement.
- `ap` is greater than 0. This variable also does not affect the current print statement.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `k` is incremented by 1. This variable does not affect the current print statement.

The only relevant variable here is `x`, which is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive. The `print` statement computes the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15. The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.

Let's consider the range of possible values for `x / 15`:
- When `x = 0`, `x / 15 = 0.0`, and `math.ceil(0.0) = 0`.
- When `x = 1` to `14`, `x / 15` is between 0.0667 and 0.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15) = 1`.
- When `x = 15` to `29`, `x / 15` is between 1.0 and 1.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15) = 2`.
- When `x = 30` to `44`, `x / 15` is between 2.0 and 2.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15) = 3`.
- When `x = 45` to `59`, `x / 15` is between 3.0 and 3.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15) = 4`.
- When `x = 60` to `74`, `x / 15` is between 4.0 and 4.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15) = 5`.
- When `x = 75` to `89`, `x / 15` is between 5.0 and 5.9333, and `math.ceil(x / 15) = 6`.
- When `x = 90` to `99`, `x / 15` is between 6.0 and 6.6, and `math.ceil(x / 15) = 7`.

Therefore, the output of `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` depends on the specific value of `x` but will be an integer between 0 and 7.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is an integer between 0 and 99)**
