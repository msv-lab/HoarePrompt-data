To determine the new value of `x` after executing the given line of code, we need to apply the formula provided:

\[ x = x - \text{bxsfory} \times 15 + y \times 4 \]

Given that `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, we can express `bxsfory` mathematically as:

\[ \text{bxsfory} = \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil \]

This means that `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Let's substitute `bxsfory` into the equation for `x`:

\[ x = x - \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil \times 15 + y \times 4 \]

After this calculation, the value of `x` will be updated.

The other variables (`t`, `ap`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `y` is the integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99 and y > 0, `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`.**
