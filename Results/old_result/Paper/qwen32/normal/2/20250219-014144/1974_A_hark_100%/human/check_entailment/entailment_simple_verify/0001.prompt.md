You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by calling `func_1()` before defining it, which will result in a `NameError` because `func_1()` is not defined at the point of its initial call. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed for the program to run correctly.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - Once the function definition is corrected, the program reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Calculating Screens Needed:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells and a 5x3 grid can fit 2 2x2 icons).
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons) and adding `y * 4` (which seems incorrect and unnecessary since we already accounted for the cells occupied by 2x2 icons). This adjustment is incorrect and should be revised.
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the remaining `x` divided by 15, which represents the minimum number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
     - It simply prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is correct as explained above.
   
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
     - It prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is correct as explained above.
   
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - It prints 0, which is correct as no screens are needed.

### Issues Identified:
- **Function Call Before Definition:** The program calls `func_1()` before defining it, which will cause a runtime error.
- **Incorrect Adjustment of `x`:** The adjustment of `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4` is incorrect. We should only consider the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

### Revised Calculation:
- When both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
  - Calculate `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
  - Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y`.
  - Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed: `remaining_x = x - (15 * bxsfory - 4 * y)`.
  - Calculate `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of `remaining_x / 15`.
  - Print `bxsfory + bxsfory1`.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical issues and a syntax error due to the function call before its definition. Therefore, it is not correct as it stands.
