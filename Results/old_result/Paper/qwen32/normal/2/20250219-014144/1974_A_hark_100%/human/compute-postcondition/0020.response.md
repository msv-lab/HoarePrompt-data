The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input. The other variables (`t`, `ap`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `k` is incremented by 1**. 

In simpler terms, `x` and `y` now hold the values read from the input, while `t`, `ap`, and `k` retain their original values with `k` having been incremented by 1.
