To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet based on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `ap` is greater than 0
- `y` is the integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99 and y > 0
- `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`

Code Snippet:
```python
bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
```

Let's analyze the code snippet:
- `bxsfory1` is assigned a value based on the condition `x <= 0`.
- If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is set to `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

Since `x` has already been updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, we need to consider this updated value of `x` when determining `bxsfory1`.

The value of `bxsfory1` depends on whether the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0 or greater than 0. 

Thus, the output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `ap` remains greater than 0
- `y` remains the integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99 and y > 0
- `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`
- `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(updated x / 15)`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `y` is the integer read from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 99 and y > 0, `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(updated x / 15)`**
