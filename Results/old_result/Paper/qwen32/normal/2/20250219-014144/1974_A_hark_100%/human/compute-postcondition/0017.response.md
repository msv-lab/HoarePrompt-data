Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and at least one of `x` or `y` is 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `y` remains a positive integer. Otherwise, either `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or both `x` and `y` are 0.**
