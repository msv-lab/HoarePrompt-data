Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input; `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `count` is the number of times `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` equals 1 for `i` ranging from 0 to `x - 2`; `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. The current value of `num` is 1.**
