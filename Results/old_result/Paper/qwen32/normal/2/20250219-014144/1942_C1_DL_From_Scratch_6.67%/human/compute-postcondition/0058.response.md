Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 1, `n` and `y` are integers read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `i` is `x - 2`. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
