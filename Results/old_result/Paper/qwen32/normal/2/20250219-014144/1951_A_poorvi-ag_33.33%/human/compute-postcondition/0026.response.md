Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user. If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr'), `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, if `arr.count('1') % 2 == 0`, `results` contains the string 'yes'; otherwise, `results` contains the string 'no'. `i` is incremented by 1.**
