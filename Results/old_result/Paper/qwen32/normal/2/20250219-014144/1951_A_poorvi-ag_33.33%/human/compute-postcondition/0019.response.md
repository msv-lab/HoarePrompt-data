The code snippet `arr = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `arr`. This means the previous value of `arr` is overwritten by the new input string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr'), `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's and does not have '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the single element 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'; `i` is incremented by 1. `n` is now the integer input by the user.**
