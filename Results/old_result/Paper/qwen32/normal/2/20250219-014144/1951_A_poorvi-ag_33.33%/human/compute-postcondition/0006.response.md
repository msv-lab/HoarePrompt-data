Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string 'no'; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user, and `arr` contains exactly two occurrences of the character '1' with these two '1's being consecutive ('11' is a substring of `arr`).**

Explanation: The `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains the string 'no'. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
