To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list of length `t+1` containing either `'yes'` or `'no'`.
- `r` is the next element in `results`.

The key point here is understanding what `r` refers to. Since `r` is described as "the next element in `results`," it implies that `r` is one of the elements in the `results` list. However, without knowing the specific index of `r` within the `results` list, we can only describe `r` in terms of the possible values it could take from the `results` list.

Given that `results` contains only `'yes'` or `'no'`, `r` must also be either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

Therefore, the `print(r)` statement will output either `'yes'` or `'no'`, depending on the specific value assigned to `r` in the `results` list.

Output: **r (where r is either 'yes' or 'no', an element of the results list)**
