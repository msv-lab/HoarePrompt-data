Let's analyze the given task step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list of length `t` containing `'yes'` or `'no'`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet attempts to print the variable `r`.
- However, there is no mention of the variable `r` in the initial state description. This means that `r` is either undefined or not provided in the context.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `r` is not defined in the initial state, attempting to print it would result in a `NameError` in Python. Therefore, the code as given will not execute successfully without additional context or definition of `r`.

However, if we assume that the intention was to print `results` instead of `r` (a common typo), then the output would depend on the contents of the `results` list.

Given the current state and the code snippet, the precise output cannot be determined because `r` is not defined. But if we hypothetically consider `r` to be `results`, the output would be the contents of the `results` list.

For the sake of providing a structured answer based on the given format, let's assume the intention was to print `results`:

### Hypothetical Output (Assuming `r` was meant to be `results`):
Output: **results (where results is a list of length t containing 'yes' or 'no')**

But since the actual variable `r` is not defined, the correct and precise answer based on the given information is that the code will raise an error.

### Final Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'r' is not defined**
