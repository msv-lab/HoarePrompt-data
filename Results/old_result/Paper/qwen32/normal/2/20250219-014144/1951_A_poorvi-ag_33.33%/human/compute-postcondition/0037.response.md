To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `results` list based on the inputs provided during each iteration.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior:
- For each iteration, the loop reads an integer `n` and a string `arr`.
- It checks if `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's (`'11'` is a substring of `arr`). If so, it appends `'no'` to `results`.
- If `arr` does not contain exactly two consecutive '1's, it then checks if the count of '1's in `arr` is even. If it is, it appends `'yes'` to `results`; otherwise, it appends `'no'`.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified initially.
- After each iteration, the `results` list is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.

After all `t` iterations, the `results` list will contain a series of `'yes'` and `'no'` strings based on the inputs provided during each iteration.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations can be described as follows:
- `start` and `end` remain unchanged as non-negative integers with `start <= end`.
- `t` remains the same, indicating the total number of iterations.
- `n` and `arr` will be the values from the last iteration, but they do not affect the final `results` list directly.
- `results` will be a list of length `t`, containing `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is the number of iterations; `results` is a list of length `t` containing `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration.**
