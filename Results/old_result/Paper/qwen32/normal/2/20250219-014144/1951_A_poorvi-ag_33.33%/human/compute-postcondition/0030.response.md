The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `results` list, which now includes an additional `'no'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `results` is a list that originally contained either ['no'] or ['yes'], and now contains one more 'no'; `i` is incremented by 1.**
