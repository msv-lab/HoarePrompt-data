Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user and contains an even number of occurrences of the character '1'; `results` is a list containing the single element 'yes'.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that the string `'yes'` is appended to the `results` list, which was initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
