To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and what it does with the variables.

The loop iterates over `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)`. In each iteration, it updates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The variable `T` is incremented by 1 each time the outer loop (not shown in the provided code snippet) runs, but since `T` is not part of the loop's body, its value doesn't change within this specific loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `ans` is initialized to `n`.
- `T` is incremented by 1 (though `T` is not affected by the loop's body).

After the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `ans` will be the sum of the initial `n` and the series of terms `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are input integers, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `T` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `ans` is updated to be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the integer division results of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`, and `T` has been incremented by 1 from its initial value.
