### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotations:
Annotations suggest that `ans` is calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))` for each pair of `n` and `m`.

#### Issues Identified in Original Assessment:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to assume that for each test case, there are initially `n` valid pairs, which is not necessarily true based on the problem description.
2. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`. This misses the case where `b = 1`, which should also be considered.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not directly checked in the loop. Instead, the program uses `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
Let's analyze the logic behind the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`:
- For each `b`, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` counts how many multiples of `b * b` exist in the range `[b, n + b]`.
- This approach implicitly assumes that for each `b`, every `a` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is counted correctly, but this is not the case.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the test case `n = 2`, `m = 2`:
- Valid pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`
- Program output: `2`
- Expected output: `3`

The program fails to count the pair `(1, 1)` correctly because it initializes `ans` to `n` and does not include the case `b = 1` in the loop.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize `ans` to `0`.
2. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from `1` to `min(n, m)`.
3. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from `1` to `n` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly count all valid pairs due to the issues identified. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
