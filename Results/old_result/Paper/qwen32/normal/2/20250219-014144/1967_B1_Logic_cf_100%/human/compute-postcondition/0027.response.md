The code snippet provided reads two values from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The variables `t`, `ans`, and `T` are mentioned in the initial state but are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are the integer values read from the input, `ans` is the previously calculated value and needs recalculating, `T` is incremented by 1.**
This means that `n` and `m` have been updated to be integers, while `t`, `ans`, and `T` retain their previous states with `T` having been incremented by 1.
