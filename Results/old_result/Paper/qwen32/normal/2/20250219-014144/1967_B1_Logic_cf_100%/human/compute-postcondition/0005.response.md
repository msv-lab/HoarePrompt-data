To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

The loop will iterate over the range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (2) must be less than or equal to the ending value (`min(n, m) + 1`). This implies that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **`n` and `m`**: The minimum of `n` and `m` must be at least 2. This ensures that the range `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` is non-empty.
2. **`b`**: The variable `b` is initialized to 2 at the start of the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `b` before the loop starts.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that either `n` or `m` (or both) is at least 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (no change needed here).
- `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`.
- `ans` is equal to `n` (no change needed here).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2, `ans` is equal to `n`**
