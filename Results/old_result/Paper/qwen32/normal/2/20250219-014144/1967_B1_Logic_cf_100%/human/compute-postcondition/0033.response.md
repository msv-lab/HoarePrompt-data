The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. The loop iterates as long as `b` is in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

At the end of the last iteration, `b` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented to the next integer value within the specified range.

Given that `b` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `b` should be the current value of `b` plus 1, provided it is still within the range `[2, min(n, m)]`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is incremented by 1**
Since `b` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `b` at the start of the next iteration would be `b + 1`.
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is `b + 1`**

However, we need to ensure that `b + 1` does not exceed `min(n, m)`. Since we don't have the exact values of `n` and `m`, we express the state in terms of the condition that `b + 1` must be less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is `b + 1` and `b + 1 <= min(n, m)`**
