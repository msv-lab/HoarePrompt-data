To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and when it terminates.

The loop iterates over `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)`. In each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The loop continues until `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`.

Given the initial state and the way the loop updates `ans`, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are input integers.
- `ans` will be the sum of its initial value (`n`) plus the contributions from each iteration of the loop.
- `T` is incremented by 1 once, regardless of the number of iterations of the loop.

The final value of `ans` can be described as:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor \]

Here, \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which rounds down `x` to the nearest integer.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `T` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, `ans` is the initial value `n` plus the sum of the integer division results of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged except for `ans` and `T` is incremented by 1.
