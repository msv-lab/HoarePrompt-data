The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `mexsize`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`) are modified by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is 1.**
