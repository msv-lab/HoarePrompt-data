You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:

for _ in range(tc):

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. For each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x; `ans` is the largest value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions for all divisors `i` of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest value of i or x // i for all divisors i of x up to isqrt(x))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`, and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the corresponding quotient `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
- The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.
- For each test case, we need to output the maximum balance (GCD) achievable.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` can be less than or equal to either `x // i` or `i`. If so, it updates the maximum balance (`ans`) to the larger of the current `ans` and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

### Key Points:
1. **Divisors Check**: The program checks divisors up to the square root of `x`. This ensures that it considers both small and large divisors efficiently.
2. **Feasibility Check**: It checks if `n` can be less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`. This ensures that the number of sub-problems does not exceed the total difficulty divided by the chosen difficulty level.
3. **Maximizing GCD**: By updating `ans` with the maximum feasible divisor, it aims to maximize the GCD.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Small Values**: When `x` and `n` are small, the program correctly identifies the maximum GCD.
- **Large Values**: When `x` is large, the program efficiently checks divisors up to the square root of `x`.
- **Equal `x` and `n`**: When `x` equals `n`, the program correctly identifies that the GCD is 1 (since each sub-problem would have a difficulty of 1).

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles cases where `x` is small and `n` is large by checking both `x // i` and `i`. However, we need to ensure that it works for all edge cases, including when `x` is a prime number or when `n` is close to `x`.

### Testing with Edge Cases:
Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program works correctly:

1. **Prime Number**: `x = 7`, `n = 2`. The program should output `1` because the only way to split 7 into 2 parts is `1 + 6` or `2 + 5` or `3 + 4`, and the GCD is 1.
2. **Perfect Square**: `x = 9`, `n = 3`. The program should output `3` because splitting 9 into 3 parts of difficulty 3 each gives a GCD of 3.
3. **Large `x` and Small `n`**: `x = 100000000`, `n = 1`. The program should output `100000000` because the only sub-problem has difficulty `100000000`.
4. **Large `x` and Large `n`**: `x = 100000000`, `n = 100000000`. The program should output `1` because each sub-problem would have difficulty `1`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with various edge cases, it appears to handle all scenarios correctly. The program efficiently finds the maximum GCD by considering all feasible divisors and ensuring that the number of sub-problems does not exceed the total difficulty divided by the chosen difficulty level.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
