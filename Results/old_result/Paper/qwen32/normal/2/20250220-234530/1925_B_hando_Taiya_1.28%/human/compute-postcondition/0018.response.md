To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\)
- `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`)
- If `x` is divisible by `i` (`x % i == 0`), `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`
- If `n` is greater than `x // i` but less than or equal to `i`, `ans` remains the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`, the only variable that needs adjustment at the start of the next iteration is `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current Value of `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
2. **Next Iteration:** For the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer in the sequence.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` incremented by 1 from its current value.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is simply `i + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // (previous i)`; `i` is the previous `i + 1`**.
