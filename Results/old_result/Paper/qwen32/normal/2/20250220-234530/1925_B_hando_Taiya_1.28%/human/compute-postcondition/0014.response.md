Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
