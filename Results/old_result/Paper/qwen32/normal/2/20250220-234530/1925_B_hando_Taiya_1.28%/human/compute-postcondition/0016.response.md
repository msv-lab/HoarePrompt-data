Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `n` is greater than `x // i` but less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**
