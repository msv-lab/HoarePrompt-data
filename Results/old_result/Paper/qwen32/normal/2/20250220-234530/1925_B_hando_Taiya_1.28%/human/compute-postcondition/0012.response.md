To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit range limit `isqrt(x) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\)
- `ans` is either `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`
- If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `n` is updated to a value less than or equal to `i`
- `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`)

The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
1. **Increment `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
2. **Check the range condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`. We don't need to adjust `x` or `isqrt(x)` because they are constants for the duration of the loop.

No other variables in the loop head need adjustment.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is either `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is incremented by 1; `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`)**

To be more precise, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is either `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is 4; `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`)**

Generalizing this, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is either `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`)**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is either `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`)**
