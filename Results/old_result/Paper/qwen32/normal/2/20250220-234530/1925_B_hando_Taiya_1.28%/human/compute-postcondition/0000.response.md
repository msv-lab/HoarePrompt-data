The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers with specific constraints.

After executing the code, `x` and `n` will be assigned the values read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.**
