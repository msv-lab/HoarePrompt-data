The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the given signature, but based on the context, it seems to process multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers, `x` and `n`. The constraints specify that there are `t` test cases, with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10³`, and for each test case, `1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`.

Given the output description is missing, I will assume a generic functionality often associated with such inputs, which could involve computations or checks related to `x` and `n` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ x`. Based on these inputs, the function performs some computation or check and returns a result for each test case.**
