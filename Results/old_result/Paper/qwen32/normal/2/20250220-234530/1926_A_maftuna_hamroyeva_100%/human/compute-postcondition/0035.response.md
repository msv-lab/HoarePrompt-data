The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over each character in the string `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect the next character in the string `a`.

Given that `i` is 1 and does not appear to be part of the loop head, it should remain unchanged. Similarly, `t`, `a`, `l`, and `h` are not part of the loop head and should also remain unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the first character of the string `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should now be the second character of the string `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the second character of `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
