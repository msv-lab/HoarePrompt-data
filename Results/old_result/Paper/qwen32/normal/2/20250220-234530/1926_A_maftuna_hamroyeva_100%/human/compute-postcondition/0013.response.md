The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is 0 if `j` is not 'A', and 1 if `j` is 'A'. After incrementing, if `j` was not 'A', `h` becomes 1, and if `j` was 'A', `h` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 0; `a` is a non-empty string with at least two characters; `j` is the second character of `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 2; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
