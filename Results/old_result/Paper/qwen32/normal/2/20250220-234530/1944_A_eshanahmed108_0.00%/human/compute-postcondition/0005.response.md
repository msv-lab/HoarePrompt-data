Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable `t` does not affect the print statement directly, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator in Python). The expression evaluates whether `n - k <= 1`. If this condition is true, it prints `n`; otherwise, it prints `1`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `n - k <= 1` is True:**
   - This means that the difference between `n` and `k` is either 0 or 1.
   - In this case, the print statement will output the value of `n`.

2. **If `n - k <= 1` is False:**
   - This means that the difference between `n` and `k` is greater than 1.
   - In this case, the print statement will output `1`.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, the output depends on the values of `n` and `k`. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the condition.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
