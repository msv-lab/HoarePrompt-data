To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each pair of integers \( n \) and \( k \). The loop reads \( t \) pairs of integers, where each pair consists of \( n \) and \( k \). For each pair, it prints \( n \) if \( n - k \leq 1 \), otherwise, it prints 1.

Since the loop iterates exactly \( t \) times, the final output state will consist of \( t \) printed values, each determined by the condition \( n - k \leq 1 \).

Let's break down the process:

1. The loop runs \( t \) times, where \( t \) is the number of test cases.
2. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers \( n \) and \( k \).
3. It checks the condition \( n - k \leq 1 \):
   - If true, it prints \( n \).
   - If false, it prints 1.

After all iterations, the output will be a sequence of \( t \) numbers, each either \( n \) or 1 based on the condition for each pair.

Given the format requirement, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **a sequence of t numbers, where each number is either n or 1, depending on whether the condition n - k <= 1 is true or false for each respective pair of n and k read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is a list of \( t \) values, each value being either \( n \) or 1, determined by the condition evaluated for each pair of \( n \) and \( k \) provided in the input.
