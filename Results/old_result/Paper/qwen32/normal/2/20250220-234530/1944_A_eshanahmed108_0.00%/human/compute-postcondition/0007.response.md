The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, but `n` and `k` are not defined before this line of code. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
