You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: a sequence of t numbers, where each number is either n or 1, depending on whether the condition n - k <= 1 is true or false for each respective pair of n and k read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints `1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - There are `n` islands, initially fully connected by bridges.
   - Total number of bridges is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Objective**:
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - If Dominater destroys enough bridges such that island 1 is disconnected from all other islands, then Everule can only visit island 1.
   - To disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Dominater needs to destroy \(n-1\) bridges (one to each of the other islands).

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If `k >= n-1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, leaving Everule with only island 1.
   - If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can still visit some subset of the islands.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program implements the following logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

- **Logic Breakdown**:
  - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
  - It checks if `n - k <= 1`.
    - If true, it prints `n`. This condition implies that after destroying `k` bridges, island 1 can still reach at least one other island, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.
    - If false, it prints `1`. This condition implies that after destroying `k` bridges, island 1 is disconnected from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n=2`, `k=0`
   - `n - k = 2 - 0 = 2 > 1`
   - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n=2`, `k=1`
   - `n - k = 2 - 1 = 1 <= 1`
   - Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be `1`)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n=4`, `k=1`
   - `n - k = 4 - 1 = 3 > 1`
   - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `4`)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n=5`, `k=10`
   - `n - k = 5 - 10 = -5 <= 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `n=5`, `k=3`
   - `n - k = 5 - 3 = 2 > 1`
   - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `5`)

6. **Test Case 6**: `n=4`, `k=4`
   - `n - k = 4 - 4 = 0 <= 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The condition `n - k <= 1` is incorrectly used to determine when Everule can visit all islands. Instead, the correct condition should be `k < n-1` to determine when island 1 can still reach other islands.

**Correctness: False**
