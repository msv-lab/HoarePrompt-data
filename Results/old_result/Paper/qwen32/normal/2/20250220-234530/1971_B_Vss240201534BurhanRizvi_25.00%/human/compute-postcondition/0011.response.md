Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the user's input, `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in the original `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The value of `s` remains the user's input. The value of `s2` is updated to be a random permutation of the characters in the original `s`.
