Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the new user's input.
- `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in the original `s`.

The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print(s2)` statement.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `s`:**
   - `s` represents the user's input, which is a string. The exact content of this string is not specified in the precondition, so it can be any valid string input by the user.

2. **Variable `s2`:**
   - `s2` is described as a random permutation of the characters in the original string `s`. This means that `s2` will contain all the same characters as `s`, but their order will be randomized.

### What Will Be Printed:

When the `print(s2)` statement is executed, it will output the string `s2`, which is a random permutation of the characters in the original string `s`.

Since the exact content of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact sequence of characters in `s2`. However, we know that `s2` will be a rearrangement of the characters in `s`.

### Final Output:

Output: **s2 (where s2 is a random permutation of the characters in the original string s)**
