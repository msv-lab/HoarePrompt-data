The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `s`, and `s2`. Specifically:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `s` is the user's input, which is a string.
- `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in the string `s`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
