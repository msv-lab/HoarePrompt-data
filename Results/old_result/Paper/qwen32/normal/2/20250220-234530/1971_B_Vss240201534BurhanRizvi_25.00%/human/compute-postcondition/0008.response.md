Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is equal to the string representation of `t`, `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s` remains the string representation of `t` and `s2` is a different permutation of the characters in `s`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `s2`.**
