Let's analyze the given task step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the user's input.
- `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in the original `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'Yes'`. This output does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. The variables `t`, `s`, and `s2` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'Yes'`, the output will always be `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
