`s` is assigned the value of the input, which must be equal to `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is equal to the string representation of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is equal to the string representation of `t`.**
