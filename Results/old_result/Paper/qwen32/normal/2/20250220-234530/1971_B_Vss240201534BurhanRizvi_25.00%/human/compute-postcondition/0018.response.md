The code snippet provided generates a new random permutation of the characters in the string `s` and assigns it to `s2`. The value of `t` and the original `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new user's input, `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in the original `s`.**
