Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it is "AM" or "PM" is flawed. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. When `h` is 0, the program correctly sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
2. When `h` is greater than 12, the program correctly converts `h` to 12-hour format and sets `day` to 'PM'.
3. However, when `h` is between 1 and 11, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' and then checks if `h` is 12 (which it never will be in this range). This part of the code is redundant and incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

In this corrected version, the logic is simplified and correctly handles all cases:
- If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM'.
