Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is fine because we need to set a default value, but it might not always be accurate before the first condition check.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `n` is read correctly using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, the input string `s` of format `hh:mm` is split into hours `h` and minutes `m` using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - **Case 1: Hour is 0 (`h == 0`)**:
     - The hour is set to `12` and `day` is set to `'AM'`. This is correct because `00:xx` in 24-hour format corresponds to `12:xx AM` in 12-hour format.
   - **Case 2: Hour is greater than 12 (`h > 12`)**:
     - The hour is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to `'PM'`. This is correct because any hour greater than 12 in 24-hour format corresponds to `h-12` in the PM part of the 12-hour format.
   - **Case 3: Hour is between 1 and 12 (`1 <= h <= 12`)**:
     - The `day` is set to `'AM'` initially. However, if `h` is `12`, it should be set to `'PM'` instead. This part of the logic is correct but the order of conditions needs adjustment to ensure `h=12` is handled properly.

4. **Output**:
   - The formatted string `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}'` is printed. This ensures that the hours and minutes are always displayed with two digits, and the correct period (`AM` or `PM`) is appended.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling `h == 12` is placed after setting `day = 'AM'`. This means that when `h == 12`, `day` will incorrectly be set to `'AM'` before being corrected to `'PM'`. To fix this, the condition for `h == 12` should be checked before setting `day = 'AM'`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has a logical error in the order of conditions, specifically with how `h == 12` is handled. Once corrected, the program would work as expected.

Therefore, the original program is **incorrect** due to the mentioned issue.

Correctness: **False**
