Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, and `m` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12, `day` is set to 'PM', and `h` is now between 1 and 12. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.**
