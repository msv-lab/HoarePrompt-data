The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `b` to the list `l`. 

Given the initial state, `l` was previously determined based on certain conditions involving `b`. After executing the line `l.append(b[i])`, the list `l` now includes the element `b[i]` at its end.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans2` is `[]`, and `l` is the previous `l` with `b[i]` appended to it.**
