The given code snippet appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. This means that the list `ans1` will now contain one additional element, which is `b[i]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `q` remains 1.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 2.
- `a` remains the newly read list of integers from the input.
- `b` remains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order.
- `c` remains the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order.
- `req` remains twice the second integer read from the input.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `ans2` remains `[]`.
- `l` remains determined based on conditions involving `b`.
- `ans1` now contains `b[i]` appended to its previous contents.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans2` is `[]`, `l` is determined based on conditions involving `b`, `ans1` contains its previous contents plus `b[i]`.**
