Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input (or `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 2 if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`), `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` is an empty list (or a list containing the last element of `b` twice if `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, and `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. Additionally, if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b`. If `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` contains the last element of `b` twice.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, and `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. Additionally, if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2 if `k` was initially 0, otherwise `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 4, and `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` four times (with the fourth element being `b[i]`). If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged unless it is 0, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` includes `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, and `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. Additionally, if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2 if `k` was initially 0, otherwise `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 4, and `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` four times (with the fourth element being `b[i]`) plus the newly appended `b[i]`. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged unless it is 0, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` includes `b[i]`. `i` is `x + 1`. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` now includes `b[i]`. If `k` was initially 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `k` is decreased by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]` and the last element of `b` if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` includes the element `b[i]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` also contains `b[i]`. `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
