You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then outputs two lists of integers, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `k` integers selected from the first `n` and the last `n` integers of the list `a`, respectively, following specific rules to ensure that pairs of equal integers are included when possible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` will be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r` for all possible inputs. Let's analyze the logic and identify potential issues:

1. **Initialization and Sorting**: The program initializes two lists `b` and `c` which are the first half and second half of the input array `a`, respectively. Both `b` and `c` are sorted.

2. **Selection of Elements**:
   - The program attempts to select elements from `b` and `c` to form `ans1` and `ans2` such that their lengths are `2k`.
   - It first tries to handle unique elements at the boundaries of `b` and `c`.
   - It then iterates through the sorted lists to find pairs of identical elements and adds them to `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - Finally, it tries to balance the remaining elements between `ans1` and `ans2` using the list `l`.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for selecting elements does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal. The program does not explicitly compute the XOR values and ensure they match.
   - The program does not handle all possible cases of element distribution between `b` and `c`. For example, if the elements are distributed in a way that makes it impossible to balance the XOR values, the program might fail to produce a valid solution.

Let's consider a specific counterexample:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
Two arrays `l` and `r` of length 4 such that their bitwise XORs are equal. One possible solution could be:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program might output something like:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
However, the internal logic might not guarantee this for all distributions of elements. For instance, if the elements are distributed differently, the program might not handle it correctly.

To ensure correctness, the program should explicitly compute the XOR values of the selected elements and verify that they match. The current implementation does not do this, making it potentially incorrect for certain inputs.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all possible inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
