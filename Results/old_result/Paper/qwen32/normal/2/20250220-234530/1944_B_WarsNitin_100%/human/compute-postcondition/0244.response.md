The given code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, and `b` is a sorted list of integers.

After executing the line `ans1.append(b[i])`, the list `ans1` will now include the element `b[4]`.

No other variables are modified by this single line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is 4, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `b[i]` and `b[n-2]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is updated to include `b[i]` and `k` is adjusted by subtracting 2. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` remains as defined in the else part, and if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`, `l` includes `b[3]`. `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]` and `b[i] != b[i-1]`, then `l` also includes `b[i]`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `ans1` includes `b[4]`.**
