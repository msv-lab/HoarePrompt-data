Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `q`: Fixed at 2.
- `n`: An integer greater than 2.
- `a`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `b`: The first `n` elements of `a`, sorted in ascending order.
- `c`: The sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order.
- `ans1`: Contains all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0 plus the first three elements of `l`.
- `req`: Twice the second integer read from the input.
- `i`: Fixed at 2.
- `ans2`: Contains all pairs of consecutive equal elements found in `c` until `k` reaches 0 plus the first three elements of `l`.
- `k`: Fixed at -3.
- `l`: Contains at least one unique element from `b` that is not part of any pair.

### Key Points:

- `k` is initialized to -3, which means it will never reach 0 since it starts negative and only decreases.
- `ans2` is supposed to contain pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` reaches 0. Since `k` is always negative, no pairs will be added to `ans2` due to the condition.
- `ans2` also includes the first three elements of `l`. Since `l` contains at least one unique element from `b`, `ans2` will include the first three elements of `l`.

### Conclusion:

Given that `k` is -3 and will never reach 0, `ans2` will only contain the first three elements of `l`. Since the exact contents of `l` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `l`.

### Final Output:

Output: **the first three elements of l (where l contains at least one unique element from b that is not part of any pair)**
