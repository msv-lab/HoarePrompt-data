Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is 3, `ans2` is `[]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the fourth smallest element of `b` and the fifth smallest element of `b`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `l` contains the fourth smallest element of `b`. If `k == 0` in either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
