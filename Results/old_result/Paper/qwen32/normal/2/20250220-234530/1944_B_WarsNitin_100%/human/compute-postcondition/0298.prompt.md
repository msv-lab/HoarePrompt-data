Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, plus up to `min(k_initial, len(l))` elements from `l`, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, and `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop ends, plus up to `min(k_initial, len(l))` elements from `l`. `k` is 0 if the loop completes because `k` was decremented to 0, otherwise `k` is `k_initial - len(l)` if all elements of `l` were processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 and additionally contains elements from `l` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 and additionally contains elements from `l` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of any pair of consecutive equal elements and are not equal to their next element. `k` is 0 if the loop broke due to `k` reaching 0, otherwise it is the remaining value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0 plus the first three elements of `l`, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is `2`, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive equal elements found in `c` until `k` reaches 0 plus the first three elements of `l`, `k` is -3, and `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` that is not part of any pair.`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
