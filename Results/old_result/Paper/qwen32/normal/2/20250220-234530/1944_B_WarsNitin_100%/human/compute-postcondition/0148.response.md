The code snippet `k -= 2` decrements the value of `k` by 2. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `k`. The new value of `k` will be its original value minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is 3, `ans2` is `[]`, `ans1` contains the fourth smallest element of `b` and the fifth smallest element of `b`. If `k == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. `k` is decreased by 2.**
