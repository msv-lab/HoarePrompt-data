The code snippet provided is `k -= 2`. This operation decreases the value of `k` by 2.

Given the initial state, `k` is initially 0. After executing `k -= 2`, the new value of `k` will be `-2`.

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` is a list containing two equal elements `c[i]`, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not the first or last element if they are not equal to their adjacent elements, and `k` is -2. Additionally, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**
