To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `temp` and `i`. The loop continues to double `temp` as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`. Once `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, the loop breaks.

Let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `temp` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, if `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is doubled (`temp *= 2`) and `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).
   - The loop stops when `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

The final values of `temp` and `i` will be such that `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`, and `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled.

### Final Output State
- `t`: Remains unchanged.
- `l1`: Remains unchanged.
- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `k`: Remains unchanged.
- `arr`: Remains unchanged.
- `k0`: Remains unchanged.
- `ans`: Remains unchanged.
- `temp`: The largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- `i`: The number of times `temp` was doubled to reach its final value.

### Example Calculation
Suppose `k = 10`:
- Iteration 1: `temp = 1 * 2 = 2`, `i = 0 + 1 = 1`
- Iteration 2: `temp = 2 * 2 = 4`, `i = 1 + 1 = 2`
- Iteration 3: `temp = 4 * 2 = 8`, `i = 2 + 1 = 3`
- Iteration 4: `temp = 8 * 2 = 16`, but since `16` is not less than `10`, the loop breaks.

Thus, the final values are `temp = 8` and `i = 3`.

### General Case
For any `k`, the final `temp` will be the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `i` will be the exponent of that power of 2.

### Conclusion
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled to reach its final value.**
