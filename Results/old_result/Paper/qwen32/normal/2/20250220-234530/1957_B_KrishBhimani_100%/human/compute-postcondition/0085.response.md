The `break` statement does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not. Specifically, if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 2 and `i` is 1; otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0.**
