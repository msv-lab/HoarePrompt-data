To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\), `k - (2^i - 1)`, and `n - 2` zeros.
   - `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).

2. **Calculations**:
   - `i` is determined by finding the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\). This means \(2^{i+1} \geq k\).
   - `temp` is \(2^i\), the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - The list `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - The first element is \(2^i - 1\).
     - The second element is `k - (2^i - 1)`.
     - The remaining `n - 2` elements are zeros.

3. **Explanation of `ans`**:
   - The first element of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\), where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
   - The second element of `ans` is `k - (2^i - 1)`, which is the remainder after subtracting \(2^i - 1\) from `k`.
   - The next `n - 2` elements are all zeros.

Given these details, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

**Output**:
- The first element is \(2^i - 1\).
- The second element is `k - (2^i - 1)`.
- The next `n - 2` elements are zeros.

Thus, the output will be a sequence starting with \(2^i - 1\), followed by `k - (2^i - 1)`, and then `n - 2` zeros.

Output: **\(2^i - 1\), \(k - (2^i - 1)\), 0, 0, ..., 0 (where \(i\) is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and there are \(n - 2\) zeros)**
