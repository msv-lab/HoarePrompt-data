You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it computes and prints a list of `n` integers. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence starting with the largest power of 2 less than `k`, followed by the remainder when `k` is subtracted by the sum of the sequence, and fills the rest of the list with zeros to ensure the list has `n` elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
- The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of integers) and `k` (the sum).

2. **Handling Single Element Case (`n == 1`):**
   - If `n == 1`, the only possible sequence is `[k]`. This is correct because there's no other way to distribute `k` across more than one element.

3. **Handling Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`):**
   - The program initializes an empty array `arr` and sets `k0` to `k`.
   - It then enters a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - Once found, it appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the answer array `ans`. This value is the largest number with `i+1` bits set to 1.
   - It then appends the remaining sum `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it pads the array with zeros until it reaches the required length `n`.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
  - The program attempts to maximize the number of 1s by using the largest possible number with a certain number of bits set to 1, but it doesn't ensure that this approach will always yield the optimal solution.
  - For example, consider the test case `n=3, k=7`. The program might output something like `[7, 0, 0]` or `[3, 4, 0]`, but a better solution would be `[3, 3, 1]` which gives `3 | 3 | 1 = 7` (binary `111`) with three 1s.
  - The program does not explore other combinations that could potentially have more 1s in the bitwise OR result.

- **General Approach:**
  - A better strategy would involve distributing `k` in such a way that the resulting bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s. This typically involves setting as many lower bits as possible to 1 across different numbers.

### Conclusion:
The current program does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem requirements.
