In this case, the `while` loop is specified as `while True:`, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body (which is omitted here). Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Given that the loop condition is always true, the state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated without any changes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 1, 2, or 4; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2. Specifically, if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 2 and `i` is 1; otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0. If `temp * 2` is not less than `k` and `temp` was initially 2, then `temp` becomes 4 and `i` becomes 2.**
