Given the initial state, the code snippet `temp *= 2` will double the value of `temp`. 

If `temp` was initially 1, it will become 2. If `temp` was initially 2, it will become 4.

Since `temp` determines the value of `i` based on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`, after doubling `temp`, `i` will be updated accordingly. If `temp` was 1 and became 2, `i` will be set to 1 if `2 * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` will remain 0. If `temp` was 2 and became 4, `i` will be set to 1 if `4 * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` will remain 0.

However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only express the new value of `temp` and the condition for `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2 or 4; `i` is 1 if `temp * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` is 0.**
