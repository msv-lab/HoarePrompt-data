Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` was less than `k` initially, then `temp` is set to 4 and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0.**
