Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 1, 2, or 4; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2. Specifically, if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is 2 and `i` is 1; otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0. If `temp * 2` is not less than `k` and `temp` was initially 2, then `temp` becomes 4 and `i` becomes 2.**
