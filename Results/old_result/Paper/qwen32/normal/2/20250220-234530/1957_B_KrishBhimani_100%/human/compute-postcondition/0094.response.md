The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`.

Let's denote the initial value of `ans[0]` as `a0`, which is `(1 << i) - 1`. After appending `k - sum(ans)`, the new element in `ans` will be `k - a0`.

So, the updated `ans` list will contain two elements: `[a0, k - a0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled to reach its final value.**
