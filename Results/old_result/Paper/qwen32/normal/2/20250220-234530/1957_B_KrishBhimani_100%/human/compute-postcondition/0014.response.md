Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 1; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 2 (or `temp` is doubled from its initial value).**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
