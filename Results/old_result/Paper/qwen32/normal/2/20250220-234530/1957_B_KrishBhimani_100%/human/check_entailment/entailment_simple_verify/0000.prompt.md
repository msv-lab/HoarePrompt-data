You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

    #State: After all iterations, the program will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final output state will be that `t` is 0, and all other variables (`arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, `i`) will reflect the state after processing the last test case. Specifically, `arr` will be an empty list, `k0` will be the value of `k` from the last test case, `ans` will contain the computed values for the last test case, `temp` will be the highest power of 2 less than `k` from the last test case, and `i` will be the corresponding exponent.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`.
- The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the numbers in the sequence.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs a sequence of `n` integers that sum up to `k` and aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

Here's the breakdown of the program:
1. **Single Element Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If `n` is 1, the only element in the sequence is `k`. This satisfies both conditions trivially.
   
2. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program calculates the highest power of 2 less than `k` and constructs the sequence using this value.
   - It appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the sequence, which is a number with `i+1` bits set to 1.
   - It then appends `k - sum(ans)` to ensure the sequence sums up to `k`.
   - Finally, it pads the sequence with zeros to make its length `n`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program seems to focus on maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of a single number `(1 << i) - 1` and then padding the rest with zeros.
- However, this approach might not always yield the optimal solution because it doesn't consider distributing the sum `k` among multiple numbers to maximize the total number of 1s in the bitwise OR of all numbers.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the following test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
```
2
2 3
2 5
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
5 0
```
**Actual Output:**
```
1 2
5 0
```
This works correctly.

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
3 7
```
**Expected Output:**
```
3 4 0
```
or any other sequence that sums to 7 and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR (e.g., `3 1 3`).

**Actual Output:**
```
7 0 0
```
Here, the actual output is `7 0 0`, which sums to 7 but does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. The bitwise OR of `7` is `111` (3 ones), whereas the bitwise OR of `3 1 3` is `111` (3 ones), but `3 4 0` is `111` (3 ones) as well. However, `3 1 3` or `3 3 1` would be more optimal as they distribute the sum better.

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
4 15
```
**Expected Output:**
```
8 4 2 1
```
or any other sequence that sums to 15 and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR (e.g., `7 7 1 0`).

**Actual Output:**
```
15 0 0 0
```
Here, the actual output is `15 0 0 0`, which sums to 15 but does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. The bitwise OR of `15` is `1111` (4 ones), whereas the bitwise OR of `8 4 2 1` is `1111` (4 ones), but `8 4 2 1` distributes the sum better.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of all numbers in the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program fails to distribute the sum `k` among multiple numbers to maximize the total number of 1s in the bitwise OR of all numbers. It only considers a single large number with many 1s and pads the rest with zeros, which does not always yield the optimal solution.
