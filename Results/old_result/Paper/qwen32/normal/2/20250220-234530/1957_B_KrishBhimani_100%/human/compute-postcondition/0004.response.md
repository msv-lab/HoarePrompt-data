Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 10,000, but its exact value is not specified.
- `l1` is a list of strings. This list contains at least two elements since `n` and `k` are derived from the first and second elements respectively.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and it is explicitly stated that `n` equals 1.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet contains only one line:
```python
print(k)
```
This line will print the value of `k`.

### Determining the Value of `k`:
From the initial state, we know that `k` is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`. Since the exact contents of `l1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know that `k` is an integer derived from the second element of `l1`.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the output will be the value of `k`, which is an integer derived from the second element of the list `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`)**
