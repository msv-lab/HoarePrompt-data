The given code appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements, the number of zeros appended is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \(2^i - 1\), \(k - (2^i - 1)\), and possibly additional zeros to make its length `n`; `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `i` is the exponent of this power of 2.**
