Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice, `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed and then the element `x` added.**

Natural Language Explanation: The last element of `bigList` was removed, which means that the element `x` that was just added is now also removed. `smallList` remains unchanged from its initial state, which had its last element removed and then `x` added.
