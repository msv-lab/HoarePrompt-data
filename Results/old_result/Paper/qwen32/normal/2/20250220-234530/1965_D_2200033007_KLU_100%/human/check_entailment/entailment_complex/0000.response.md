### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Problem Understanding:
We need to reconstruct a palindrome array `a` of size `n` from a list of subarray sums, where one subarray sum is missing. The goal is to identify the missing sum and use it to construct the palindrome array.

#### Analysis of Provided Functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Generate all subarray sums of a given list `a` and return them sorted.
   - **Implementation**: Iterates through the list to calculate cumulative sums from each index to the end, stores these sums in `cts`, and sorts `cts` before returning.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly computes all subarray sums and sorts them.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Remove consecutive duplicates from a list `cts`.
   - **Implementation**: Iterates through `cts` and appends elements to `odds` unless the current element is the same as the last element in `odds`, in which case it removes the last element from `odds`.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly removes consecutive duplicates, which is useful for identifying unique subarray sums.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from a list of unique subarray sums `odds`.
   - **Implementation**: Initializes an array `a` of zeros, iterates through `odds`, and assigns values to `a` based on the differences between consecutive elements in `odds`. The logic seems intended to fill the array symmetrically.
   - **Correctness**: The implementation logic appears flawed. The example state provided (`a = [2, -2, 5, -2, 0]`) indicates incorrect behavior since negative numbers and incorrect values do not form a valid palindrome. The function should ensure that all elements are positive and the array is symmetric.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Identify the missing subarray sum by comparing `bigList` and `smallList`.
   - **Implementation**: Removes matching elements from the end of `bigList` that are present in `smallList` and returns the last element of `bigList`.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly identifies the last differing element, which is used to find the missing sum.

#### Overall Program Flow:
- The program reads test cases, processes each test case to find the missing subarray sum, and attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array using the identified sums.
- The main issue lies in `func_3`, which does not correctly reconstruct the palindrome array due to incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation in `func_3`, which does not properly reconstruct the palindrome array.

**Correctness: False**
