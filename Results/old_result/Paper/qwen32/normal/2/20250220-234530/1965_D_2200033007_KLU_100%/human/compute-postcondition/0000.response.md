To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, let's analyze the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **`len(smallList) > 0`**: This condition requires that `smallList` has at least one element.
2. **`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**: This condition requires that the last element of `bigList` matches the last element of `smallList`.

### Current State:
- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- The elements in `smallList` are a subset of the elements at the end of `bigList` in the same order.

### Necessary Adjustments:
1. **Ensure `smallList` has at least one element**: If `smallList` is empty, the loop cannot execute. Therefore, `smallList` must contain at least one element.
2. **Ensure the last elements match**: The last element of `bigList` should be equal to the last element of `smallList`. Given that `smallList` is a subset of `bigList` at the end, this condition should naturally hold true if `smallList` is non-empty and correctly aligned with the end of `bigList`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed, we need to make sure `smallList` contains at least one element. No further adjustments are necessary because the problem statement already guarantees that the elements in `smallList` are a subset of the elements at the end of `bigList` in the same order.

### Final State:
State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `smallList` must have at least one element, and the elements in `smallList` are a subset of the elements at the end of `bigList` in the same order.**
