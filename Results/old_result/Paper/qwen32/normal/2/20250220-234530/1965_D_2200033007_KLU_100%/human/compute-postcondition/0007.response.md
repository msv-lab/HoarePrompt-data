The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Given the initial condition that `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, the last element of `bigList` (which is also the last element of `smallList`) is removed. This means `bigList` will now have one less element than before, and `smallList` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bigList` has its last element removed, making its length one less than before; `smallList` remains unchanged and still has its last element.**
