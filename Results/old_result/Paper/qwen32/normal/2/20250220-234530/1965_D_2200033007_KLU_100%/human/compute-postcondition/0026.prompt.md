Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a`; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` zeros; `prev` is 0; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for x in odds:
    if idx == n - 1 - idx:
        a[idx] = x
    else:
        a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
    prev = x
    idx = idx - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least one integer; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` zeros except `a[idx]` which is `x` if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, otherwise `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both `(x - prev) // 2`; `prev` is `x`; `idx` is `((n - 1) // 2) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least two integers; `x` is the second element in the `odds` list. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is equal to `odds[1]`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`. `prev` is now equal to `x`. `idx` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least three integers; `x` is the third element in the `odds` list. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `odds[1]`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both set to `(x - prev) // 2`. `prev` is updated to `x`, and `idx` is decreased by 1. `prev` is now equal to `x`. `idx` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
