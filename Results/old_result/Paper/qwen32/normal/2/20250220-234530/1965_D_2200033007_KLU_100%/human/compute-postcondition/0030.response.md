To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `len(a)`. The variable `i` is fixed at 2 and does not change within the loop.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `cts` is a list that contains cumulative sums starting from different points in `a`.
   - `sm` is set to `a[j]` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is 2 and remains unchanged.
   - `j` is the current index being processed in the loop.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 2.

2. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i` (which is 2) to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Adjusting for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the current index, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - `len(a)` remains unchanged as it is a property of the list `a`.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value of 2, making it 3.
- `len(a)` remains the same and must be greater than 2.

The other variables (`a`, `cts`, `sm`, `i`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement and the loop head.

State: **`a` remains the same, `cts` will be `[a[0], a[0] + a[1], a[0] + a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a), a[1], a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a) - a[0], a[j]]`, `sm` is `a[j]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 2**
