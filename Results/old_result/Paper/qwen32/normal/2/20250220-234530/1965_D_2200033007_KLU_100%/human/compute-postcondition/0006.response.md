To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `len(smallList) > 0` (the `smallList` must have at least one element).
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` (the last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice.
- `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice.

Let's analyze what needs to be done:

1. **Ensure `smallList` has at least one element**: Since `smallList` had its last element removed twice, it must have had at least two elements initially. To ensure it still has at least one element, we need to adjust the state such that `smallList` has at least one element remaining.

2. **Ensure the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal**: After removing the last two elements from both lists, we need to make sure that the new last elements of both lists are equal.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
- We need to add back at least one element to `smallList` to ensure it is not empty.
- We need to ensure that the last element of `bigList` matches the last element of `smallList`.

### Example Adjustment:
- Suppose initially, `bigList` was `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `smallList` was `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- After removing the last two elements, `bigList` becomes `[1, 2]` and `smallList` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- To ensure the loop can execute again, we can add an element to `smallList` and make sure the last elements match.

### Adjusted State:
- Let's add `3` to `smallList`, making it `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Ensure `bigList` ends with `3`, making it `[1, 2, 3]`.

However, since we don't know the exact initial values, we can generalize this as:
- `smallList` must have at least one element.
- The last element of `bigList` must match the last element of `smallList`.

Thus, the adjusted state can be described as:
State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice but now has an additional element that matches the last element of `smallList`, and `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice but now has at least one element.**

For simplicity and generality:
State: **`bigList` and `smallList` have their last elements added back such that `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.**
