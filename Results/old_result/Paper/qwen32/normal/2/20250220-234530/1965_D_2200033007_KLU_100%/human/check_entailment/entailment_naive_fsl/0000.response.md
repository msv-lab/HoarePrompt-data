To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it accurately reconstructs a palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums, excluding one sum. Let's analyze the code step-by-step and verify its correctness.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **func_1(a)**:
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and sorts them.
   - It ensures that we have all subarray sums in a sorted order, which will be useful later for comparison.

2. **func_2(cts)**:
   - This function takes the sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) and processes it to find the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - The logic here is based on the observation that if a subarray sum appears an even number of times, it can be paired up with another identical subarray sum. Only the subarray sum that is missing will appear an odd number of times.
   - The function uses a stack-like approach to remove pairs of identical sums, leaving only the odd-count sums.

3. **func_3(odds, n)**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of odd-count subarray sums (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros and fills it in a way that maintains the palindrome property.
   - The function iterates through the `odds` list, calculating the difference between consecutive sums to determine the values of the array elements.
   - The middle element of the palindrome is handled separately since it appears only once.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**:
   - This function seems to be designed to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists (`bigList` and `smallList`).
   - However, this function is not used in the main logic of reconstructing the palindrome array and appears to be redundant.

### Main Logic

The main logic involves using `func_1` to generate all subarray sums, `func_2` to filter out the odd-count sums, and `func_3` to reconstruct the palindrome array.

### Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided examples and additional test cases.

#### Example Verification

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `subarray_sums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 1]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `subarray_sums = [18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
   - Expected Output: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `subarray_sums = [5, 10, 5, 16, 3, 3, 13, 8, 8]`
   - Expected Output: `[3, 5, 5, 3]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `subarray_sums = [8, 10, 4, 6, 4, 20, 14, 14, 6]`
   - Expected Output: `[6, 4, 4, 6]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `subarray_sums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `subarray_sums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8]`
   - Expected Output: `[2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.

7. **Seventh Example**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `subarray_sums = [500000000, 1000000000, 500000000, 500000000, 1000000000]`
   - Expected Output: `[500000000, 500000000, 500000000]`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array.
