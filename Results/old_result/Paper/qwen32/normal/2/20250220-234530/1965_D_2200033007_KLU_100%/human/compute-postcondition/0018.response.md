Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least two integers; `x` is the second element in the `odds` list. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is equal to `odds[1]`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`. `prev` is now equal to `x`. `idx` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `idx` is now one less than its previous value. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
