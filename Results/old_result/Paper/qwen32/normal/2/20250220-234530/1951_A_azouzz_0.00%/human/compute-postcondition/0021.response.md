The code snippet `cnt1 = s.count('1')` updates the value of `cnt1` to the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This means that the value of `cnt1` will now reflect the count of '1's in `s`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is the integer value of the user input
- `s` is the new value of the user input
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`

After executing `cnt1 = s.count('1')`, only `cnt1` changes to the actual count of '1's in `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.**
