Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new integer value of the user input; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. Regardless of the condition `cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0`, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
