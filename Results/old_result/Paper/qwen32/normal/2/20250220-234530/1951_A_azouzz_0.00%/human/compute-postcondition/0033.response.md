Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is `t - 1` (This suggests that `t` was initially some value, but it is now one less than that value).
- `n` is the new integer value of the user input.
- `s` is the new value of the user input.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
