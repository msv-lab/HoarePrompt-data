Reasoning:  
The provided program and the execution summary do not match the problem description. The problem description specifies a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that scans directories within the current working directory, checks if their names fall within a specified numeric range, and generates specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for `.html` files found in those directories. 

However, the given program defines a function `func_1` that performs a completely different task. It reads an integer `t`, then for each of the next `t` iterations, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. It checks the number of '1's in the string `s` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of consecutive '1's in the string.

Since the provided program does not implement the functionality described in the problem statement, it is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
