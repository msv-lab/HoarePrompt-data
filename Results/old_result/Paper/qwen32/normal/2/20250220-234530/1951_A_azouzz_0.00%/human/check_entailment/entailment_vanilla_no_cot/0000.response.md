Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a function that generates specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) in subdirectories named with numbers within a specified range, based on the presence of `.html` files. However, the given program defines a function `func_1` that reads input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of '1's in a string and the presence of '11'. This has no relation to the task described in the problem statement.
