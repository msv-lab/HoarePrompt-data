The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the dictionary `hmp`. If there are more elements in `hmp` to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current key from `hmp`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next key in `hmp`.

Since the loop iterates over the keys of `hmp`, the next state should reflect that `i` is now the next key in the dictionary.

State: **`ans` is recalculated based on the next element in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains recalculated based on the next element in `hmp` without any additional adjustment. `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**
