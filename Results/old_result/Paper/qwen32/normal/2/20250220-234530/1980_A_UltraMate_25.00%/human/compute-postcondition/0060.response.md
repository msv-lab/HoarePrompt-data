To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:

The initial state provides a formula to compute `ans`:
\[ \text{ans} = 6 \times m + \sum_{i} (\text{m} - \text{hmp}[i]) \]
where the summation is over all indices \( i \) such that \( \text{hmp}[i] < \text{m} \).

### Variables Involved:
- \( m \): An integer value.
- \( \text{hmp} \): A list of integers.
- \( \text{ans} \): The result of the formula given above.

### Steps to Determine the Output:

1. **Identify the Value of \( m \)**:
   - \( m \) is an integer, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state.

2. **Identify the List \( \text{hmp} \)**:
   - \( \text{hmp} \) is a list of integers, but its specific elements are not provided in the initial state.

3. **Compute the Summation Term**:
   - The summation term is \(\sum_{i} (\text{m} - \text{hmp}[i])\) where the summation is over all indices \( i \) such that \( \text{hmp}[i] < \text{m} \).
   - This means we need to find all elements in \( \text{hmp} \) that are less than \( m \), subtract each from \( m \), and sum up these differences.

4. **Combine Terms to Compute \( \text{ans} \)**:
   - \( \text{ans} = 6 \times m + \sum_{i} (\text{m} - \text{hmp}[i]) \).

### Explanation of the Print Statement:
- The print statement `print(ans)` will output the value of \( \text{ans} \) as computed by the formula above.

### Final Output Description:
- Since the exact values of \( m \) and \( \text{hmp} \) are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of \( \text{ans} \).
- However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given formula.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as 6 * m + Î£(m - hmp[i]) for all i in hmp where hmp[i] < m)**
