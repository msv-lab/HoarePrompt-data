Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is a string input by the user; `p` is 'ABCDEF'; `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`; `i` is 'D'. If 'D' is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
