Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp` plus `m - hmp[i]`; `hmp` remains a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `i` is `next_key_next`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. The values of `hmp` and `i` remain unchanged.
