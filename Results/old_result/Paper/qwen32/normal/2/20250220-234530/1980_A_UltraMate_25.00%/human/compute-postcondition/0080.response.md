The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `m` and `hmp[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `ans` is already the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`. After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to include the additional value `m - hmp[i]`.

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`, plus `m - hmp[i]`; `hmp` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
