### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of problems and the number of rounds, respectively.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` which contains the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - A `Counter` object `hmp` is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEF'` (note that 'G' is not included here, which is intentional as per the problem statement).
     - If a difficulty level `i` from `p` is not present in `hmp` (meaning it doesn't exist in the input string), it adds `m` to `ans` because `m` new problems of that difficulty level are needed.
     - If a difficulty level `i` exists in `hmp` but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` because that many more problems of that difficulty level are needed.
   
4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed for that test case.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly identifies the need for additional problems of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'F' based on the counts in `hmp`.
- It handles the scenario where a particular difficulty level is completely missing by adding `m` to `ans`.
- It also correctly accounts for the scenario where a difficulty level is present but not enough times by adding the difference to `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It accurately calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

**Correctness:** **True**
