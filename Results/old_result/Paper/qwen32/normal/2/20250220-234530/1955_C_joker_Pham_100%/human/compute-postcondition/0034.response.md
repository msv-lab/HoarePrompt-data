Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`. The current value of `k` is 0. No changes are made to `sunks`, `l`, or `r` under this condition, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
