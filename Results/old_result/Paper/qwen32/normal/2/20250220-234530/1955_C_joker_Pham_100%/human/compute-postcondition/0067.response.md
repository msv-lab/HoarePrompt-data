The code snippet provided modifies the value of `r` by decrementing it by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `sunks`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each element `a_i` (for i ≠ r) satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.
- `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`.
- `sunks` is incremented by 1.

After executing `r -= 1`, the value of `r` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each element `a_i` (for i ≠ r) satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r` and `r` is decremented by 1, `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
