Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without making any changes to the variables. If `k` is not 0, the code proceeds to check the conditions involving `a[l]` and `a[r]` as described in the precondition.**
