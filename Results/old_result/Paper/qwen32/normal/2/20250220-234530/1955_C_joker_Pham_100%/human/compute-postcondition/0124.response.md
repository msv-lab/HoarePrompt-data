Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (with `a[r]` potentially updated and `a[l]` updated to `a[l] - a[r]`), `l` and `r` are indices in the list `a`, and `sunks` is an integer representing the number of times a condition was met. `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. `sunks` is incremented by 1. `r` is decremented by 1.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `r` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previously described properties and values.
