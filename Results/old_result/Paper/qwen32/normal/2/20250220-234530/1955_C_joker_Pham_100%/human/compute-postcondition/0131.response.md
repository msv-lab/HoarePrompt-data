Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (with `a[r]` potentially updated). If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2`, then the loop breaks without modifying `l`, `r`, `a`, `k`, or `sunks` further. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to `l`, `r`, `a`, `k`, or `sunks`.**
