The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the number of segments of identical characters in the string, adjusting the count by subtracting one if there is at least one occurrence of '0' immediately followed by '1'. It then prints the adjusted count for each test case.
