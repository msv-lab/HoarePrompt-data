Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string; `count` is the number of segments of identical characters in `s`; `flag` is True if there is at least one '0' followed by '1' in `s`, otherwise False; `j` is `len(s) - 1`. If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of segments of identical characters in `s`.**
