Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with more than one character; `count` is 2 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 1; `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` remains 0; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the characters at index `j` and `j + 1` in `s` are different if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`.**
