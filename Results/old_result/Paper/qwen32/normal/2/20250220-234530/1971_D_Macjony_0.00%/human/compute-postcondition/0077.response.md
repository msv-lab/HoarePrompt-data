Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with more than one character; `count` is 2; `flag` is True; `j` is 1; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the characters at index `j` and `j + 1` in `s` are different; the character at index `j` in `s` is '1' and the character at index `j + 1` in `s` is a character different from '1'.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition about the characters at index `j` and `j + 1` in `s` being different still holds, but now `j` points to the second character in the string `s`.
