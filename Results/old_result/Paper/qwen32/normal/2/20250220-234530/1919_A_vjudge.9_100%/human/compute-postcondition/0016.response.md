Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000.
- `a` and `b` are two integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are used in the print statement. The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`, the print statement will always output the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Alice**
