`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 1000. The information about the test cases (integers `a` and `b`) remains unchanged as they have not been affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9.**
