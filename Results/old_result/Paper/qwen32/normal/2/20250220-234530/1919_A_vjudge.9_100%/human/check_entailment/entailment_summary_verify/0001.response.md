### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Game Mechanics Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - The critical observation here is the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b)`).
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and ensure he wins.
     - For example, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move until Alice is forced into a losing position.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can always force a win using a similar mirroring strategy.
     - Alice can start by making a move that maintains the odd difference, ensuring she can always mirror Bob's moves and force him into a losing position.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - Based on the above observations, the winner can be determined solely by checking the parity of `abs(a - b)`.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

#### Program Analysis:
- The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It then checks the parity of `abs(a - b)`:
  - If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
  - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program: it reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading two integers, and determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the two integers.

#### Validation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the key observation about the parity of `abs(a - b)` determining the winner.
- The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `abs(a - b)` and printing the appropriate winner for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem description and the key observations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
