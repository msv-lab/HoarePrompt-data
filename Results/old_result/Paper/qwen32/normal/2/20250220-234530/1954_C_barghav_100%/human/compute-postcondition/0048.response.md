To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `f` remain unchanged (their specific values are not relevant to this particular print statement).
  - `b` is a list with at least one element.
  - `i` is set to 1.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print(b[i], end='')
  ```

Given that `i` is 1, the statement `b[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `b`. Since `b` is a list with at least one element, it must have at least two elements for `b[1]` to be valid (indexing starts from 0).

However, the exact value of `b[1]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 1 of the list `b`.

**Explanation**:
The `print` statement will output the element located at index 1 of the list `b` without adding a newline character at the end due to the `end=''` parameter.

**Output**:
Output: **b[1] (where b[1] is the element at index 1 of the list b)**
