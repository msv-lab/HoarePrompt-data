The function reads two integers `x` and `y` consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, compares them digit by digit, and ensures that the resulting number from `x` is not less than the corresponding number from `y` by swapping digits when necessary. It then prints the modified `x` followed by the modified `y`, each on a new line.
