To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with constraints \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\).
- `a` is a list of digits derived from an input string `s`. Each element in `a` is not less than the corresponding element in `b`.
- `b` is a list of characters derived from a new input string.
- `f` is a flag that becomes 1 if any swap occurs during a loop, otherwise, it remains 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Key Focus:
The `print(a[i], end='')` statement prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` without adding a newline after it.

### Analysis:
- `a` is a list of digits, and since it is derived from an input string `s`, its elements are individual digits (characters '1' through '9').
- `i` is an index that has been incremented by 1. The exact value of `i` is not specified, but it is known to be within the bounds of the list `a` because the precondition states that `a` must have at least `i + 2` elements.

### Conclusion:
Given that `a` is a list of digits and `i` is a valid index into this list, the output of `print(a[i], end='')` will be the digit at position `i` in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the digit at index `i` in the list `a` (where `a` is a list of digits derived from the input string `s` and `i` is a valid index into this list)**
