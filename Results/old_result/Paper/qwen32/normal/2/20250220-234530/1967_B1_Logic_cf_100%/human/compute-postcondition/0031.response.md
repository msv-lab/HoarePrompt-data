The only variable in the loop head is `b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b` and the `min(n, m)` function. The loop iterates from `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `b` was some value between `2` and `min(n, m)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by `1` and still be less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

Let's denote the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration as `b_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `b_prev + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `b_prev`, we can represent the new state of `b` as `b_prev + 1`, but we know it must be less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`, `b` is `b + 1` where `b` is the value from the previous iteration and `b + 1 <= min(n, m)`**
