### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `ans` to \(n\) and then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\). For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

##### Annotations Breakdown:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, converts them to integers, and initializes `ans` to `n`.
- It then iterates over `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
- For each `b`, it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this value to `ans`.
- After processing all `b` values, it prints `ans`.

##### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to \(n\). This is correct because when \(b = 1\), \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\), so there are exactly \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
2. **Condition Check:** The core issue lies in the formula used to count valid pairs for \(b > 1\). The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\). For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided program does not follow this approach. Instead, it uses a simplified but incorrect formula to estimate the number of valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The formula used to count valid pairs for \(b > 1\) is incorrect, leading to wrong results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
