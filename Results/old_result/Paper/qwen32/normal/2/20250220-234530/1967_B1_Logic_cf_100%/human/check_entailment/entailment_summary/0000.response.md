Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
1. If \(b = 1\), then \(a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\). This is always true, so there are exactly \(n\) pairs for \(b = 1\).
2. For \(b > 1\), we need \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes \(d \cdot x + d \cdot y\) being a multiple of \(d \cdot y \cdot d = d^2 \cdot y\), which simplifies to \(x + y\) being a multiple of \(d \cdot y\).

### Simplified Condition:
For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) translates to finding \(a\) such that \((a/b + 1)\) is an integer multiple of \(\gcd(a, b)\). This can be simplified to checking if \((n + b)\) is divisible by \(b^2\) for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the number of valid pairs as follows:
- It initializes `ans` with `n` (which accounts for all pairs where \(b = 1\)).
- It then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

### Verification:
The term \((n + b) // (b * b)\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). Specifically, it counts how many times \(b^2\) divides \(n + b\), which corresponds to the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition for each \(b\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem statement. It accounts for all pairs where \(b = 1\) and correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\).

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
