To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer representing the first number from the input.
- `m` is an integer representing the second number from the input.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `ans` Calculation:**
   - `ans` starts with the value of `n`.
   - For each integer `b` from 2 up to `min(n, m)`, the term `(n + b) // (b * b)` is computed and added to `ans`.
     - Here, `//` denotes integer division.
   
2. **Understanding the Summation Term:**
   - For each `b`, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` computes the integer division of `n + b` by `b * b`.
   - This term will contribute to the final value of `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume specific values for `n` and `m` to illustrate the calculation. Suppose `n = 10` and `m = 5`.

- `ans` starts with `n = 10`.
- We need to calculate the summation for `b` from 2 to `min(10, 5)`, which is 2 to 5.

For `b = 2`:
- `(10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 12 // 4 = 3`
- `ans = 10 + 3 = 13`

For `b = 3`:
- `(10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 13 // 9 = 1`
- `ans = 13 + 1 = 14`

For `b = 4`:
- `(10 + 4) // (4 * 4) = 14 // 16 = 0`
- `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`

For `b = 5`:
- `(10 + 5) // (5 * 5) = 15 // 25 = 0`
- `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`

So, if `n = 10` and `m = 5`, `ans` would be `14`.

### General Case:
Without specific values for `n` and `m`, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the formula provided.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b ranging from 2 to min(n, m))**
