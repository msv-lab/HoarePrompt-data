### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `ans` to \(n\) and then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\). For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to \(n\). This accounts for the pairs where \(b = 1\). When \(b = 1\), the condition simplifies to checking if \(a + 1\) is a multiple of 1, which is always true. Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\). This part is correct.

2. **Condition Check:** The program uses \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to count the valid pairs for each \(b\). However, this formula does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all \(a\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\). For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided function summary does not reflect this correct approach. Instead, it suggests using the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\), which is not valid for the problem.

#### Verification Using Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function calculates `ans` based on the formula `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This formula does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function summary does not accurately describe the necessary condition checks, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
