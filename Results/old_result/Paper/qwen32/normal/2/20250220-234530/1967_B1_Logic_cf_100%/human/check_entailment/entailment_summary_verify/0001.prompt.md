You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the formula `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`, and then prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of the Given Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `ans` to \(n\) and then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\). For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to \(n\). This is incorrect because it does not account for the pairs where \(b = 1\). For \(b = 1\), the condition simplifies to checking if \(a + 1\) is a multiple of 1, which is always true. Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).

2. **Condition Check:** The program uses \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to count the valid pairs for each \(b\). However, this formula does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(a\) and checking the condition directly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\). For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
