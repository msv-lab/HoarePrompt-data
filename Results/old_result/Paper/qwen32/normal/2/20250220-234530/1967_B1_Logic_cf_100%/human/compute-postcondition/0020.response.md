The code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. Given that `b` is defined as `b + 1` in the initial state, we need to incorporate this into our calculation.

Let's break down the changes:
- `b` is incremented by 1 before the calculation.
- `ans` is updated by adding the integer division result of `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

Since `b` is incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `b` as `b_new = b + 1`.

The expression to be added to `ans` becomes:
\[ \text{expression} = \frac{n + b_{\text{new}}}{b_{\text{new}} \times b_{\text{new}}} = \frac{n + (b + 1)}{(b + 1) \times (b + 1)} = \frac{n + b + 1}{(b + 1)^2} \]

Thus, the new value of `ans` will be:
\[ \text{ans}_{\text{new}} = \text{ans} + \frac{n + b + 1}{(b + 1)^2} \]

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged except for `b` which has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b + 1`, `ans` is `ans + (n + b + 1) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1))`**.
