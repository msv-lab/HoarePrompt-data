To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop iterates over `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m) + 1`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

Let's analyze the loop condition and the variables:
- The loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
- At the end of each iteration, `b` is incremented by 1.

Since `b` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `b` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `x + 1`.

No changes are needed for `n` and `m` since they are not modified within the loop body according to the information given.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Given that `b` is incremented by 1, we can specify the new value of `b` explicitly:

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Since we need to reflect the exact state before the loop starts the next iteration, we can write it as:

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**

So, if `b` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, now `b` is `x + 1`.

Final State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b + 1`**

This is the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
