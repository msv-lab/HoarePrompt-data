Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer input provided by the user, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is a list. If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is set to `[i]`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` is set to `[i]`. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or it remains unchanged unless `s` was `'='`, in which case `pans` contains the new value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the string input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, otherwise it remains the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` appended to its previous contents if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
