To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 0. This variable also does not directly affect the print statement.
- `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, or a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given this information, the print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so it will be the next integer after the last `i` used to update `mak`.

Since `mak2` is explicitly set to `mak`, the values of `mak` and `mak2` will be identical. Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak] (where [mak] is the largest i for which the input was '<', or i if s is '<', or 0 if no such i exists, and [i] is the next integer after the last i used to update mak)**
