To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration based on the given conditions.

### Key Variables:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (not modified by the loop).
- `n`: An integer greater than 1 (number of iterations).
- `mak2`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received (not modified by the loop).
- `pans`: A list that accumulates indices where the input was `'='`.
- `mak`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`.

### Loop Behavior:
- For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
  - Print `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, `mak2`.
  - Read input `s`.
  - If `s` is `'<'`, update `mak` to `i` and set `pans` to `[i]`.
  - If `s` is `'='`, append `i` to `pans`.

### Analysis:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- `mak` will hold the highest index where the input was `'<'`.
- `pans` will contain all indices where the input was `'='`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mak2` remains unchanged.
- `mak` holds the highest index `i` where the input was `'<'`.
- `pans` contains all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on the inputs received during each iteration. However, the structure of the state remains consistent with the described behavior.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.**
