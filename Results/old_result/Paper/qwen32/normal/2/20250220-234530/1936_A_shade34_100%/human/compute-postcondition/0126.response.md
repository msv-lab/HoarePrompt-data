The given code snippet sets the variable `mak` to 0. This means that regardless of its previous value, `mak` is now explicitly set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `mak` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.**
