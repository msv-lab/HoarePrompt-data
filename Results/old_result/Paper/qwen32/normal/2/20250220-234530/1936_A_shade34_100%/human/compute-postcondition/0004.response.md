To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak` is explicitly set to 0.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state, so it will result in a `NameError` if used without being assigned a value.

Given this information, the `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- `'?'` is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- `mak` is explicitly set to 0, so it will print `0`.
- Since `mak` is printed twice, it will appear as `0 0`.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so attempting to print `i` will raise a `NameError`.

However, since the task asks us to provide the most precise description based on the given information and to assume the code runs without errors, we should infer that `i` must have been defined somewhere in the code that is not shown here. Without loss of generality, let's assume `i` is some integer value, say `k`.

### Assuming `i` is defined and equals `k`:
- The `print` statement will output `'?'`, followed by `mak` (which is `0`), followed by `mak` again (`0`), and then `i` twice (both times `k`).

Thus, the output would be:
Output: **? 0 0 k k (where k is the value of i)**

However, since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, the most accurate answer considering the provided information would be that a `NameError` would occur. But adhering to the task requirement to provide the output based on the given information and assuming `i` is defined:

Output: **? 0 0 k k (where k is the value of i)**

If we strictly follow the given information and do not assume `i` is defined:

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
