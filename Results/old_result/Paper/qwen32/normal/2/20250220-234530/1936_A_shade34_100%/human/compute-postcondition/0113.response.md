The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` itself is not changed by this operation, only its value is used and then `i` would typically be incremented elsewhere in the code (as per the initial state description).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1; `pans` contains the new value of `i` appended to it.**
