To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `mak` is the current value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements.
- `i` is \(k + 1\).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans` List**: It contains indices where the input was `'='`. Since it must contain at least two elements, we know `len(pans) >= 2`.
2. **`mak` Variable**: This variable holds the current value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise it remains 0. Given that `mak` is used as an index for `pans`, `mak` should be a valid index within the range of `pans`. If no `'>'` input was received, `mak` would be 0, which is still a valid index since `pans` has at least two elements.
3. **`i` Variable**: It is defined as \(k + 1\). Since `i` is used as an index for `pans`, `i` should also be a valid index within the range of `pans`.

### Output Breakdown:
- The first argument to `print` is the literal string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `pans[mak]`. Since `mak` is an index into `pans`, this will print the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `pans[i]`. Since `i` is also an index into `pans`, this will print the element at index `i` in the `pans` list.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where `mak` and `i` are indices into the `pans` list, and `pans` contains at least two elements)**

This describes the output precisely based on the given initial state and the structure of the code.
