Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `mak` is set to `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `mak`:**
   - `mak` is determined by the input string. If the input string is `'<'`, then `mak` is set to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - Since the specific input string is not provided, we cannot determine with certainty whether `mak` is `i` or 0. However, we can describe it based on the condition.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed. Therefore, the value of `i` printed will be the value after it has been incremented.

### Output Description:
- The print statement will output a question mark followed by four values: `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- The value of `mak` depends on the input string. If the input string is `'<'`, `mak` will be the value of `i` before it was incremented. Otherwise, `mak` will be 0.
- The value of `i` printed will be the value of `i` after it has been incremented.

Given this information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is i if the input string is '<', otherwise 0, and [i] is the value of i after it has been incremented)**
