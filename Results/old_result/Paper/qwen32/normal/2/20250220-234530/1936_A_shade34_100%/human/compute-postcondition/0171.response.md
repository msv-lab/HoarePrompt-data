The code snippet reads a string input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, or `pans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is an empty list; `s` is the input string.**
