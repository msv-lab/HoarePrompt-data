The code snippet assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. This means `pans` now holds a single-element list containing the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the current value of `i`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the string input by the user.**
