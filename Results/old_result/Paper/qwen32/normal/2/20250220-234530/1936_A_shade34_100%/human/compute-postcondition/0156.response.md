To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). The exact value of `t` is not specified, but it is within this range.
- `n`: Greater than 1. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is greater than 1.
- `mak2`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. The exact value of `mak2` is not specified, but it depends on the inputs received.
- `mak`: `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0. The exact value of `mak` is not specified, but it depends on the inputs received.
- `pans`: A list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. The exact contents of `pans` are not specified, but they depend on the inputs received.
- `i`: 4. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak` again, `i`, and `i` again.
- `mak` is described as being `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise it remains 0. Since the exact input sequence is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`. However, based on the given information, `mak` could be either 0 or 4 depending on whether there was an input `'<'` at index 4.
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can say that the output will be `'?'`, followed by two values of `mak` (which could be either 0 or 4), and then two values of `i` (which is 4).

Since the exact value of `mak` is not determined by the provided initial state, we describe it as `mak` (where `mak` is either 0 or 4 based on the input conditions).

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 4 4 (where mak is either 0 or 4 based on the input conditions)**
