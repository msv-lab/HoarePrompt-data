The given code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`, `i`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i` if the input was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
