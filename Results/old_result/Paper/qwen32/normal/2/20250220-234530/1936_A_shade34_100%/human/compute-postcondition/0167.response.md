The code snippet provided resets the `pans` list to an empty list. This means that all previous elements in `pans` are removed, and `pans` is now an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer input provided by the user, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is an empty list.**
