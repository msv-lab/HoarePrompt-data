Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, or a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s` is the string input.**

Natural Language: The value of `mak` is now set to the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous values except `mak`, which has been updated.
