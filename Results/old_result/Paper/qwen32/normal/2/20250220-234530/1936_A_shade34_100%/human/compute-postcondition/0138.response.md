To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i` and `pans`.

Here's the relevant part of the problem:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received
- `mak` is the current value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect this increment. The variable `pans` does not change within the loop head; it is only used to determine the range of the loop.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a value of `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `mak2` remains the same
- `mak` remains the same
- `pans` remains the same
- `i` is incremented by 1

Thus, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the current value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, then:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the current value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements, `i` is \(k + 1\)**.
