The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input from the user and assigning it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`) are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `n` now holds the integer value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`; `mak` is the highest index `i` where the user input was `'>'`**.
