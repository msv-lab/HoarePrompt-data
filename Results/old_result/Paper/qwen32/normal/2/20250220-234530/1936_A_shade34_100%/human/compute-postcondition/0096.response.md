Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `pans` is an empty list.
- `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. **`mak`**: According to the initial state, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. Since there's no additional context about any inputs being received, we assume `mak` is 0.
3. **`mak2`**: Similar to `mak`, `mak2` is also the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. Thus, `mak2` is also assumed to be 0.
4. **`i`**: The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown from the given information. Therefore, we cannot determine its value precisely. We will denote it as `[i]` to indicate that its value is unknown.
5. **`mak2`**: This is the same as the third argument, which is `mak2` and is assumed to be 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `i` and the assumption that no `'<'` inputs have been received, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 [i] 0** (where `[i]` is the value of `i`, which is unknown from the given information)
