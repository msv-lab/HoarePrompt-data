To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this particular task.
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user input. This variable is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this particular task.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.
- `mak2` is initialized to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this particular task.
- `pans` is a list containing at least two elements.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break down the print statement:
- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this will print the first element of the list `pans`.
- `pans[mak]`: This is the same as the previous one, so it will again print the first element of the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]`: Here, `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, since the problem specifies that `pans` contains at least two elements, we can assume `i` is a valid index into the list `pans`.

Given that `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` will always refer to the first element of `pans`. The value of `pans[i]` depends on the value of `i`, but since `i` is not specified, we can only say that it refers to some element in the list `pans`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [element of pans at index i] [element of pans at index i] (where [first element of pans] is the first element of the list pans and [element of pans at index i] is the element of the list pans at index i)**
