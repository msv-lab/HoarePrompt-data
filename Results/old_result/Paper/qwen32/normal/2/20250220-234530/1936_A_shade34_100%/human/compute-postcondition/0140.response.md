The provided Python code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `pans`, `i`) are modified by this function call. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the current value of `i` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements, `i` is \(k + 1\)**.
