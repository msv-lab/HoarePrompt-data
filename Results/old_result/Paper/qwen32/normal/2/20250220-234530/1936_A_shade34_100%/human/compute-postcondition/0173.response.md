The code snippet updates the variable `mak` to the current index `i`. Given the initial state, `mak` is updated to `i`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is an empty list, and `s` is the input string which is `'<'`.**
