The provided code snippet consists solely of `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console immediately. It does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`; `mak` is 0**.
