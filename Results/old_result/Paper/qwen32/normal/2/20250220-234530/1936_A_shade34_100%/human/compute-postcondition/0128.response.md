Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `mak` is set to 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='` and must contain at least two elements.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

#### Variables in the Print Statement:
1. `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this refers to the first element of the `pans` list.
2. `pans[i]`: Here, `i` is not defined in the initial state. However, since it is used twice in the print statement, we need to consider what `i` could be. Given the context, it seems likely that `i` should be another valid index in the `pans` list. But without a specific definition for `i`, we can assume `i` is also 0 (the same as `mak`) to provide a concrete example.

### Assumptions:
- Let's assume `pans` contains at least two elements, as required by the initial state. For example, let `pans = [2, 5]`.

### Calculation:
- `pans[mak]` where `mak` is 0: This is `pans[0]`, which is `2` in our example.
- `pans[i]` where `i` is also assumed to be 0: This is `pans[0]`, which is `2` in our example.

### Final Output:
Given the assumptions, the print statement will output:
```python
print('?', 2, 2, 2, 2)
```

However, since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, the most precise answer would acknowledge the potential variability of `i` while providing a concrete example.

### Final Answer:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and i is an index in the pans list)**

For a concrete example with `pans = [2, 5]` and assuming `i = 0`:
Output: **? 2 2 2 2**
