To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`, so we can only adjust `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
2. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` is the loop control variable and is automatically initialized by the `range(n)` function. We don't need to set `i` manually before the loop starts because it will be set to 0 when the loop begins.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is `n`. It must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list**
