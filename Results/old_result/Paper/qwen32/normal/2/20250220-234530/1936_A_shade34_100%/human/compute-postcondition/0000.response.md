To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate over a range. The range is determined by the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, the critical factor here is the input value.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Value (`int(input())`)**: This value determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, the input value must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **Variable `_`**: This is a throwaway variable and does not need any specific initial state since it is reassigned in each iteration of the loop.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop is controlled by the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and each test case involves an input value for `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for each test case.

However, given the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), we know that `n` will always be at least 2, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring that `n` is within its specified range for each test case.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\)**.
