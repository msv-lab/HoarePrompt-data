The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, `i` is 5.**
