Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `tree` is an empty deque. `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and `empty` is False. If `empty` was initially True, `tree` is now a deque containing the integers `u` and `v`. If `empty` was initially False, `tree` remains unchanged if `v` is neither the first nor the last element of `tree` and `u` does not match the first or last element of `tree`. If `v` is the first element of `tree`, `tree` remains unchanged. If `v` is the last element of `tree`, `tree` now contains its original elements plus `u`. If `v` is not the first or last element of `tree` and `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` now has `v` as its first element. If `v` is not the first or last element of `tree` and `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` now contains the previously last element of `tree` followed by `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, `i` is 4. If `empty` were True, `tree` would include the integers `u` and `v`. Otherwise, if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` has `u` appended to its left. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` includes the new element `u`. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, then `tree` has `v` as its first element followed by the original elements of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` includes the additional element `v`; otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, and `i` is 5. If `empty` is True, `tree` now includes both the integers `u` and `v` appended to it. If `empty` is False, `tree` is modified based on the values of `u` and `v`: if `v` equals the first element of the `tree`, `u` is prepended to the `tree`; if `v` equals the last element of the `tree`, `u` is appended to the `tree`; if `u` equals the first element of the `tree`, `v` is prepended to the `tree`; if `u` equals the last element of the `tree`, `v` is appended to the `tree`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
