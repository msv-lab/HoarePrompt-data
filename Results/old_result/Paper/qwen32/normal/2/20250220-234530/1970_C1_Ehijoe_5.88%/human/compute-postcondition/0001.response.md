The code snippet initializes a deque named `tree`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, or the initial node `u_1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `tree` is an empty deque.**
