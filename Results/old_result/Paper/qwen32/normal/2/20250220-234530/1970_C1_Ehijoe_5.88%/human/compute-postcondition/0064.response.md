Functionality: **The function reads input values representing a tree with exactly two leaves and an initial node where a stone is placed. It determines whether, starting from the initial node, a player named Ron can make a move that results in an odd number of moves, or if Hermione can ensure that all possible moves result in an even number of moves. The function prints "Ron" if Ron can make such a move, otherwise it prints "Hermione".**
