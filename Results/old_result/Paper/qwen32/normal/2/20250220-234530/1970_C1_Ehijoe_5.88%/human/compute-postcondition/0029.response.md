The code snippet `tree.append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the list `tree`. Therefore, `tree` now includes both the integer `u` and the integer `v`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `tree` now contains an additional element, `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, `tree` now includes the integers `u` and `v`, `i` is 4.**
