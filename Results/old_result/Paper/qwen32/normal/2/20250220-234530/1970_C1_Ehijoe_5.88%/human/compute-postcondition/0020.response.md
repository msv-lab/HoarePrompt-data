Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `tree` is a deque containing the previously last element of `tree` followed by `v`, `empty` is False, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `v` is not equal to `tree[0]`, `v` is not equal to `tree[-2]`, and `u` is equal to `tree[-2]`.**

In simple terms, the `tree` deque now includes the new value `v` appended to its end. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
