The code snippet appends the integer `u` to the left end of the list `tree`. This means that `tree` now has `u` as its first element, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tree`, as `u` is added to its beginning. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, `v`, `empty`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, `i` is 5, and `tree` now has `u` as its first element followed by the previous elements of `tree`.**
