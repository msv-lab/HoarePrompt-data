The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'..##..##'`. None of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n` are used within this specific `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of this particular line of code.

Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is equal to `t`.
- `c` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer with specific conditions based on its value.

However, since these variables are not referenced in the `print` statement, they do not affect the output.

Output: **..##..##**
