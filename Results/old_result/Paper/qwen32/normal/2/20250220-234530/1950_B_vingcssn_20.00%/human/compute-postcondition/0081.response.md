Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
  - `casos` is equal to `t`.
  - `c` is 2.
  - `n` is the integer provided by the user input.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('##..##..')
  ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`. It simply outputs the string `'##..##..'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **##..##..**
