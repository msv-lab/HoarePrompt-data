The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'##..##..'`. This string is explicitly defined within the `print` function and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`) mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20, inclusive.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is an input integer that could have different values depending on the conditions specified, but it does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'##..##..'`, the value of `n` or any other variable does not influence this output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##..**
