The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `casos`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. The loop will continue as long as `c` is less than `casos`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0, and `casos` is equal to `t` (which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be 1, and `casos` should remain equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, `c` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is equal to 1, then `n` remains 1. If `n` is equal to 2, 3, or 4, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, then `n` could be any other integer.**
