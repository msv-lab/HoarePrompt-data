The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'..##'`. The initial state provides details about variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **..##**
