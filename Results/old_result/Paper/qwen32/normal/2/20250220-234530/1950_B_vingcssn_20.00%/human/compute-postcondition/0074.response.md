Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is set to 2.
- `n` is the integer provided by the user input.

The print statement is:
```python
print('..##..')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`. It simply prints the string `'..##..'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **..##..**
