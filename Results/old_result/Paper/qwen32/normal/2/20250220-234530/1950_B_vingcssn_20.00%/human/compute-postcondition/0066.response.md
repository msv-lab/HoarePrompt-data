Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is set to 2.
- `n` is the integer provided by the user input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`) mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'##'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'##'`, the output will be exactly that string regardless of the values of `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`.

Output: **##**
