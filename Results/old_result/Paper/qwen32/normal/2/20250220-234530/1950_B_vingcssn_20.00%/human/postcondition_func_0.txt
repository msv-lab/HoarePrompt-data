The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. It then prints a specific pattern of hashes (`#`) and dots (`.`) based on the value of `n` for each test case. If `n` is not between 1 and 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'.
