### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program explicitly checks for the values of `n` from 1 to 4 and prints the corresponding checkerboard patterns. However, for any value of `n` greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango," which is not in compliance with the problem description. The problem requires the program to generate a checkerboard pattern for any `n` within the range of 1 to 20.

The annotated code confirms this behavior, showing that the program only handles specific hardcoded cases and does not provide a general solution for all possible values of `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
