Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is explicitly set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('##')`. This statement directly prints the string `'##'` to the console. None of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`) are used in this specific `print` statement.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'##'`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Output: **##**
