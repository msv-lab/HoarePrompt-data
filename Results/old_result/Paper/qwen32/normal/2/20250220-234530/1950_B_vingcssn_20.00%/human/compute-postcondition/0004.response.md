Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to 1.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print('##')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'##'` directly. None of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n` are used in this particular `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'##'`.

Output: **##**
