In this task, we are given the initial state of several variables and a print statement. Let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is set to 2.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`) are used within the print statement. The print statement is simply:

```python
print('##..')
```

This means that the output will be exactly the string `'##..'` regardless of the values of `t`, `casos`, `c`, or `n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **##..**
