The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `list0`. The initial state specifies that `T` must be greater than 0, and `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input. However, the code does not use `T`, `n`, `x`, or `y` directly. Instead, it creates a new list `list0` from the input.

Therefore, the output state includes the newly created list `list0` containing the integers from the input, while `T`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `list0` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
