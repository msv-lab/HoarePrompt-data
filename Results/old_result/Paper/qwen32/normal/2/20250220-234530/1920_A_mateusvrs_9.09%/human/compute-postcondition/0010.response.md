The code snippet updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `bx` was initially `-1` and `x` is a positive integer (since `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`), `bx` will be updated to the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `x`; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; the current value of `a` is 1**.
