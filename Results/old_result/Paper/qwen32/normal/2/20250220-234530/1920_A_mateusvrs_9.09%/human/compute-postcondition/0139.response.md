Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2` and must contain at least one element, `n` is the input integer, and `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is `2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains `0`. `i` is the next element in `cx` after the current `i`.**
