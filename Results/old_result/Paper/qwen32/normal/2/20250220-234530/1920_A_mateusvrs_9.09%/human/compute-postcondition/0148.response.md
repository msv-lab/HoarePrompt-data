Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x), where `a` can be 1, 2, or 3, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. All pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case. The function processes these constraints and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
