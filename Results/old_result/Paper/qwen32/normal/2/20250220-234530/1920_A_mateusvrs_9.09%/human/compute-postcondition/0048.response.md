The code appends the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. The values of `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp` remain unchanged, but `r` now includes the newly calculated value.

Output State: **`tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`; `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
