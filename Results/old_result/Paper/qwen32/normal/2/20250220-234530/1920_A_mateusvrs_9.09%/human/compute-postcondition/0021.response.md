The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given the initial conditions:

- If `a` is 1 or 3, `ax` is initially 1000000007.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is initially the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.

After executing the code:
- If `a` is 1 or 3, `ax` will be updated to `min(x, 1000000007)`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` will be updated to `min(x, min(1000000007, x))`, which simplifies to `min(x, 1000000007)`.

Therefore, in all cases, `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`; `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**
