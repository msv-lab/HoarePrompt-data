To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the set `cx` and updates the variable `tmp`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `cx`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
- If `i` is within this range, it increments `tmp` by 1.

### Given Information:
- `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`.
- `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`.
- `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3`.
- `bx < ax` ensures there is a valid range for `i` to fall into.
- `tmp` starts at `0` and is incremented for each `i` in `cx` that falls within `[bx, ax]`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes, `tmp` will hold the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `tmp` will be the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `bx <= i <= ax`. All other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

### Output State:
Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3`, `n` is `0`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.**

In simpler terms, `tmp` will be the number of elements in `cx` that lie between `bx` and `ax` (both inclusive).
