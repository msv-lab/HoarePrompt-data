The given code snippet updates the value of `ax` using the `min` function, comparing its current value with `x`. Let's analyze the impact:

- If `a` is 1 or 3, `ax` was initially set to 1000000007. After the operation, `ax` will be the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` was initially set to the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. After the operation, `ax` will remain the same because it is already the minimum of these two values.

Given the initial conditions and the operation performed, the updated value of `ax` will be `min(1000000007, x)` if `a` is 1 or 3, and simply `min(ax, x)` if `a` is 2, which effectively leaves `ax` unchanged if it was already the minimum.

Thus, the new value of `ax` is `min(1000000007, x)` regardless of the initial value of `ax`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; if `a` is 1 or 3, `cx` is an empty set, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is `min(1000000007, x)`; `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**
