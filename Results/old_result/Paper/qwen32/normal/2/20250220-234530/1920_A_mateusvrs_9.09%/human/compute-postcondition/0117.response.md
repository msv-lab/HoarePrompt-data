The given code modifies the value of `ax` by taking the minimum of its current value and `x`. Let's analyze the changes:

- If `a` is not 2, `ax` was initially set to 1000000007. After the operation, `ax` will be the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` was initially set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. After the operation, `ax` will remain the same because it is already the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.

Other variables (`a`, `x`, `bx`, `cx`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `{x}`, `n` is greater than 1, `r` includes the element 1000000009.**
