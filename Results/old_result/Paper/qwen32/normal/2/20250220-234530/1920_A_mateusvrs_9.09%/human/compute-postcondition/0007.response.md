In the given task, the for loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that could potentially need adjustment is `n`.

Given that `n` is already defined as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Thus, no adjustment to `n` is necessary based on the loop head alone.

Here's the state before the loop starts, considering only the objects in the loop head:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1**.

Since the loop will execute as long as `n` is within the specified range, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.
