The provided code snippet only contains the line `n = int(input())`, which reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the variables `bx`, `ax`, `r`, `tmp`, or `cx` in any way.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the variable `n`.

Output State: **`bx` and `ax` are integers. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `n` is an input integer.**
