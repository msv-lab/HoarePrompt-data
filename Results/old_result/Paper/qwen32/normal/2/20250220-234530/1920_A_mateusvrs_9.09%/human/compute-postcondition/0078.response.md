Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n + 1`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `ax` is `1000000007` if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, and `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
