Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; `a` is not equal to 2**

Natural Language Explanation: The set `cx` now contains the integer `x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
