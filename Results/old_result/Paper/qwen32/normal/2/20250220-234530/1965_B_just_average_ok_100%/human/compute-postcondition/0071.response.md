To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code execution step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 1000. This variable is not directly used in the given code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input. It is not explicitly used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
3. **`k`**: The second integer from the input. This value is crucial as it determines the construction of the `nums` list.
4. **`nums`**: A list constructed based on specific rules:
   - Starts with predefined powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
   - Followed by `k + 1`
   - Followed by `k + nums[idx] + 1` where `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - The element `2^idx` is removed from the list.
5. **`idx`**: The largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists.
6. **`i`**: The index at which the loop terminates. This variable is not mentioned in the context of the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Construction of `nums`:
- The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 up to `1048576`.
- We need to find `idx`, the largest index such that `nums[idx] <= k`.
- If `idx` is found, `2^idx` is removed from the list.
- Then, `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are appended to the list.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `k = 100` for demonstration purposes:
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 100 is 64, so `idx = 6` (since `nums[6] = 64`).
- Remove `2^6 = 64` from the list.
- Append `k + 1 = 101` and `k + nums[idx] + 1 = 100 + 64 + 1 = 165` to the list.

Thus, the `nums` list would look like this:
`[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 101, 165]`

### General Case:
For any given `k`, the `nums` list will be constructed similarly:
- Identify the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and remove it.
- Append `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.

### Final Output:
Given the construction rules, the output will be the modified `nums` list based on the value of `k`.

Output: **[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1] (where idx is the largest index such that nums[idx] <= k and 2^idx is removed from the list)**
