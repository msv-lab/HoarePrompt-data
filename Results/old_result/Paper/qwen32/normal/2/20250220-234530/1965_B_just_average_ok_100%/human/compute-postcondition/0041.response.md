To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the given conditions.

The loop iterates over the list `nums` and checks if the current element `nums[i]` is greater than `k`. If it finds such an element, it sets `idx` to `i - 1` and breaks out of the loop. If no such element is found during the entire iteration, `idx` remains `-1`.

Here's the detailed reasoning:

- The loop starts with `i = 0`.
- It checks each element in `nums` until it finds an element greater than `k`.
- If `k` is less than or equal to the smallest element in `nums` (which is `1`), the loop will iterate through all elements without breaking, and `idx` will remain `-1`.
- If `k` is between two elements in `nums`, the loop will stop when it finds the first element greater than `k` and set `idx` to the index of the previous element.
- If `k` is greater than the largest element in `nums` (which is `1048576`), the loop will iterate through all elements without breaking, and `idx` will be set to the last index of `nums`, which is `20`.

Given the above logic, the final state of `idx` depends on the value of `k` relative to the elements in `nums`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. If `k <= 1`, `idx` remains `-1`.
2. If `1 < k <= 2`, `idx` becomes `0`.
3. If `2 < k <= 4`, `idx` becomes `1`.
4. If `4 < k <= 8`, `idx` becomes `2`.
5. If `8 < k <= 16`, `idx` becomes `3`.
6. If `16 < k <= 32`, `idx` becomes `4`.
7. If `32 < k <= 64`, `idx` becomes `5`.
8. If `64 < k <= 128`, `idx` becomes `6`.
9. If `128 < k <= 256`, `idx` becomes `7`.
10. If `256 < k <= 512`, `idx` becomes `8`.
11. If `512 < k <= 1024`, `idx` becomes `9`.
12. If `1024 < k <= 2048`, `idx` becomes `10`.
13. If `2048 < k <= 4096`, `idx` becomes `11`.
14. If `4096 < k <= 8192`, `idx` becomes `12`.
15. If `8192 < k <= 16384`, `idx` becomes `13`.
16. If `16384 < k <= 32768`, `idx` becomes `14`.
17. If `32768 < k <= 65536`, `idx` becomes `15`.
18. If `65536 < k <= 131072`, `idx` becomes `16`.
19. If `131072 < k <= 262144`, `idx` becomes `17`.
20. If `262144 < k <= 524288`, `idx` becomes `18`.
21. If `524288 < k <= 1048576`, `idx` becomes `19`.
22. If `k > 1048576`, `idx` becomes `20`.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `k`, we can conclude that `idx` will be set to the appropriate value based on the above conditions.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is dependent on the value of `k`. However, since we need to provide a specific output state, let's assume `k` is such that the loop iterates through all elements without breaking, which means `k > 1048576`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, nums is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], idx is 20.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `idx` will be `20` if `k` is greater than `1048576`. If `k` is less than or equal to `1048576`, `idx` will be set to the index of the largest element in `nums` that is less than `k`.
