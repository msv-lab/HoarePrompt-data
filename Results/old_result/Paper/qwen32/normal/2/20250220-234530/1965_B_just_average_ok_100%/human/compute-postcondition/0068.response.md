The code appends a new element to the list `nums`. This new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (unchanged).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (unchanged).
- `k` is the second integer from the input (unchanged).
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2 up to `2^19` followed by `k + 1` (this list will be updated).
- `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists (unchanged).
- `i` is the index at which the loop terminates (unchanged).

After executing the line `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)`, the list `nums` will have an additional element at the end, which is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`]; `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists; `i` is the index at which the loop terminates.**
