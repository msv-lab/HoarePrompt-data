The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. Specifically, it appends the difference between `k` and the largest element in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k` (which is `nums[idx]`). 

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.
- `nums` now includes the new element `k - nums[idx]` appended to its end.
- `idx` remains the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists.
- `i` remains the index at which the loop terminates.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`], `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists, `i` is the index at which the loop terminates.**
