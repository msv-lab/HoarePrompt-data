To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and modifies the `nums` list based on the given `n` and `k` values. Let's break down the steps and then generalize the final state.

### Loop Analysis

For each test case:
1. **Initialization**: `nums` is initialized to a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
2. **Finding `idx`**: The loop finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is greater than the largest power of 2 in the list, `idx` is set to the last index of the list (20).
3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - A new element `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`.
   - Another new element `k + 1` is appended to `nums`.
   - Yet another new element `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to `nums`.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is `nums[idx]`) is removed from `nums`.
4. **Output**: The length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

### Generalization

Since the loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases, the final output state will consist of the results of processing each test case independently. Each test case modifies its own `nums` list and prints the result without affecting the other test cases.

### Final Output State

The final output state after all iterations will be a series of outputs, one for each test case. Each output consists of:
- The length of the modified `nums` list.
- The elements of the modified `nums` list.

Since the problem asks for a single output state, we can summarize it as follows:

**Output State: **For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list. The modifications for each test case are independent and do not affect the others.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is a concatenation of the outputs for each individual test case, where each output includes the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the modified `nums` list after processing the respective `n` and `k` values.
