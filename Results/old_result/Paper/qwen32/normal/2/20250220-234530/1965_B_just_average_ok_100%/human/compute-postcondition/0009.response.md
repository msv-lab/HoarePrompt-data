The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that `0 ≤ i < len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a predefined list with 21 elements, `len(nums)` is 21. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than 21.

Given the current state, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], and `idx` is either `i - 1` if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, or it remains `-1` if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], and `idx` is either `i - 1` if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, or it remains `-1` if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. `i` is `i + 1`.**

To make it clear:

If `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], and `idx` is either `i - 1` if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, or it remains `-1` if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. `i` is `i + 1`.**

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], and `idx` is either `i - 1` if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, or it remains `-1` if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. `i` is `i + 1`.**

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], and `idx` is either `i - 1` if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, or it remains `-1` if no element in `nums` is greater than `k`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
