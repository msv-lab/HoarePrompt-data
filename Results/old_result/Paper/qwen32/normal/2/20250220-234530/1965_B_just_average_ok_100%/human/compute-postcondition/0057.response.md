To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]
- `idx` is -1
- `i` is 0

The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `idx`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is -1, `i` is 1**
