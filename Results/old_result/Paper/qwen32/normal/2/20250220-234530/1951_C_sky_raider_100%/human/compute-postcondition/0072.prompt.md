Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Additionally, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - After `n` iterations:
     - `t = n * s`
     - `k = k_initial - n * s`
     - `c = sum(s * (l[i] + i * s) for i in range(n))`
     - `n`, `m`, `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
     - `s` remains the same as it is recalculated in each iteration based on the current value of `k`.

Let's express this in the required format:

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n-1`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - S_total`, `l` remains unchanged, `t` is `S_total`, `c` is the accumulated sum of `s * (l[i] + t + accumulated_s_for_previous_iterations)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `S_total` minus the sum of `min(m, k)` over all iterations, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is the sum of `min(m, k)` over all iterations, `c` is the accumulated cost calculated as the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` over all iterations, `s` is `min(m, k)` in the last iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
