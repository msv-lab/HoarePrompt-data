To determine the new state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's break down the changes:

Given:
- `t` is `s + s` which simplifies to `2 * s`.
- `n` must be greater than `s + 2`.
- `m` is an integer read from the input.
- `k` is an integer read from the input minus `2 * s`.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + s)`.
- `i` is `s + 2`.

The code snippet is:
```python
c += s * (l[i] + t)
```

Since `t` is `2 * s`, the code can be rewritten as:
```python
c += s * (l[i] + 2 * s)
```

This means that `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + 2 * s)` to its current value.

Thus, the new value of `c` is:
```python
c = c + s * (l[i] + 2 * s)
```

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `2 * s`; `n` must be greater than `s + 2`; `m` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input minus `2 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[i] + 2 * s)`; `i` is `s + 2`.**
