The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, `k`, `t`, or `c`. The only change is that `l` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`i` is `n` (where `n` is the first integer from the input), `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `S_total`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` is `S_total`, `c` is the accumulated sum of `s * (l[i] + t + accumulated_s_for_previous_iterations)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
