The given code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`iterations_left`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`) are modified by this code.

Output State: **`iterations_left` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `x` is the count of how many times `x` appears in `a`; `ans` is 0.**
