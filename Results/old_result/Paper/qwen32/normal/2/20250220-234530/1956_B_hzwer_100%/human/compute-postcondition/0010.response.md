The code increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `x` is the next element in the list `a`, the value at `cnt[x]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `x` has been incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
