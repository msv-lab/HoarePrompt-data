The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to reflect the start of the next iteration. The other variables (`iterations_left`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`) are not directly controlled by the loop head and should remain as they are, except for `iterations_left` which needs to be checked to ensure the loop can continue.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element being processed from the list `a`.
2. For the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in the list `a`.
3. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a` and `iterations_left` is greater than 0.

Given that `iterations_left` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `iterations_left` is still greater than 0 before starting the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in the list `a` and the decremented `iterations_left`.

State: **`iterations_left` is decremented by 1 from its previous value and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one element; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the integer at index `x` is incremented by 1; `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
