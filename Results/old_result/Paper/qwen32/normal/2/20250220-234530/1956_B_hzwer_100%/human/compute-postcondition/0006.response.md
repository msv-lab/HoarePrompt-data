The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. After executing the code, the value at index `x` in `cnt` will be 1 (if it was 0 before) or incremented by 1 (if it had a different value).

Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `cnt[x]` will be incremented by 1. All other elements in `cnt` and the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.**
