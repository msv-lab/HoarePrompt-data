Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of each unique tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` for all elements in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing for all elements in the list `a`, the output state will include:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.
- The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged as it holds the list of test cases.
- The variable `results` remains an empty list as no results are being appended to it within the given loop.
- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are parameters extracted from the current test case.
- The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is the list of integers being processed.
- The variable `freq` will now contain the count of each unique pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered during the loop's execution for all elements in `a`.
- The variable `beautiful_count` will hold the total number of pairs of elements in `a` that meet the condition where `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary.
