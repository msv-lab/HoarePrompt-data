Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a); `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count` which is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`; `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`; `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element; `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1; `mod_x` is `num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`; `num` is the next element in `a`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the corresponding value in `freq`.**
