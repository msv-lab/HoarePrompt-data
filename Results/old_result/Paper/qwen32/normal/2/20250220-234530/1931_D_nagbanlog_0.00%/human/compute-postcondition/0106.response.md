Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is set to `0` and `beautiful_count` remains 0. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is already in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is set to `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]`.**
