Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (number of test cases).
- `test_cases`: A list of at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`.
- `results`: A list containing `beautiful_count`.
- `case`: The next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y`: The first three elements of `case['params']`.
- `a`: `case['array']`, which is an array (list) with at least one element.
- `freq`: A dictionary that counts occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
- `mod_x`: `num % x` (the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`).
- `mod_y`: `num % y` (the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`).
- `required_mod_x`: `(x - (num % x)) % x` (the required remainder for `x` to make `num` a multiple of `x`).
- `required_mod_y`: `mod_y` (the same as `mod_y`).
- `num`: The next element in `a`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Values to Be Printed:
- `num`: The current number being processed from the array `a`.
- `mod_x`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x`: The value `(x - (num % x)) % x`, which represents the additional amount needed to make `num` a multiple of `x`.
- `required_mod_y`: This is the same as `mod_y`.

### Explanation:
For each number `num` in the array `a`, the following calculations are performed:
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is the additional value needed to make `num` a multiple of `x`. It is calculated as `(x - (num % x)) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

### Example Output:
Assume `num = 7`, `x = 3`, and `y = 4`.
- `mod_x = 7 % 3 = 1`
- `mod_y = 7 % 4 = 3`
- `required_mod_x = (3 - (7 % 3)) % 3 = (3 - 1) % 3 = 2`
- `required_mod_y = mod_y = 3`

Thus, the output would be:
Output: **Number: 7, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 3, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 3**

However, since the exact values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (num % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [num % y] (where num is the current element in the array a, x and y are parameters from the test case)**
