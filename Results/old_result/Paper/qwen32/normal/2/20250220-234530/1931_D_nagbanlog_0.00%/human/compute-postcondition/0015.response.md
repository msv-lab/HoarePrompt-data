Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists as a key in the `freq` dictionary, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**
