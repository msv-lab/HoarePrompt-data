To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases`: A list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`.
- `results`: A list that stores the final `beautiful_count` for each test case.
- `case`: The current test case being processed, which is a dictionary containing:
  - `'params'`: A tuple `(n, x, y)`.
  - `'array'`: A list `a` of integers.
- `n`: The first element of `case['params']`, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `x`: The second element of `case['params']`, used to compute the modulo for elements in `a`.
- `y`: The third element of `case['params']`, also used to compute the modulo for elements in `a`.
- `a`: The array of integers from `case['array']`.
- `freq`: A dictionary that counts occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs, where `mod_x` is the result of `element % x` and `mod_y` is the result of `element % y` for each element in `a`.
- `beautiful_count`: A counter that keeps track of the number of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop execution.

### Code Execution Context:
The `print` statement is executed after the processing of a test case, specifically after calculating the `beautiful_count` for that test case.

### Explanation of `beautiful_count`:
- `beautiful_count` is incremented based on the number of times specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs appear in the `freq` dictionary.
- The exact value of `beautiful_count` depends on the contents of `a`, the values of `x` and `y`, and how many times each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair appears in `freq`.

### Final Output:
Given the above context, the `print` statement will output the `beautiful_count` for the current test case.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total number of pairs (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) found in freq during the loop execution for the current test case)**
