To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`test_cases`**: A list containing at least one test case. Each test case is a tuple \((n, x, y, a)\) with the following constraints:
   - \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\)
   - \(a\) is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
3. **`results`**: An empty list that will presumably store results of the test cases.
4. **`n`, `x`, and `y`**: These are values extracted from `case['params']` of a specific test case.
5. **`a`**: This is the list of integers extracted from `case['array']` of the same test case.
6. **`freq`**: An empty dictionary that might be used to count frequencies of elements in `a`.
7. **`beautiful_count`**: An integer initialized to 0, likely used to count "beautiful" elements in `a`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string that includes the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` for a specific test case. Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of their roles and constraints.

### Explanation of the Output:
- **`n`**: The number of elements in the array `a` for the current test case.
- **`x`**: An integer parameter for the current test case.
- **`y`**: Another integer parameter for the current test case.
- **`a`**: The list of integers for the current test case.

Given the constraints and the nature of the variables, the output will be a string that includes these values. The exact numerical values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` depend on the specific test case being processed.

### Final Output:
Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n is the number of elements in the array, x and y are integer parameters, and a is the list of integers for the current test case)**
