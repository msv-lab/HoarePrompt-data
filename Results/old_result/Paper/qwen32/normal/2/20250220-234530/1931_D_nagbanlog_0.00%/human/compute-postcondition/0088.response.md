The code snippet appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list will now include the `beautiful_count` from the current test case. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered, `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs found. The `results` list now includes the `beautiful_count` from the current test case.**
