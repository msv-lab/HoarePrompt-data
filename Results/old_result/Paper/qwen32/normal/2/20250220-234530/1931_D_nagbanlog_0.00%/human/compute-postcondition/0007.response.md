To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `num` in `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element so that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head is `for num in a:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must contain at least one element.
3. The current state mentions that `a` is a list of integers from `case['array']`. To ensure the loop executes, `case['array']` must contain at least one integer.
4. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given this, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `a` (which is `case['array']`) has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0**
