The code calculates `required_mod_x` using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. Given that `mod_x` is already calculated as `n % x`, the new variable `required_mod_x` is derived from this.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` remain the values extracted from `case['params']`.
- `a` remains the list of integers from `case['array']`.
- `freq` remains an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` remains 0.
- `mod_x` remains `n % x`.
- `mod_y` remains `n % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is now `(x - mod_x) % x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**
