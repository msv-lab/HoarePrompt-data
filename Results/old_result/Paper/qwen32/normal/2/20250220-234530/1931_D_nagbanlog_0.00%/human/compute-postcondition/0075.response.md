To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `num`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a)
- `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count` which is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element
- `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, and includes the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 0 if it was not already present
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `num % y`
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`
- `num` is the next element in `a`
- `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` would have been the current element from the list `a`. For the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `num` as the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a); `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count` which is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`; `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`; `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element; `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, and includes the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 0 if it was not already present; `num` is the next element in `a`**
