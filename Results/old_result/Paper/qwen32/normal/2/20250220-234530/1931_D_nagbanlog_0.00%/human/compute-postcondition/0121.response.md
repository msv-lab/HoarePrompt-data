The code snippet calculates `mod_y` which is `num % y`. This means the value of `mod_y` will be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**
