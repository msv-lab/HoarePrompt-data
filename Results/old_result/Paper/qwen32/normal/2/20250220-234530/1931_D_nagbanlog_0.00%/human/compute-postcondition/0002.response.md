The given code snippet unpacks the values from a dictionary `case` into the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The variable `a` is not unpacked in this snippet, and `results` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, and `results` is an empty list. Each test case in `test_cases` is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)` with specific constraints on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the elements of `a`.

After executing the line `n, x, y = case['params']`, the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will be assigned the values from the `params` key of the `case` dictionary. The variable `a` is not modified by this line, and `results` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `x`, and `y` as extracted from the `case` dictionary, while `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` retain their original states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`.**
