The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to reflect the next element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`.
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element.
- `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `mod_x` is `n % x`.
- `mod_y` is `n % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
- `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `num` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Let's assume that during the previous iteration, `num` was the `k`-th element of `a`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `num` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.
