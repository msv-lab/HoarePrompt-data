To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a). Each test case contains four elements:
  - `n`: the first element of the tuple, representing the size of the array.
  - `x`: the second element of the tuple, representing some parameter.
  - `y`: the third element of the tuple, representing another parameter.
  - `a`: the fourth element of the tuple, representing the array itself.
- `results` is a list that will store the final `beautiful_count` for each test case.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`. It is assumed that `case` is a dictionary with keys `'params'` and `'array'`.
  - `case['params']` is a tuple containing `(n, x, y)`.
  - `case['array']` is the array `a`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from `case['params']`.
- `a` is directly extracted from `case['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary used for counting frequencies (not relevant to this specific print statement).
- `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0 (also not relevant to this specific print statement).

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

We need to substitute the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` into the string. Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` depend on the specific test case being processed, we can describe them in terms of the current test case.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n, x, y, and a are the values from the current test case in test_cases)**
