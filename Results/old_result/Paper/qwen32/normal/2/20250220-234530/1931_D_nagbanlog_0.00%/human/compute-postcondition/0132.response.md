The given code snippet appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified directly by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the `beautiful_count` is a variable that holds the total number of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in the `freq` dictionary during the loop execution. This value is appended to the `results` list.

Since no other variables are changed, the only change in the output state is that `results` now includes the `beautiful_count` from the current test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total number of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop execution.**
