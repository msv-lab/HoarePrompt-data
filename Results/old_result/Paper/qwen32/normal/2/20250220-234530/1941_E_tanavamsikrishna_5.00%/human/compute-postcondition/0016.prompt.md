You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Elements at indices 0 to d-2 in `row` are each incremented by d-1, and elements at indices d-1 and beyond remain unchanged.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Elements at indices 0 to d-2 are incremented by d-1. For each index i from d-1 to the end of the list, row[i] is updated to min(row[max(0, i-(d+1)):i]) + row[i] + 1.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the value at the last index of the list `row` after the specified operations have been performed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `row`, which is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. After performing specified operations, the function returns the value at the last index of the list `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value at the last index of the list `row` after the specified operations have been performed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
