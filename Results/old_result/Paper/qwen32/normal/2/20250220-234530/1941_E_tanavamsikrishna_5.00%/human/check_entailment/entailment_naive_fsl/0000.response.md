Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. Let's break down the issues:

### Issues in `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally according to the problem constraints.
- Specifically, the loop `for i in range(0, d - 1):` incorrectly adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements without considering the optimal placement of supports.
- The loop `for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):` attempts to find the minimum cost up to the previous `d` elements, but it does not guarantee that the supports are placed optimally or within the required distance `d`.

### Issues in `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` reads the input and calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, but it does not handle the requirement that the bridges must be built on consecutive rows.
- The calculation of `total_costs` sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows, but it does not ensure that the supports in these rows are placed optimally according to the problem constraints.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
Expected Output: `8`

Explanation:
- For the first row, the optimal placement of supports could be at positions 1, 3, and 5 with a cost of `0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.
- For the second row, the optimal placement of supports could be at positions 1, 3, and 5 with a cost of `0 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 5`.
- For the third row, the optimal placement of supports could be at positions 1, 3, and 5 with a cost of `0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4`.
- The minimum total cost for building bridges on two consecutive rows would be `4 + 5 = 9` or `5 + 4 = 9`, but the optimal solution is `8` which can be achieved by placing supports differently.

The provided program does not handle the optimal placement of supports correctly, leading to incorrect results in many cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
