### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to see if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost of placing supports on a single row of the river grid according to the rules provided.
- **Logic**:
  - For the first `d-1` elements of the row, it simply increments each element by 1.
  - For the remaining elements, it finds the minimum cost among the previous `d` elements (excluding the current one) and adds the current element's depth plus 1.
  - Finally, it returns the cost of the last element in the row, which represents the total cost of placing supports in that row under the given constraints.

However, there seems to be an issue with the implementation of `func_1`. The way it calculates the minimum cost for elements beyond the first `d-1` is incorrect. Specifically, the slicing and indexing logic needs to ensure that it considers the correct range of previous elements when calculating the minimum cost. The current implementation might not handle the edge cases correctly, especially when `i` is close to the boundaries of the row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then determines the minimum total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance (`d`).
  - It then reads the grid of river depths.
  - For each row, it calculates the cost using `func_1`.
  - It computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.

Given the potential issues with `func_1`, the overall correctness of the program is questionable. Specifically, the incorrect calculation of the minimum cost in `func_1` could lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct results due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

**Correctness: False**
