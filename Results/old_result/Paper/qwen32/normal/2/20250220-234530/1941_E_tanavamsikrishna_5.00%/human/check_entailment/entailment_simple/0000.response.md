### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and its logic against the problem requirements.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum cost of placing supports on a single row of the river grid.
- **Logic**:
  - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1. This ensures that there is a support at the start (index 0) and at least `d-1` additional supports within the first `d-1` cells.
  - The second loop calculates the cost for each subsequent cell from index `d-1` to the end of the row. For each cell at index `i`, it finds the minimum cost among the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell itself) and adds the depth of the current cell plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
  - Finally, it returns the cost at the last index of the row, which represents the total minimum cost for placing supports on that row.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- **Purpose**: To find the minimum total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river grid.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - It reads the `n` rows of the grid into a 2D list `rows`.
  - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports on that row, storing these costs in the list `costs`.
  - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the corresponding costs from `costs`. These sums are stored in `total_costs`.
  - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which represents the minimum total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for placing supports on a single row according to the problem constraints.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by considering all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and selecting the one with the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
