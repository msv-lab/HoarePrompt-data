Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Problem Understanding
The task is to find the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges over consecutive rows in a grid representing a river. Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column, with supports placed at certain positions according to specific rules:
- Supports must be placed in the first and last columns.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
- The cost of placing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Program Breakdown

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and calculates the cumulative cost of placing supports while adhering to the distance constraint `d`.
   - The function returns the total cost for the row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`).
   - Reads the grid of depths.
   - For each row, it computes the cost using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_1`**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost of placing supports in a row while adhering to the distance constraint `d`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` seems to assume a fixed pattern of placing supports which does not necessarily minimize the cost.
   - It should use dynamic programming or another approach to ensure the minimum cost is found while respecting the constraints.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k` equals `n`, meaning all rows must be used to build bridges.
   - It also doesn't handle cases where the optimal placement of supports might involve skipping certain columns within a row.

3. **Efficiency Concerns**:
   - Given the constraints, especially the large value of `m` (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)), the current implementation of `func_1` might not be efficient enough.
   - The nested loops in `func_1` could lead to time complexity issues.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges over consecutive rows while adhering to the constraints. The main issue lies in the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, which is responsible for calculating the cost of placing supports in a single row.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
