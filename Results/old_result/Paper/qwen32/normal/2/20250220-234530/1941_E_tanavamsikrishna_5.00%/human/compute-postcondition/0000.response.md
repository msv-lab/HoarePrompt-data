The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. This means that the initial values of these variables are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` already have specific roles and constraints. After executing the code snippet, these variables will hold the new values provided by the input, while the constraints remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values read from the input.**
