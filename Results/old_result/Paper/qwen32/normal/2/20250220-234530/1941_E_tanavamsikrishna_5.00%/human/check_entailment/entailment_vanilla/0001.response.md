Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid.
- Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column.
- The cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- Supports must be placed in the first and last columns.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

### Key Points:
1. **Cost Calculation**: For each row, we need to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. **Consecutive Rows**: After calculating the cost for each row individually, we need to find the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row.
- It iterates through the row and uses dynamic programming to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.
- The logic seems correct for calculating the minimum cost for a single row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- Reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- Reads the grid of depths.
- Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row.
- Iterates through the calculated costs to find the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows.
- Prints the result.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The `func_1` function incorrectly calculates the cost for placing supports. It does not properly account for the requirement that supports must be placed in the first and last columns and that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The current implementation does not ensure that supports are placed in the first and last columns, which is a critical requirement.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the first and last columns always have supports and that the distance constraint is respected.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of the constraints related to placing supports in the first and last columns and ensuring the distance constraint, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
