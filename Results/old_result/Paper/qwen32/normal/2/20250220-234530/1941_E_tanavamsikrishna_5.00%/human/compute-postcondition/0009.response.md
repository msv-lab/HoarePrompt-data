The given code appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Specifically, it calculates the sum of elements from index `i` to `i + k` in the `costs` list and adds this sum to the `total_costs` list.

Given the initial state, `i` is already defined as `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `x + 1 < n - k + 1`. This means `i` is a valid index to start a slice of length `k` within the `costs` list.

After executing the line `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`, the `total_costs` list will have one additional element, which is the sum of the slice `costs[i:i + k]`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` for all previously considered slices, plus the newly appended sum `sum(costs[i:i + k])`, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < n - k + 1`.**
