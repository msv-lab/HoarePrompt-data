Output State: **t is incremented by 1, n remains the first integer from the input, m is 2, a1 is the first integer from the new input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, a2 is the first integer from the latest input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding those equal to a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding those equal to a1, if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is an empty list. Furthermore, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
