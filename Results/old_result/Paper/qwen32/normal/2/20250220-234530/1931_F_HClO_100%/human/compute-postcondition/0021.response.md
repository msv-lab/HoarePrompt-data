The `continue` statement in Python is used within loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect here. Therefore, none of the variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, and `l11` is not equal to `l22`.**
