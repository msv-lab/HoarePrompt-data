Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input unless it was 2 and `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` was not -1, in which case `m` is decremented by 1. `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a list containing elements from the latest input with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the latest input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. If `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, and `l` is a list containing the same elements as `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `n - 2`, and `l` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`, `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged. `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**
