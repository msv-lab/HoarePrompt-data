Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is set to 2.
- `a1` is the first integer from the new input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- `a2` is the first integer from the latest input.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`.
- `idx1` and `idx2` have specific conditions:
  - If `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`.
  - Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged.
  - `idx1` is not less than `idx2`.
  - `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.
- `p1` is set to 0.
- `p2` is set to 0.
- `val` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val`.

Output: **yes**
