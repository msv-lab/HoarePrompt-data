To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is `i` and `n`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `(n - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 1. This implies that `n` must be at least 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `a1` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`.
- `idx1` is -1.
- `idx2` is -1.
- `p1` is 0.
- `p2` is 0.

We need to adjust `n` to ensure that `n - 1` is at least 1, which means `n` should be at least 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` must be at least 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0**
