The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the list `val`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`. Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `val`, after processing one tuple, the next iteration should process the next tuple in the list.

Here's how we can adjust the state:

- The current tuple `(a3, l3)` has been processed, so the next tuple in `val` should be the new `(a3, l3)` for the next iteration.
- Since `val` is a list of tuples and we are iterating over it, the next iteration will automatically take the next tuple from `val`.

Given that `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, after processing one tuple, there should still be tuples left in `val` for the loop to continue unless all tuples have been processed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple in `val`.

State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. The current `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`.**
