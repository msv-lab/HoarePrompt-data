The `print('no')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'no'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- The `print('no')` statement directly outputs the string `'no'`.
- None of the variables `n`, `m`, `t`, `val`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, or `l3` affect the output of this particular print statement because they are not referenced within it.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **no**
