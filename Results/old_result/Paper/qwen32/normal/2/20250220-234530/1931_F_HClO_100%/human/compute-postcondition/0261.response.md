The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and proceeds to the next iteration without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `m`, `t`, `val`, `p1`, or `p2` are modified by the `continue` statement. The loop continues, and the print statement 'yes' will execute again in the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by 1 compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the loop prints 'yes'**.
