Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
