The code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to `l1`. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged unless `m` was initially 1, in which case it stays 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is 1, then `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
