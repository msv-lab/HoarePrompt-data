Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 2 (since the if condition `m == 2` is true), `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list. If `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` was not -1, then both `idx1` and `idx2` are updated to `n - 2`. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
