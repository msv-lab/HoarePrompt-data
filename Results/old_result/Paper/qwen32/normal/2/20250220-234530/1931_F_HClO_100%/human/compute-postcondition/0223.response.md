The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that the element currently at `idx2` and all subsequent elements will be shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of integers excluding those equal to `a2`. After the insertion, `l1` will have `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `m == 2` and `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list. Furthermore, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In simpler terms, `a1` has been inserted into `l1` at the position `idx2`, shifting all elements from `idx2` onwards one position to the right. All other variables remain unchanged.
