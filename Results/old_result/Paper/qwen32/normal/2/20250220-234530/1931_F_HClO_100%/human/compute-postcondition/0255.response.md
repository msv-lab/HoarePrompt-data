Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `val` contains the remaining tuples `(a3, l3)`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the current `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing `a3` from `l`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
