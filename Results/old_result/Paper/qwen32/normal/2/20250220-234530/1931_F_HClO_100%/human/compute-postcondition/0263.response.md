The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, assigns the first integer to `a1`, and the rest to `l1`. This means that `a1` will take the value of the first integer from the input, and `l1` will be a list containing the remaining integers.

Given the initial state, the only variables that will be affected are `a1` and `l1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `t`, `val`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and the loop's print statement ('yes') also remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by 1 compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
