Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. The current `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
