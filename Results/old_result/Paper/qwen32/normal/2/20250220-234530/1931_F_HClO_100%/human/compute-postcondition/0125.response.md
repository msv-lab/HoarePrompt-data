The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the list `val`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the second tuple in the list. This means that in the previous iteration, `(a3, l3)` referred to the second tuple in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `(a3, l3)` should now refer to the third tuple in the list.

State: **`val` is a list containing at least three tuples, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the third tuple in the list.**
