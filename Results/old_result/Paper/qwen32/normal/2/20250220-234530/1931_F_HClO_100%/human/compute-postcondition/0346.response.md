The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables unless those variables are explicitly modified within the skipped section of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, none of the variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `val`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`) are modified by the `continue` statement itself. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is 2, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration (which means `t` remains unchanged since `m - 2` is 0), `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations. If `idx2` is `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx2` remains unchanged. If `idx1` is `-1` and `idx2` is not `-1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains `-1`. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. Furthermore, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
