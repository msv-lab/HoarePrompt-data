Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3). If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, indicating that both `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` have been true at some point, leading to `p1` being 1 and `p2` being 0, with `idx1` set to `i` and `idx2` set to -1, or vice versa. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` unless `l1[i + p1] == a2`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` is less than 0 or `idx2` is less than 0, no changes are made to the variables other than potentially breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
