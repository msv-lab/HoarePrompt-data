Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to -1, `p1` is set to 1, and `p2` is set to 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is set to -1, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 0, and `p2` is set to 1. Additionally, if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
