Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing any of the variable values. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and states.
