The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. This means `l` now holds the same list that `l1` holds. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration, `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l2` is unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations, `idx1` is greater than `idx2` and remains unchanged, `idx2` remains unchanged, `l` is equal to `l1`.**
