Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the second tuple in the list. If `l3` is not equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the control continues as per the subsequent code after the if-else block.**
