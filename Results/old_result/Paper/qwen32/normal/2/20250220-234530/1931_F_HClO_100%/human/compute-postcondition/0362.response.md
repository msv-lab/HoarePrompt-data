The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that `val` now includes this new tuple. The values of `n`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged except for the modification to `val`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`**.
