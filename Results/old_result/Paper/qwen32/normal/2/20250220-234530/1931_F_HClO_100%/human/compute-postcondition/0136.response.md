The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to `l1`. This means `a1` will hold the first integer from the input, and `l1` will be a list containing the remaining integers.

Given the initial state, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `t` is incremented by 1. Since the code does not affect `n` or `m`, they retain their original values. The loop condition and the print statement ('yes') also remain unaffected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `t` is incremented by 1. `n` remains the first integer from the input. `m` remains the second integer from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
