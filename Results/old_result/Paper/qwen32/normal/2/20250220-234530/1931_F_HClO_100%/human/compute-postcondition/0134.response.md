The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables unless there is additional code within the loop that modifies them. Given the initial state, since the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes', and `t` is incremented by 1, the `continue` statement does not alter these conditions or the values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes', `t` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
