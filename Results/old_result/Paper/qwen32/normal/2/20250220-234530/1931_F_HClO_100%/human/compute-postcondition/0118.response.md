Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- **Initial State:**
  - `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`.
  - The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('no')
  ```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply outputs the string `'no'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the values of `val`, `a3`, `l3`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output will always be `'no'` regardless of the values of `a3`, `l3`, or the list `l`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
