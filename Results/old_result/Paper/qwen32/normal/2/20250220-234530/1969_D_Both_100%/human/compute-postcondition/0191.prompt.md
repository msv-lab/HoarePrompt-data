Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: heap contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` may or may not be empty; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `item`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged; if `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements), excluding the smallest element, and including `item`; `combined` is either empty or contains the original elements minus the last one; `item` holds the value of the last element that was in `combined`; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `removed_item` remain unchanged; `current_profit` remains unchanged; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` contains the last `k` elements of `combined` (excluding the smallest element and the popped item) plus `item`, excluding the smallest element among them; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was added; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `combined` is missing its last element; `heap` includes `item` and the smallest item is now `removed_item`; `removed_item` is the smallest item in the heap after pushing `item`; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]` and further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. Specifically, if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
