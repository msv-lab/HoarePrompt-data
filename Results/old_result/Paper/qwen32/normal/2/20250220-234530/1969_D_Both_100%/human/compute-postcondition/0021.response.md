Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty, now it contains the tuple that was the second-to-last in `combined` after popping if `combined` was non-empty. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and now has one less tuple if it was non-empty. `test_cases` must be greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.**
