The given Python code snippet uses `heapq.heappushpop` to push `item` onto `heap` and then pop the smallest element from the heap. This operation updates `heap` and assigns the popped element to `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, here's the output state:

- `heap` originally contains `item` and the smallest element has been removed. After `heapq.heappushpop`, `item` is pushed onto `heap`, and then the smallest element (which could be `item` itself or another element) is popped and assigned to `removed_item`. Therefore, `heap` now contains all the original elements except the smallest one, plus `item`.
- `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was just popped from the heap.
- `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, and `combined` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `heapq.heappushpop` operation.
- `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` and is now part of `heap`.
- The condition for `current_profit` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify `current_profit`.

Output State: **`heap` contains all the original elements except the smallest one, plus `item`; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was just popped from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty but has one less element; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`.**
