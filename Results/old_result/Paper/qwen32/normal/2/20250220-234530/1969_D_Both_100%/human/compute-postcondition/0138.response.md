The code snippet creates a new list called `combined` by zipping together the `neg_prices` and `bonuses` lists. This means that each element in `combined` will be a tuple consisting of corresponding elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`.

Given the initial state, `combined` is initially an empty list. After executing the code, `combined` will contain tuples of elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **heap is an empty list; removed_item holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration; n is the first value returned by `func_2()`; k is the second value returned by `func_2()`; prices is the list returned by `func_2()`; neg_prices is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`; bonuses is the list returned by `func_2()`; test_cases is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains corresponding elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`; item is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration; current_profit is 0; max_profit is 0; remaining_items is an empty list.**
