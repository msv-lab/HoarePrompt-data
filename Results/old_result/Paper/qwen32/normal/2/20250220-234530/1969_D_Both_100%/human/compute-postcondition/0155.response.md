Output State: **heap contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` may or may not be empty; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `item`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged; if `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
