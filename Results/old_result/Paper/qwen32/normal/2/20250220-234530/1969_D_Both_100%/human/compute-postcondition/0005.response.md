The given code snippet updates the `prices` list by assigning it the list returned by `func_2()`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for items, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, and the `combined` list is sorted based on the bonus values; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language: The `prices` list is now updated to the list returned by `func_2()`. All other variables retain their initial values.
