Postcondition: **`heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed; `combined` is not empty except for one less element; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`); `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` before the pop operation; if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. Additionally, if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]` once more. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
