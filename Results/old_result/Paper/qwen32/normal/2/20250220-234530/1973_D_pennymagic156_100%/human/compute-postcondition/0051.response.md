To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code `l = func_2() + 1` on the given initial state.

- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `n` must be at least 3 (unchanged)
- `k` is 2 (unchanged)
- `v` remains unchanged (unchanged)
- `cnt` is 1 (unchanged)
- `l` must be less than 4 (before execution)

After executing `l = func_2() + 1`, the new value of `l` will be `func_2() + 1`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the context, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `l` will be updated to this new value, and it must still satisfy the condition `l < 4`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 1, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4.**
