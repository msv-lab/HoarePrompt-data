To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it terminates.

The loop iterates from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. In each iteration, it prints a query and updates `v` with the result of `func_2()`. If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = n`.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i > 0`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.
3. **Termination**: The loop terminates either when `v` equals `n` (in which case `v` is set to `i` and the loop breaks) or when `i` reaches 0.

### Final Output State:
- If `v` never equals `n` during any iteration, the loop will run until `i` becomes 0.
- If `v` equals `n` at some point, the loop breaks, and `v` is set to the value of `i` at that point.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop completes all iterations without `v` ever being equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, and `v` will remain the last value returned by `func_2()` that was not equal to `n`.
- If the loop breaks because `v` equals `n`, `v` will be set to the value of `i` at that point, and `i` will be the value just before the break.

Since the problem does not specify the exact behavior of `func_2()`, we can only describe the general final states based on these conditions.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
If the loop completes all iterations without breaking:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `v` is the last value returned by `func_2()` that was not equal to `n`, `n` and `k` remain unchanged.**

If the loop breaks because `v` equals `n`:
Output State: **`v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n`, `i` is the value just before the break, `n` and `k` remain unchanged.**

However, since the question asks for the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, and considering the loop may break early, the most precise and general answer is:

Output State: **`i` is 0 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value just before the break; `v` is the last value returned by `func_2()` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n`; `n` and `k` remain unchanged.**
