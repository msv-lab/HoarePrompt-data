To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least `k + 1`
   - `k` remains unchanged
   - `v` remains unchanged
   - `cnt` is `k`
   - `l` is 1
   - The loop condition is that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `cnt` is not 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - Prints `? {l} {i * v}`
   - Updates `l` to `func_2() + 1`
   - Decrements `cnt` by 1

4. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - **After 1st iteration**:
     - `cnt` becomes `k - 1`
     - `l` becomes `func_2() + 1`
   - **After 2nd iteration**:
     - `cnt` becomes `0`
     - `l` becomes `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `4` (implying `n` is at least 3).
   - **After 3rd iteration**:
     - `cnt` is non-zero and decreased by 1
     - `l` becomes `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `4`.

From the above, we can infer that `k` is 2 because after 2 iterations, `cnt` becomes 0, indicating that `k` was initially 2. Also, `n` must be at least 3 because `l` must be less than 4 after 2 iterations.

Since `cnt` becomes 0 after the second iteration, the loop will terminate after the second iteration. Therefore, the final state will be the state after the second iteration.

**Final Output State**:
- `i` remains 2
- `n` must be at least 3
- `k` remains 2
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `i` is still 2, `n` must be at least 3, `k` remains 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0 (indicating the loop has terminated), and `l` is `func_2() + 1` but must be less than 4.
