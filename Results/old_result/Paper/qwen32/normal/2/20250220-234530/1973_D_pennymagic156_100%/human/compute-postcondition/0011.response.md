To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and its impact on the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
v = func_2()
```

This line assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value that `v` will take. However, we can describe the state in terms of what has changed and what remains the same.

The initial state is:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `i-1`.
- `v` is `i-1` if `v` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, otherwise `v` remains unchanged.

After executing `v = func_2()`, the value of `v` changes to whatever `func_2()` returns. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is `i-1`; `v` is the return value of `func_2()`.**
