To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 3 (but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `k` is 2 (but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `v` remains unchanged (its value is not specified but it will be used in the print statement).
- `cnt` must be non-zero (but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `l`:**
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - We know that `l` must be less than 4, so `func_2() + 1 < 4` implies `func_2() < 3`.
   - Since `func_2()` returns a value that is less than 3, `l` could be 1, 2, or 3.
   - Without the exact definition of `func_2()`, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`, but we know it is one of these three values.

2. **Expression `i * v`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `v` remains unchanged, but its value is not provided.
   - Therefore, `i * v` will be `2 * v`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the output will be in the form `? l (1, 2, or 3) 2*v`, where `v` is the value of the variable `v`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [l] [2*v] (where l is func_2() + 1 and must be 1, 2, or 3, and v is the value of the variable v)**
