The code snippet reassigns the value of `l` to `func_2() + 1`. Since `l` was initially defined as `func_2() + 1`, reassigning it does not change its value. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
