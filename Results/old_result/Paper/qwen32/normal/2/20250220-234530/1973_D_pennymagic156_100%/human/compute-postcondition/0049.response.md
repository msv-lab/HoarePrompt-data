To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The `while` loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as both `cnt` is truthy (non-zero) and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2 (not part of the loop condition)
- `n` must be at least `k + 1` (part of the loop condition)
- `k` must be non-zero (affects `cnt`)
- `v` remains unchanged (not part of the loop condition)
- `cnt` is `k - 1` (part of the loop condition)
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` (part of the loop condition)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`cnt` Condition:**
   - The loop requires `cnt` to be truthy (non-zero).
   - Given `cnt` is `k - 1`, for `cnt` to be non-zero, `k` must be at least 2 (since `k` must be non-zero already).

2. **`l < n + 1` Condition:**
   - The loop requires `l` to be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `n` must be at least `k + 1`, we need to ensure `func_2() + 1 < k + 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- Since `k` must be at least 2 for `cnt` to be non-zero, let's set `k = 2`.
- With `k = 2`, `cnt` becomes `k - 1 = 1` (which is non-zero).
- `n` must be at least `k + 1 = 3`.
- For `l < n + 1` to hold true, `l` must be less than `4` (`n + 1` when `n = 3`). Given `l = func_2() + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value less than `3`.

Since we cannot control the exact value returned by `func_2()`, we can only specify that `l` must be less than `4` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 1, `l` must be less than 4**
