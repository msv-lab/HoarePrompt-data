The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `cnt` was initially non-zero, after decrementing, it remains non-zero but its specific value is reduced by 1. The other conditions and values such as `i` being 2, `n` being at least 3, `k` being 2, `v` remaining unchanged, and `l` being `func_2() + 1` and less than 4, still hold true.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is non-zero and decreased by 1, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4**.
