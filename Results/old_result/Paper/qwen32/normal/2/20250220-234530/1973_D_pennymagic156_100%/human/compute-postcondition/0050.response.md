Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified.
- `k` is explicitly set to 2, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `v` remains unchanged, but its exact value is not specified.
- `cnt` is explicitly set to 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `l` must be less than 4, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Breaking down the components inside the print statement:
- `?` is a literal character.
- `{l}` will be replaced by the value of the variable `l`.
- `{i * v}` will be replaced by the result of the multiplication of `i` and `v`.

Given that `i` is 2 and `v` remains unchanged but its value is unknown, we can express the output in terms of `l` and `v`:
- `i * v` will be `2 * v`.

Therefore, the output will be a string starting with `?`, followed by the value of `l`, a space, and then the result of `2 * v`.

Output: **? [l] [2 * v] (where l is a value less than 4 and v is the unchanged value of v)**
