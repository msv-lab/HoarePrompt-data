To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_2()` does. However, since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables `i`, `v`, `n`, and `k`. 

Given that no details about `func_2()` are provided, we can only assume that it might modify one or more of these variables or perform some operations without affecting them. Since there's no information on what `func_2()` does, we'll assume that it does not alter the values of `i`, `v`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output state would be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n // k + 1`, `v` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged.**
