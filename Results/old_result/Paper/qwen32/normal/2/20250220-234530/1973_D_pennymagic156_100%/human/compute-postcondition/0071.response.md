To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
l = func_2() + 1
```

This line of code assigns the value of `func_2()` plus 1 to the variable `l`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `l` must be less than 6 according to the precondition.

Given that `l` is being updated to `func_2() + 1`, the new value of `l` will be whatever `func_2()` returns plus 1. Let's denote the return value of `func_2()` as `X`. Therefore, `l` will be `X + 1`.

Since `l` must be less than 6, `X + 1 < 6`, which implies `X < 5`. So, `X` could be any value from negative infinity up to 4 (inclusive).

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 1, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than 5**.
