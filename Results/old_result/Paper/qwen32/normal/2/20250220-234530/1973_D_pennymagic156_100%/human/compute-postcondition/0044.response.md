Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least `k + 1`, `k` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The variables `i`, `n`, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged. The variable `cnt` is updated to the value of `k`, and `l` is set to 1. The condition "either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`" is still valid because `cnt` is now `k` (which is not 0) and `l` is 1.
