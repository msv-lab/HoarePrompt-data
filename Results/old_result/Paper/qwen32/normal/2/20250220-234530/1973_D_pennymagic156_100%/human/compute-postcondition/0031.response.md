The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is `k - 1`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `(k - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `k - 2`.

The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.**
