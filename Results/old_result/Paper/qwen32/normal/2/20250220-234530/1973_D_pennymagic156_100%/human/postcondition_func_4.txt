The function `func_5` takes no direct input parameters but internally retrieves two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4) from another function `func_3`. It performs a series of operations involving interactions with other functions (`func_2`) and prints specific queries and results based on these interactions. Ultimately, it either prints a result in the form of `! <value>` or `! -1` and does not return any value.
