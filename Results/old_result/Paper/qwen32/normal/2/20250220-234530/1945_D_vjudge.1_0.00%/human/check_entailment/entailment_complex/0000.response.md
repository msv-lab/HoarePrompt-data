### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people and wants to move to one of the first `m` positions.
- To move, Kirill can swap places with someone in front of him, paying `a_i` coins to swap directly with the `i-th` person.
- Additionally, for each person between the swapped positions, Kirill must pay `b_k` coins to each person `k` such that `j < k < i`.

#### Approach in the Code:
1. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This is done to simplify the logic of moving Kirill towards the front by iterating from the back of the queue.
2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `pref` accumulates the cost of optimal swaps up to a certain point.
   - `soma_b` accumulates the cost of passing through people during swaps.
3. **Iterating through the Queue**:
   - For the first part of the queue (up to `n-k`), it decides whether to swap directly (`lista_A[i]`) or to accumulate passing-through costs (`lista_B[i]`).
   - For the last `k` positions, it calculates the minimum cost to reach any of these positions by adding the accumulated costs and the direct swap cost.
4. **Output**: The minimum cost to reach any of the first `m` positions is printed.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the code with the first example from the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Processing:**
- Reverse `lista_A` and `lista_B`: `lista_A = [9, 6, 3, 7]`, `lista_B = [5, 8, 3, 4]`.
- For `i = 0` to `i = 1` (since `n - k = 2`):
  - At `i = 0`, `lista_A[0] = 9` > `lista_B[0] = 5`, so `soma_b += 5`.
  - At `i = 1`, `lista_A[1] = 6` > `lista_B[1] = 8`, so `soma_b += 8`.
- For `i = 2` to `i = 3`:
  - At `i = 2`, `resultado = min(inf, 0 + 13 + 3) = 16`.
  - At `i = 3`, `resultado = min(16, 13 + 11 + 7) = 14`.
- Output: `14`.

This matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The approach is efficient and handles the constraints appropriately.
