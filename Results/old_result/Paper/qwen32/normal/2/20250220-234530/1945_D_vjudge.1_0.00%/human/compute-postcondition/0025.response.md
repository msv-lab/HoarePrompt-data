Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `soma_b` is the previous value of `soma_b` plus the value of `lista_B[i]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `soma_b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` of `lista_B`. All other variables retain their previous values.
