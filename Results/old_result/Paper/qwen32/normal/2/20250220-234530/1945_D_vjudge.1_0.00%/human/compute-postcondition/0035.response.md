To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = n - k` to `i < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already `n - 1`, incrementing it would make `i` equal to `n`, which would cause the loop to terminate.

Therefore, there is no valid state where the loop can execute another iteration because `i` would exceed the range specified by `n - k` to `n`.

However, if we assume that the question is asking for the state just before the loop terminates (which is the state right after the last valid iteration), then:

- `i` would be `n - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Since `pref`, `soma_b`, and `resultado` are not part of the loop head and are not directly affected by the loop's iteration control, they remain as they are at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of what would be the next iteration (but is actually the termination point) is:

State: **`pref` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_A` and `soma_b` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_B` after all iterations including the current `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[i]`; `resultado` is the minimum of its previous value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - 1]`; `n` must be greater than `k`; `i` is `n - 1`**

But since the loop cannot execute another iteration, this is the final state where the loop terminates.
