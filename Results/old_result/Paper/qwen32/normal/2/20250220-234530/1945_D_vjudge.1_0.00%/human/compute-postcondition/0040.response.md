Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `k`, an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill such that 1 <= k <= n; and two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, each containing `n` integers. The function calculates and returns the minimum total cost Kirill has to pay to move to a position no later than `k` in the queue, considering the costs specified in `lista_A` for direct swaps and `lista_B` for indirect swaps involving other people.**
