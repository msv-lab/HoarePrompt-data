The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still satisfy the condition `i < n - k`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 2`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` and `soma_b` is 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is `soma_b + lista_B[i]`.**

However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of only adjusting the objects in the loop head, we should only change `i`:

State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**
