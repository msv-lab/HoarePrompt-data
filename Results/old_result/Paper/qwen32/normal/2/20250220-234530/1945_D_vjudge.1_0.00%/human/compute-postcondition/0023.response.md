Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `pref` is updated to include the element at index `i` of `lista_A`. The values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1 and `pref` which now includes the additional value from `lista_A[i]`.
