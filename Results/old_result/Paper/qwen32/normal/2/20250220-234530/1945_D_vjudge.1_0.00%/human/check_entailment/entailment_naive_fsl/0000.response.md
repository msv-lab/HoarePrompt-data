Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people.
- He can bribe people to swap positions, paying `a_j` coins to swap with the `j-th` person and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position.
- The goal is to minimize the total number of coins spent.

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's focus on `func_1()`:
- It reads `n` and `m` (where `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
- It reads two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, representing the costs `a_i` and `b_i`.
- The lists are reversed.
- It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions using a prefix sum approach.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Reversing Lists**: Reversing the lists (`lista_A` and `lista_B`) does not align with the problem's requirement. The problem states that Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only bribe people in front of him. Reversing the lists changes the order of people in the queue, which is incorrect.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost seems flawed. The code attempts to calculate the minimum cost using a prefix sum approach, but it doesn't correctly account for the fact that Kirill can make multiple swaps and the cost associated with each swap.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
Expected Output: `14`

Explanation:
- Kirill can swap with the 2nd person (cost `3`), then with the 1st person (cost `7`), spending a total of `10` coins.
- Alternatively, he can swap directly with the 1st person (cost `7`), then with the 2nd person (cost `3`), spending a total of `10` coins.
- The minimum cost is `10`.

However, the provided code might not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

#### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
