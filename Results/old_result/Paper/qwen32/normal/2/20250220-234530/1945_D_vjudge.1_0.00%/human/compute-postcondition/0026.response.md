Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is updated to `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` and `soma_b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is updated to the previous value of `soma_b` plus the value of `lista_B[i]`.**
