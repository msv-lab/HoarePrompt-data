You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people.
- He can bribe people to swap positions, paying `a_j` coins to swap with the `j-th` person and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position.
- The goal is to minimize the total number of coins spent.

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's focus on `func_1()`:
- It reads `n` and `m` (where `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
- It reads two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, representing the costs `a_i` and `b_i`.
- The lists are reversed.
- It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions using a prefix sum approach.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Reversing Lists**: Reversing the lists (`lista_A` and `lista_B`) does not align with the problem's requirement. The problem states that Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only bribe people in front of him. Reversing the lists changes the order of people in the queue, which is incorrect.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost seems flawed. The code attempts to calculate the minimum cost using a prefix sum approach, but it doesn't correctly account for the fact that Kirill can make multiple swaps and the cost associated with each swap.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
Expected Output: `14`

Explanation:
- Kirill can swap with the 2nd person (cost `3`), then with the 1st person (cost `7`), spending a total of `10` coins.
- Alternatively, he can swap directly with the 1st person (cost `7`), then with the 2nd person (cost `3`), spending a total of `10` coins.
- The minimum cost is `10`.

However, the provided code might not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

#### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
