### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. Kirill can swap positions with people ahead of him, paying `a_i` coins to swap with the `i-th` person and `b_k` coins to each person between his current position and the `i-th` person.

The solution involves iterating through the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` in reverse order, calculating the cumulative costs (`soma_b`) and the potential minimum cost (`pref`). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reverse the Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This allows us to process the queue from the back to the front, making it easier to calculate the cumulative costs for swaps.

2. **Calculate Cumulative Costs**:
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `n-k-1`:
     - If `lista_A[i]` (cost to swap with the `i-th` person) is less than `lista_B[i]` (cost to pass through the `i-th` person), we add the accumulated `soma_b` to `pref` and then add `lista_A[i]` to `pref`. We reset `soma_b` to `0` because we've effectively swapped positions and no longer need to account for passing through these people.
     - Otherwise, we add `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b` because we're considering passing through this person without swapping.

3. **Determine Minimum Cost**:
   - Initialize `resultado` to infinity.
   - For each position `i` from `n-k` to `n-1`:
     - Calculate the potential cost as `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` and update `resultado` if this is the minimum cost encountered so far.
     - Add `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b` to account for passing through this person in subsequent iterations.

4. **Output the Result**: After processing all positions, the minimum cost stored in `resultado` is printed.

### Analysis:

The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering all possible swaps and passes through the queue. The use of cumulative sums (`soma_b`) and prefix sums (`pref`) ensures that the solution is efficient, even for large inputs.

Given the constraints (up to 200,000 people in the queue and up to 10,000 test cases), the time complexity of the solution is O(n) per test case, which is efficient enough.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the logic outlined above.
