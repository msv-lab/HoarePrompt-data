To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the given problem, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the requirements and constraints described in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
- Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- To move, he can swap with any person in front of him, paying `a_j` coins to the person he swaps with and `b_k` coins to each person between them.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the code to understand its approach:

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads `n` and `k` (where `k` corresponds to `m` in the problem statement), and then reads two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
2. **Reversing Lists**: Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This suggests the algorithm might be trying to work from the end of the queue towards the front.
3. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `soma_b` keeps track of the cumulative cost of bribing people between the current swap point and the previous swap point.
   - `pref` accumulates the total cost of swaps made so far.
   - For the first `n-k` elements, it checks if swapping with the current person (`lista_A[i]`) is cheaper than bribing everyone between the last swap point and the current person (`soma_b`). If it is, it adds `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b`. Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
4. **Final Calculation**:
   - For the last `k` elements, it calculates the total cost of reaching each position and keeps track of the minimum cost.
   - It prints the minimum cost found.

#### Function `func_2`:
- It handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Indexing**: The loop `for i in range(n - k):` suggests that the algorithm is trying to handle the first `n-k` elements, but the logic seems flawed because it doesn't account for the fact that Kirill needs to be in one of the first `m` positions, not necessarily the first `n-k` positions.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost doesn't seem to correctly handle the requirement of reaching one of the first `m` positions. The use of `pref` and `soma_b` doesn't directly translate to the problem's requirements.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program doesn't explicitly handle edge cases like when `m=1` or when all `a_i` and `b_i` values are very large.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the minimum cost and handling the queue positions is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
