In this case, the loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(numero_testes):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable here is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use within the loop body. The loop will iterate `numero_testes` times.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is expected to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. Since `_` is not used in the loop body, its value does not matter for the loop's continuation; it simply acts as a counter that decreases with each iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses. After each iteration, the loop implicitly decrements the counter (which is managed internally by Python's `range` function) until it reaches zero.

Since the loop variable `_` is not modified within the loop body and is not relevant to the state outside the loop, the only state that needs adjustment is the implicit counter managed by `range`. However, since we don't have direct access to this internal counter, we can infer that `numero_testes` should decrease by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases and expected to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, ensuring `numero_testes` is at least 1, and has decreased by 1 from the previous iteration.**

If `numero_testes` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 4 at the start of the next iteration. This pattern continues until `numero_testes` reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates.

So, the final state, considering the decrement, would be:

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases and expected to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, ensuring `numero_testes` is at least 1, and has been decremented by 1.**
