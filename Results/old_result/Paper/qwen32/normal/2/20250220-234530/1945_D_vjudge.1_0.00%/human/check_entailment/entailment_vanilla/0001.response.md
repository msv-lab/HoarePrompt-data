Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. Kirill can swap positions with any person ahead of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap directly with person `j`, and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position.

### Code Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Here's how they work:

- `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
- `func_1()` handles the logic for a single test case.

#### Key Steps in `func_1()`

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads `n` (number of people excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - It reads the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n`.

2. **Reversing Lists:**
   - Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This means that the last element in the original list becomes the first element in the reversed list, and so on.

3. **Calculating Costs:**
   - It initializes `soma_b` (sum of `b` values) and `pref` (prefix cost).
   - For the first `n - m` elements in the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it adds `pref` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - For the remaining `m` elements:
     - It calculates the minimum cost by considering the current `pref` plus `soma_b` plus `lista_A[i]`.
     - It updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the minimum cost found.

### Issues in the Code

The main issue with the code lies in its approach to calculating the minimum cost. Reversing the lists and processing them in reverse order doesn't align with the problem's requirements. The problem requires finding the optimal sequence of swaps to minimize the cost, which involves considering the costs in their original order.

The algorithm should consider the original order of the lists and use a more dynamic programming or greedy approach to find the minimum cost to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
