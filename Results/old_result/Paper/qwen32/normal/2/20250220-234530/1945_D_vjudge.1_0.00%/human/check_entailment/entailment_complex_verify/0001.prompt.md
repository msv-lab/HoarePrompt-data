You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. Kirill can swap positions with any person ahead of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap directly with person `j`, and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position.

### Code Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Here's how they work:

- `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
- `func_1()` handles the logic for a single test case.

#### Key Steps in `func_1()`

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads `n` (number of people excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - It reads the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n`.

2. **Reversing Lists:**
   - Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This means that the last element in the original list becomes the first element in the reversed list, and so on.

3. **Calculating Costs:**
   - It initializes `soma_b` (sum of `b` values) and `pref` (prefix cost).
   - For the first `n - m` elements in the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it adds `pref` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - For the remaining `m` elements:
     - It calculates the minimum cost by considering the current `pref` plus `soma_b` plus `lista_A[i]`.
     - It updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the minimum cost found.

### Issues in the Code

The main issue with the code lies in its approach to calculating the minimum cost. Reversing the lists and processing them in reverse order doesn't align with the problem's requirements. The problem requires finding the optimal sequence of swaps to minimize the cost, which involves considering the costs in their original order.

The algorithm should consider the original order of the lists and use a more dynamic programming or greedy approach to find the minimum cost to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
