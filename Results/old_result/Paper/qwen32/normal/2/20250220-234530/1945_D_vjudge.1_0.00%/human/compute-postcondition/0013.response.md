The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments the variable `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `soma_b` was 0, and after executing the code, `soma_b` will be equal to `lista_B[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `soma_b` is `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is 0, and `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`.**
