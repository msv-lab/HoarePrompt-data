To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

- The loop runs `numero_testes` times.
- After the first iteration, `numero_testes` is confirmed to be at least 1.
- After the second iteration, `numero_testes` remains at least 1.
- After the third iteration, `numero_testes` is confirmed to be between 0 and 10^4 - 1 inclusive.

Since the loop runs `numero_testes` times and each iteration reduces the effective count of remaining iterations by 1, after all iterations are complete, `numero_testes` would have been decremented down to 0.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **numero_testes is 0.**

This means that after executing the loop `numero_testes` times, the value of `numero_testes` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases left to process.
