The code increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Given that `new_median` was previously set to `b[ma]`, and `median` was set to `b[ma] + 1`, after incrementing `b[ma]`, `new_median` will now be equal to the new value of `b[ma]`, and `median` will be equal to `new_median + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer such that `ma` is a valid index in `b`, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
