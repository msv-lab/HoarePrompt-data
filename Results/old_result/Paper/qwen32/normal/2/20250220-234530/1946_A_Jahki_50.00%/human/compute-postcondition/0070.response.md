The code snippet provided is `num2 = int(input())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `num2`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `num2`, which now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is either 0 or the total number of iterations the loop ran, `i` is `i + 1`.**
