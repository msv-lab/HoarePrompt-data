Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `num2` is updated to the integer value of the next input. All other variables retain their initial values.
