The code snippet increments the value of `op` by 1. No other variables are modified by the given code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 2
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`
- `median` must be `b[ma] + 1` or greater
- `new_median` is `b[ma]` after increment
- `b[ma]` is incremented by 1

After executing the code snippet, `op` changes from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
