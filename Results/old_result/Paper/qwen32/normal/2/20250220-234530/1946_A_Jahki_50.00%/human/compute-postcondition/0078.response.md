The code snippet calculates the value of `ma` using the formula `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. This calculation does not affect any other variables except for `ma`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `ma` with its calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string, `b` is the sorted version of `a`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
