To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `a`: A list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`.
   - `num`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `num2`: An input integer that is less than or equal to 10,000.
   - `case`: An input string.
   - `op`: The number of increments needed to make `b[ma]` greater than the original `median`.
   - `b`: The sorted list of integers derived from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented to `median_original + 1`.
   - `ma`: Calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd.
   - `median`: The element at index `ma` in the original sorted list `b`.
   - `new_median`: `median_original + 1`.

2. **Steps to Calculate `op`:**
   - First, the list `a` is derived from the digits in the input string `case`.
   - The list `b` is then created by sorting the list `a`.
   - The median index `ma` is calculated based on the length of `b` (`num2`).
   - The original median `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`.
   - The new median `new_median` is set to `median + 1`.
   - The number of increments `op` required to make `b[ma]` greater than the original `median` is determined. Since `b[ma]` is initially the median, it needs exactly one increment to become `new_median`.

Given this process, the value of `op` will always be 1 because the element at index `ma` (the median) needs exactly one increment to exceed its original value.

Thus, the output of the `print(op)` statement will be:

Output: **1**
