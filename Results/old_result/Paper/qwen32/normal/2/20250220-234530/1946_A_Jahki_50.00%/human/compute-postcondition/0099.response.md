Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- `n`: An integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `a`: A list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string.
- `b`: A sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by `k`.
- `num`: Greater than 0 (but its exact value is not specified).
- `num2`: An input integer.
- `case`: An input string.
- `op`: Equal to `k`.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 (but its exact value is not specified).
- `ma`: 
  - If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.
  - If `num2` is odd, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`.
- `median`: `b[ma] + 1`.
- `new_median`: `b[ma] + k`.

### Key Variables:
- `op` is explicitly stated to be `k`.
- `k` is the smallest integer such that `b[ma] + k > median`.

### Calculation of `k`:
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`.
- To find `k`, we need `b[ma] + k > b[ma] + 1`.
- Therefore, `k` must be at least 1 to satisfy this inequality.
- The smallest integer `k` that satisfies this is `k = 1`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `op` is `k` and `k` is 1, `op` will be 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
