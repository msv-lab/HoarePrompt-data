Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- `i` is `i + 1`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(16668)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `16668`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the integer `16668`.

### Final Output:
Output: **16668**
