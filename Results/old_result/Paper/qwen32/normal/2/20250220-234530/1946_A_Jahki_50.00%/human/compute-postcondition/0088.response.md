To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string
- `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer such that `ma` is a valid index in `b`
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 1
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `new_median <= median` must still hold true. Given the definitions:
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`

Since `new_median` is `b[ma]` and `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, the condition `new_median <= median` is always true because `b[ma] <= b[ma] + 1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `new_median` and `median` for the loop to execute one more time. The states of the other variables do not affect this specific condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer such that `ma` is a valid index in `b`, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
