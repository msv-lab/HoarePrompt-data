To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).
- `n`: An integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive).
- `a`: A list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`.
- `num`: An integer greater than 0.
- `num2`: An input integer.
- `case`: An input string.
- `op`: The total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `b`: A sorted version of the list `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`.
- `ma`: 
  - If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.
  - If `num2` is odd, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`.
- `median`: The value of `b[ma]` before the last increment.
- `new_median`: The value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `op` represents the total number of iterations a loop has run.
- The loop increments `b[ma]` until `new_median > median`.
- The value of `op` is directly related to how many times the loop had to run to achieve this condition.

### Conclusion:
The `print(op)` statement will output the number of iterations the loop ran to ensure that the new median (`new_median`) is greater than the original median (`median`). Since the exact number of iterations depends on the specific values of `a`, `num2`, and the resulting `b` list, we cannot determine a precise numerical value without more specific input data.

However, we know that `op` is the count of these iterations, and it will be a non-negative integer.

### Final Output:
Output: **op (where op is the number of iterations the loop ran to make new_median > median)**
