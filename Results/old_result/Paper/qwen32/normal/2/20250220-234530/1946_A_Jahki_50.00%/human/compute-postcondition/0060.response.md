The given code snippet simply assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `i`, `b`, and `ma` remain unchanged.

Given that `new_median` is set to `b[ma]` and `b[ma]` was previously described as the median value of the list `b` after being incremented, `new_median` now holds this incremented median value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` must be less than `b[ma]` before increment, `new_median` is `b[ma]` after increment**.
