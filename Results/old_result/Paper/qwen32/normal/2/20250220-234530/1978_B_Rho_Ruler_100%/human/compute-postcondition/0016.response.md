The code updates the `max_profit` variable by comparing its current value with `profit_mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`), `high` is set according to the logic (either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`), `low <= high` holds true, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.**
