Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers; `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `max_profit` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`) remain unchanged.
