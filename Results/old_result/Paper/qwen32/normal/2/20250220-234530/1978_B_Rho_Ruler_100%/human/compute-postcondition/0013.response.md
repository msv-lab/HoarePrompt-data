Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`), `high` is set according to the logic (either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`), `low <= high` holds true, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

In natural language: The value of `mid` is now calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`) retain their previous values and conditions (`low <= high` still holds true).
