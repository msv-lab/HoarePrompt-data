You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze both functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Function Analysis

#### `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price. The formula used is:
\[ \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

- \( k \times b \): This part calculates the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices. The price for the i-th bun is \( b - i + 1 \). Summing up these prices for \( i \) from 1 to \( k \) gives us \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \).
- \( (n - k) \times a \): This part calculates the total revenue from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

#### `func_2(n, a, b)`
This function finds the maximum profit by performing a binary search over the possible values of `k` (from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\)).

- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \(\min(n, b)\).
- It iteratively narrows down the range `[low, high]` using binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
- For each midpoint `mid` in the current range, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
- If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means the maximum profit lies in the right half, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
- It keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search.

### Correctness Verification

The approach taken by the program is correct because:
1. The formula in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any given `k`.
2. The binary search in `func_2` efficiently finds the value of `k` that maximizes the profit within the range `[0, \min(n, b)]`.

The binary search ensures that the solution is optimal and runs in \( O(\log(\min(n, b))) \) time per test case, which is efficient given the constraints (\( t \leq 10^4 \), \( n, a, b \leq 10^9 \)).

### Conclusion

The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
