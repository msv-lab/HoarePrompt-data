To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and verify whether it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob aims to maximize his profit by choosing an optimal `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

### Key Points:
1. **Profit Calculation**:
   - For `k` buns sold at a modified price: The price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)`. The total revenue from these `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
   - This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `S = k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - Therefore, the total profit for a given `k` is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Optimization**:
   - We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The program uses binary search to efficiently find this optimal `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula derived above.
- **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**: This function performs a binary search over the possible values of `k` to find the maximum profit.
  - It initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
  - It iteratively narrows down the search range by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) and the next point (`mid + 1`).
  - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means the optimal `k` is likely higher, so it moves `low` to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it moves `high` to `mid - 1`.
  - It keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the search.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit by considering all possible values of `k` through a binary search approach. It efficiently finds the optimal `k` and computes the corresponding profit.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
