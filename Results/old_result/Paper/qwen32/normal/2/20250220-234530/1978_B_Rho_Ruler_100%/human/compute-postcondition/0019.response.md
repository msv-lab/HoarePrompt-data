Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers. `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is set to `mid + 1` and `high` remains as either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`) and `high` is set to `mid - 1`. `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively. `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.**
