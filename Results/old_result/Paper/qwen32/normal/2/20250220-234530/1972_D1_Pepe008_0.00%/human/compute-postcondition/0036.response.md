To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x` given the initial state conditions:

Initial State:
- `t` is \(t + 1\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is \(i + 1\)

The code snippet is:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Let's break down the expression for `x`:
- `i * (i - 1)` is the product of `i` and `i - 1`.
- `i ** 2` is `i` squared.
- `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2` performs integer division of the difference between `a` and `i * (i - 1)` by `i ** 2`.
- Finally, `1` is added to the result of the integer division.

Given these operations, `x` is calculated based on the current values of `a` and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\)**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains \(t + 1\), `T` is still greater than 0, `info` remains the same list of strings, `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` remains an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains \(i + 1\), and `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
