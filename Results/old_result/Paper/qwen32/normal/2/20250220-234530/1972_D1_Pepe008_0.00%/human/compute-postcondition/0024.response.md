The provided code snippet includes nested loops and a conditional print statement, but it does not modify any of the variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, or `suma`. It only prints certain pairs `(i, j)` based on the given condition.

Since none of the variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the printed output which is not represented as a variable in the state.

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the accumulated sum of \(x\) for each iteration where \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\)**

This means that the values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` remain unchanged after the execution of the code snippet.
