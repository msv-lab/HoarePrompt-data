The given code snippet updates the `info` variable by reading a new line of input and splitting it into a list of strings. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, or `suma`. 

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the accumulated sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`**

In simpler terms, the value of `info` changes to reflect the new input line split into a list of strings. All other variables retain their previous values.
