Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Condition Breakdown:
Given the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can rewrite it as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let's denote:
\[ a = d \cdot x \]
\[ b = d \cdot y \]
where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), and \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ d \cdot x + d \cdot y = k \cdot d \cdot y \cdot d \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot d \cdot y \]
\[ x = k \cdot d \cdot y - y \]
\[ x = y \cdot (k \cdot d - 1) \]

This means \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\). Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only way this can happen is if \(y = 1\) and \(x = k \cdot d - 1\). Thus, \(a = d \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\) and \(b = d\).

### Simplified Condition:
The simplified condition becomes:
\[ a = d \cdot (k \cdot d - 1) \]
\[ b = d \]
where \(d\) is a divisor of \(b\), and \(a\) must satisfy \(1 \leq a \leq n\).

### Counting Valid Pairs:
To count the valid pairs, we iterate over possible values of \(d\) (divisors of \(b\)) and check how many valid \(a\) values exist for each \(d\).

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution seems to have a logical error in counting the valid pairs. The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1)` iterates over possible values of \(b\), but the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the counting of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

The commented-out code suggests a brute-force approach, which would be too slow for the given constraints. The provided solution attempts an optimized approach but fails to correctly implement the logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
Correctness: **False**
