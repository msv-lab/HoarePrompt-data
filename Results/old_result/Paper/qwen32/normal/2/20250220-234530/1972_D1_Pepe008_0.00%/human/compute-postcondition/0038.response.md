Postcondition: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\). If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is `suma + x`.**
