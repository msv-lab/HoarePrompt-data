### Reasoning:

The annotated program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to zero for each test case.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
     where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula used inside the loop is derived from the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expression \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) counts the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where \(n\) and \(m\) are small, as seen in the example test cases.
   - It also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently due to the optimized formula.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used is derived from the mathematical condition provided in the problem statement, and the program efficiently computes the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
