The code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is \(t + 1\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1
- `suma` is 0
- `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\), and \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\)

After executing the code, the value of `suma` becomes `x` since `suma` was initially 0.

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\), `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)**
