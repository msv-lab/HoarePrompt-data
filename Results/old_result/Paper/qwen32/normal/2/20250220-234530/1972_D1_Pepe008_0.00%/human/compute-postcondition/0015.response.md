The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `b` must be greater than or equal to this new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is greater than 0
- `suma` is the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`
- `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged
- `i` is incremented by 1

We need to adjust `i` and ensure `b` is greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than `i`, `suma` is the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1** 

To be more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1` and `b` should be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than `i`, `suma` is the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**
