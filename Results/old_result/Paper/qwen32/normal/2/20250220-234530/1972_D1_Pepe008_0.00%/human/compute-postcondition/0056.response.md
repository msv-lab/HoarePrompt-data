To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x` given the initial conditions.

Initial State: 
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `i + 2`

Given Code:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Here, `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we'll keep it as `a` in our calculations.

Let's break down the expression for `x`:

1. `i * (i - 1)` computes the product of `i` and `i - 1`.
2. `i ** 2` computes the square of `i`.
3. `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2` performs integer division of the difference between `a` and the product from step 1 by the square from step 2.
4. Finally, `+ 1` adds 1 to the result from step 3.

Since `a` is not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value for `x`. However, we can express `x` in terms of `a` and `i`.

The value of `i` is `i + 2`, so let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 2`.

Thus, the expression for `x` becomes:
\[ x = \left( a - i_{\text{new}} \cdot (i_{\text{new}} - 1) \right) // i_{\text{new}}^2 + 1 \]

Substituting \( i_{\text{new}} = i + 2 \):
\[ x = \left( a - (i + 2) \cdot ((i + 2) - 1) \right) // (i + 2)^2 + 1 \]
\[ x = \left( a - (i + 2) \cdot (i + 1) \right) // (i + 2)^2 + 1 \]
\[ x = \left( a - (i^2 + 3i + 2) \right) // (i + 2)^2 + 1 \]
\[ x = \left( a - i^2 - 3i - 2 \right) // (i + 2)^2 + 1 \]

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is `(a - i**2 - 3*i - 2) // (i + 2)**2 + 1`**
