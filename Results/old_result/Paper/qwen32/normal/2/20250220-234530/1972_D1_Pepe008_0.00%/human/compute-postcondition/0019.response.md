To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop evolves and accumulates its results. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`. For each iteration, it calculates `x` and adds it to `suma` if the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds.

Let's break down the final state:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `T`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `info`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `a`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `b`: Remains unchanged as it is the loop's upper limit.
- `suma`: Accumulates the sum of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

### Final Output State Calculation:

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b`. For each `i`, it computes:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
and adds `x` to `suma` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

The final value of `suma` will be the sum of all valid `x` values computed during these iterations.

### Output State:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`; `suma` is the accumulated sum of \(x\) for each iteration where \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\).**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `suma` will hold the total sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop, while all other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
