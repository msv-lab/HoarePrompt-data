The given code updates the value of `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `x`.

Let's break down the new value of `x`:

- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed.
- The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` calculates the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is determined by the above formula.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is greater than 0; `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\); `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), otherwise `x` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `x` is now \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\)**.
