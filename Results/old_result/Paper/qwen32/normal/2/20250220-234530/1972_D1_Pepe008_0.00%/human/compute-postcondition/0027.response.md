To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x` using the given initial state. The expression for `x` is:

\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

Given:
- `t` is \(t + 1\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1
- `suma` is 0

However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. For the sake of this example, let's assume `i` is a known integer value. Since `i` is not specified, we will leave it as `i` in our final expression.

The value of `x` will be calculated as:

\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

This means `x` depends on the values of `a` and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)**

In natural language: The value of `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\). All other variables remain unchanged except for the addition of `x`.
