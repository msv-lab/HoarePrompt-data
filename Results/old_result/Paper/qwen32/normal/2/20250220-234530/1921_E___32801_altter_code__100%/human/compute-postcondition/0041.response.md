The code snippet `y1 += a` increments `y1` by the value of `a`. Given that `a` is `0`, `y1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]; `n` is the first element of `r`; `m` is the second element of `r`; `x1` is the third element of `r` plus 1; `y1` is the fourth element of `r` minus 1; `x2` is the fifth element of `r`; `y2` is equal to `m`; `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `a` is `0`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `t` is the absolute difference between `m` and `y1`.**
