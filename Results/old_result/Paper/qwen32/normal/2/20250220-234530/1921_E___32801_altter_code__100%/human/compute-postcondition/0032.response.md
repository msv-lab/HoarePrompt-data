Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
- `n` is the first element of `r` (which is `h`).
- `m` is the second element of `r` (which is `w`).
- `x1` is calculated as:
  \[
  x_a + 1 + (\text{if } y_a \geq y_b \text{ then } y_b - 1 \text{ else } m - y_b)
  \]
- `y1` is calculated as:
  \[
  y_a + 1 \text{ if } y_b > y_a, \text{ otherwise } y_a - 1
  \]
- `x2` is calculated as:
  \[
  x_b - (\text{if } y_a \geq y_b \text{ then } y_b - 1 \text{ else } m - y_b)
  \]
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r` (which is `y_b`).
- `a` is calculated as:
  \[
  y_b - 1 \text{ if } y_a \geq y_b, \text{ otherwise } m - y_b
  \]
- `b` is calculated as:
  \[
  x_b - x_1
  \]
- `t` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`:
  \[
  |y_b - y_1|
  \]
- Additional conditions are provided but do not affect the `print` statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('draw')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `a`, `b`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
