Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the information provided:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] for one of the test cases.
- For each of the next t-1 lines, there are six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b with specific constraints.
- `n` is the first element of `r` (which is `h`).
- `m` is the second element of `r` (which is `w`).
- `x1` is the third element of `r` (which is `x_a`).
- `y1` is the fourth element of `r` (which is `y_a`).
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r` (which is `x_b`).
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r` (which is `y_b`).
- It is guaranteed that `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to the current value of `y2`.

The Python code snippet simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Since the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any calculations or conditions involving the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`, the output will always be the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
