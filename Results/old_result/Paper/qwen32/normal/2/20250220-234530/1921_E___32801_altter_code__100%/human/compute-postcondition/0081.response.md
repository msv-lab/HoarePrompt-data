Let's break down the initial state and the given conditions to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List `r`:** 
   - `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.

2. **Variables Derived from `r`:**
   - `n` is the first element of `r` (`h`).
   - `m` is the second element of `r` (`w`).
   - `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a` (`x_a + a`). Since `a` is 0, `x1` is simply `x_a`.
   - `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a` (`x_b - a`). Since `a` is 0, `x2` is simply `x_b`.

3. **Conditional Variables:**
   - `y1` is set to 1 if `y_a <= y_b`; otherwise, it is set to `m`.
   - `y2` remains `y_b` if `y_a <= y_b`; otherwise, it becomes `m`.
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - 1)` if `y_a <= y_b`; otherwise, `t` is 0.
   - `c` is `t` if `y_a <= y_b`; otherwise, `c` is 0.

4. **Additional Conditions:**
   - `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2` if `y_a <= y_b`; otherwise, `y1` is equal to `y2`.
   - `x1` is at least 1.
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `not (1 <= y1 <= m)` or `not (1 <= x1 <= n)` holds true.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('draw')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values; it directly prints the string `'draw'`.

### Conclusion:

The print statement will output the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Output: **draw**
