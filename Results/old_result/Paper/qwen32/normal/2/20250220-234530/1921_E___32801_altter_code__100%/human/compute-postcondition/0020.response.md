Given the provided initial state and the Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

The code snippet provided is just `return`, which means the function will return `None` by default since no specific value or variable is specified to be returned.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant variables based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `r` is a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
- `n` is the first element of `r` (i.e., `h`).
- `m` is the second element of `r` (i.e., `w`).
- `x1` is the third element of `r` plus 1 (i.e., `x_a + 1`).
- `y1` is calculated based on the condition involving `y_a` and `y_b`. Since `y1` is explicitly stated to be equal to `y2` in the initial state, `y1` is the same as the sixth element of `r` (i.e., `y_b`).
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r` (i.e., `x_b`).
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r` (i.e., `y_b`).

Since the code simply returns without specifying any variable or value, the output will be `None`.

Output State: **The program returns None**.
