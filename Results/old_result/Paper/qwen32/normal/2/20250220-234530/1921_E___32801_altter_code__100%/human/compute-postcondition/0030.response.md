The code snippet `x2 -= a` modifies the value of `x2` by subtracting the value of `a` from it. Let's determine the new value of `x2` and ensure that all other conditions and variable relationships remain consistent.

Given:
- `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` ≥ `y2`, otherwise `a` is `m - y2`.

After executing `x2 -= a`, the new value of `x2` will be `x2 - a`.

Let's express the updated state:

- If `y1` ≥ `y2`, then `a = y2 - 1`, so `x2` becomes `x2 - (y2 - 1)`.
- If `y1` < `y2`, then `a = m - y2`, so `x2` becomes `x2 - (m - y2)`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]; `n` is the first element of `r`; `m` is the second element of `r`; `x1` is the third element of `r` plus 1 plus (`y2 - 1` if `y1` ≥ `y2` else `m - y2`); `y1` is the fourth element of `r` plus 1 if `y2` > `y1`, otherwise `y1` is the fourth element of `r` minus 1; `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus (`y2 - 1` if `y1` ≥ `y2` else `m - y2`); `y2` is the sixth element of `r`; `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` ≥ `y2`, otherwise `a` is `m - y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**
