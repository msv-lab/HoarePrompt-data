Output State: **The program does not return any value.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet ends with a `return` statement without any expression or variable specified. In Python, this means the function will return `None` by default, but since no return value is explicitly mentioned in the task, we can infer that the program simply terminates without returning any value.
