The code sets `y1` to 1. This change affects the value of `t` because `t` is defined as `abs(y2 - y1)`. Since `y1` is now 1, `t` will be recalculated as `abs(y2 - 1)`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `r` is still a list of six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
- `n` is still the first element of `r`.
- `m` is still the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is still the third element of `r` plus `a`.
- `y1` is now 1.
- `x2` is still the fifth element of `r` minus `a`.
- `y2` remains the same.
- `x2` is still greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2` (since `y2` was originally greater than or equal to `y1` and `y1` is now 1).
- `a` is `y1 - 1`, which is now `1 - 1 = 0`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `x2` is still greater than `x1`.
- `x1` is still at least 1.
- `x2` is still less than or equal to `n`.
- `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.
