Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] for one of the test cases; Each of the next t-1 lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `n` is the first element of `r`; `m` is the second element of `r`; `x1` is the third element of `r`; `y1` is the fourth element of `r`; `x2` is the fifth element of `r`; `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.**

In simple terms, the variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` have been assigned the values from the list `r`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
