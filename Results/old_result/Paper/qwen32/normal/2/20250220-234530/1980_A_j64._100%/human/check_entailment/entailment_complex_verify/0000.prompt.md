You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds.
- Each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- Vlad has `n` problems in his bank with varying difficulty levels.
- We need to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to meet the requirement of having one problem of each difficulty level for each round.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of problems (`n`) and the number of rounds (`m`).
2. Reads the string `a` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.
3. Calls the function `func_1(n, m, a)` to compute the minimum number of additional problems needed.

The function `func_1`:
1. Initializes a list `count` of size 7 to zero, representing the counts of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
2. Iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each problem.
3. Computes the number of additional problems needed by checking if the count of problems for each difficulty level is less than `m`. If so, it adds the difference to `needed_problems`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the correctness of the program by considering the provided examples and some edge cases:

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The counts are B:2, G:2, E:2, C:2, D:2. We need 1 of A and 1 of F, so 2 additional problems.
   
2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The counts are B:2, G:2, E:2, C:2, D:2. We need 2 of A, 2 of F, and 1 of G, so 5 additional problems.
   
3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The counts are B:2, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:2, G:2. We need 1 of A, so 1 additional problem.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **All Problems of Same Difficulty Level:**
   - Input: `7 1 AAAAAAA`
   - Output: `6`
   - Explanation: We need 1 of each difficulty level except A, so 6 additional problems.
   
2. **No Existing Problems:**
   - Input: `0 1`
   - Output: `7`
   - Explanation: We need 1 of each difficulty level, so 7 additional problems.
   
3. **Maximum Rounds:**
   - Input: `7 5 ABCDEFG`
   - Output: `28`
   - Explanation: We need 5 of each difficulty level, and we only have 1 of each, so 4 additional problems per level, totaling 28.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the provided examples and edge cases correctly. It accurately calculates the number of additional problems required by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level and comparing them against the required number of problems per round.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly computes the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level and ensuring that there are enough problems for each round. It handles various scenarios including edge cases where all problems are of the same difficulty level, no existing problems, and the maximum number of rounds.
