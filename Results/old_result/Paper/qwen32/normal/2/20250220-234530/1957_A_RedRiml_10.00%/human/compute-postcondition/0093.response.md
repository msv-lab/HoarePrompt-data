The code appends the variable `i` to the list `pl`. This means `pl` is no longer an empty list but now contains the element `i`. The other variables (`palka`, `w`, `d`, `shapes`, `ln`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list containing the element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or incremented by `1` (if `i` was already in `d`), `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer, `i` is not in `pl` (this condition is no longer valid as `i` has been added to `pl`).**
