The code snippet `ln = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ln`. This does not affect the initial state of `t`, `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, or `w`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `ln` which holds the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input.**
