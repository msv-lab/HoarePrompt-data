Postcondition: **`palka` is the original list of integers that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. If the current element `j` in `d` has a count of at least 3, `shapes` is 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0. `ln` is the original input integer, `j` is the next element in `pl` after the current `j`. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, `shapes` is set to 1; otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
