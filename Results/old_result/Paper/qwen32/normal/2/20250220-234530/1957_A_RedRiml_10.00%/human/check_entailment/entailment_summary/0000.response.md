### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks such that each polygon has sides of equal length and no stick is reused.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Each polygon must have at least 3 sides (since a polygon with fewer than 3 sides is not possible).
   - Each stick can be used in exactly one polygon.
3. **Approach**:
   - For each test case, count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - For each unique stick length, check if there are at least 3 sticks of that length.
   - The number of such unique stick lengths gives the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Number of Polygons**:
   - It initializes a counter `shapes` to zero.
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, it checks if the count `d[j]` is at least 3.
   - If true, it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `shapes`.

#### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least 3 times, which corresponds to the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
- The logic aligns with the problem statement, as each unique stick length that appears at least 3 times can form one polygon.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
