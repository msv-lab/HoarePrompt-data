You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and prints the number of unique integers in each list that appear at least three times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. The current implementation counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of polygons.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

Explanation:
With six sticks of length 2, we can form two equilateral triangles (polygons with 3 sides). However, the program will only count this as one polygon because it only checks if there are at least three sticks of the same length, without considering how many such polygons can be formed.

Another example:

**Input:**
```
1
9
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

Here, we can form three equilateral triangles with the nine sticks of length 3, but the program will only count this as one polygon.

To fix the program, we need to divide the count of each stick length by the number of sides required for the smallest possible polygon (which is 3) and sum these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.

A corrected version of the program would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 and summing the results.
