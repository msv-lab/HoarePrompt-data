Postcondition: **`w` is the length of `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. If there exists an element `j` in `d` such that the count of `j` in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
