Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements; `pl` is a list that now contains the integer `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`); `i` is the element in `palka` after `i_next`.**
