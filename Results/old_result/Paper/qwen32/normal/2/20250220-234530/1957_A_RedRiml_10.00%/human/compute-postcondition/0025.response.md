The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the end of the list `pl`. This means that `pl` will now contain all its previous elements plus the new element `i`.

Given the initial state, `pl` is a list that may or may not already contain certain integers, and `i` is an integer that is being appended to `pl`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `i_next`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is that `pl` now includes the integer `i` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements; `pl` is a list that now contains the integer `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` and now also contains the integer `i` again; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either 1 (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`); `i` is the element in `palka` after `i_next`.**
