In the given task, the for loop iterates over `pl`, which is a list of unique elements from `palka`. To ensure that the loop executes, `pl` must contain at least one element.

Let's analyze the state before the loop:

- `w` is the length of `palka`.
- `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`.
- `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`.
- `shapes` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it iterates over `pl`. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `pl` to ensure that the loop can execute.

To make sure the loop executes, `pl` must have at least one element.

State: **`w` is the length of `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`, and `shapes` is 0**.
