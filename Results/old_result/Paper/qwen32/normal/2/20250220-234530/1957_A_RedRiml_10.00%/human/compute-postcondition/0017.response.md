Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements; `pl` is a list. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, then `pl` now contains the integer `i`. `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`; `d[i]` has been incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
