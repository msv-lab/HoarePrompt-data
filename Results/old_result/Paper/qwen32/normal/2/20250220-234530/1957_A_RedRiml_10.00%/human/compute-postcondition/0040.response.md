To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet provided:

### Initial State:
- `shapes` is defined as the total number of unique elements in the list `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in the dictionary `d`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(shapes)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `shapes`:** This variable holds the count of unique elements from the list `pl` that appear 3 or more times in the dictionary `d`.
2. **Dictionary `d`:** It contains elements from the list `pl` as keys and their respective counts as values.
3. **List `pl`:** It contains elements whose counts are stored in the dictionary `d`.

Given the initial state, we know that `shapes` is calculated based on the counts of elements in `d`. However, the specific contents of `pl` and `d` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(shapes)` statement will output the value of `shapes`, which is the number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`)**
