The function `func_1` takes a list of characters `path` where each character is either '@' or '*'. It returns 0 if the list is empty. Otherwise, it calculates a score based on the sequence of characters, where '@' contributes positively to the score and '*' results in a score of negative infinity for that position. The function returns the highest possible score from the sequence, ignoring any positions with a score of negative infinity.
