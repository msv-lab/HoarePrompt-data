Output State: **`path` is `'a_5'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`; `index` is 5; `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5')]`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**

Explanation: The `results` list has been updated to include the result of `func_1(path)`, which means `results` now contains two elements: the result of `func_1('a_3')` and the result of `func_1('a_5')`. All other variables remain unchanged.
