Output State: **`path` is `'a_5'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t + 1`; `index` is 6; `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5')]`; `n` is `6`.**

In natural language: The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it 6. All other variables retain their original values.
