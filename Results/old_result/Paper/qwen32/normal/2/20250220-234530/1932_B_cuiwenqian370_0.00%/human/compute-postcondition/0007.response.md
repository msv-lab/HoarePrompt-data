The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Given the initial state, `index` was 1, so after the increment, `index` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 2; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
