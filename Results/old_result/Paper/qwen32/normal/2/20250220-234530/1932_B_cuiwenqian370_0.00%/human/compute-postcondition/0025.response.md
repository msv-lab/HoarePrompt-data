Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `path` is a string `'a_{1+2*t}'`.
- `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.
- `data` is a list of strings `['1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`.
- `t` is an integer `1`.
- `index` is an integer `3`.
- `results` is a list containing one element `[func_1('a_3')]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `result`**: The variable `result` is not defined in the initial state. It seems there might be a typo in the print statement. The intended variable might be `results` (plural), which is a list containing one element `[func_1('a_3')]`.

2. **List `results`**: The list `results` contains one element, which is the result of the function call `func_1('a_3')`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `results[0]`.

Given the above analysis, it appears there is a typo in the print statement. If we assume the correct variable name is `results`, then the print statement should be:
```python
print(results)
```

### Output:
Since `results` is a list containing one element `[func_1('a_3')]`, and `func_1` is not defined, we can only describe the output in terms of the function call.

Output: **[func_1('a_3')] (where func_1 is a function that takes 'a_3' as an argument)**
