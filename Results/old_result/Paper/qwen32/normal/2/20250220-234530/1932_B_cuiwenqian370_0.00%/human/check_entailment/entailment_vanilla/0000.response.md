Reasoning: 

The given problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign will occur, considering that each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one. The program provided does not address this problem at all. Instead, it seems to be solving a different problem related to counting '@' symbols in a string while avoiding '*' symbols, which is unrelated to the described problem.

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **func_1(path)**: This function appears to process a string `path` and counts occurrences of '@' symbols while avoiding '*' symbols. It uses dynamic programming to achieve this. However, this logic is entirely unrelated to the problem of determining the year in which the nth sign will occur based on their periodicities.

2. **func_2()**: This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case. It then prints the results. Since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, `func_2` also does not solve the intended problem.

Given the mismatch between the problem description and the provided code, it is clear that the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
