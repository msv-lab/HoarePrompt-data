Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `path` is a string `'a_{1+2*t}'`.
- `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.
- `data` is a list of strings `['1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`.
- `t` is an integer `1`.
- `index` is an integer `3`.
- `results` is a list `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4')]`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(result)
```

However, there is a typo in the print statement. It should be `results` instead of `result`. Assuming the intention was to print `results`, let's proceed with that.

### Determining the Value of `results`:
- `results` is defined as `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4')]`.
- The function `func_1` is not defined in the given initial state, so we cannot determine the exact return values of `func_1('a_3')` and `func_1('a_4')`.

Given this, we can only describe the output in terms of the function calls.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(results)` statement will print the list containing the results of the function `func_1` applied to the strings `'a_3'` and `'a_4'`.

Output: **[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4')] (where func_1 is a function that processes the input strings 'a_3' and 'a_4')**
