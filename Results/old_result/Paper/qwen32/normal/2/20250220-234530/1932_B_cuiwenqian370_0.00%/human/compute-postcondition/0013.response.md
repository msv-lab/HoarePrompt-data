The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `index` was 3, so the new value of `index` is 4. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`; `index` is 4; `results` is `[func_1('a_3')]`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
