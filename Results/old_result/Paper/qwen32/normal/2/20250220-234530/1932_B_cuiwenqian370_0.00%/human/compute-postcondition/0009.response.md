The value of `index` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `index` is 2, after the increment, `index` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
