The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `path`. Given that `index` is 2, `path` will be assigned the value of `data[2]`, which is `'a_3'` (since `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']).

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `path` is now `'a_3'`.
- `input` remains the `sys.stdin.read` function.
- `data` remains ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n'].
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `index` remains 2.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `n` remains the integer value of `a_2`.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 2; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
