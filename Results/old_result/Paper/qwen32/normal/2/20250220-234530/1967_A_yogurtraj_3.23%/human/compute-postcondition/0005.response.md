The given code snippet initializes a variable `rem` to 0. No other variables are modified in the snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the first element of `a`; `rem` is 0.**
