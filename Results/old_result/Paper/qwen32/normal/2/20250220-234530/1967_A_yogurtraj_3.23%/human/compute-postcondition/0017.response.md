Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is set to 0, `y` is set to 0, and either `i + 1` is out of bounds for `a` or `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**
