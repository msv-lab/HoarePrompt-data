The code snippet updates the value of `r` based on the current value of `a[i]` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.
- `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `a[i + 1]`.
- `rem` is `0`.
- `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`.
- `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The code snippet:
```python
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

Updates `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**
