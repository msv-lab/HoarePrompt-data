Postcondition: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the smallest integer in the list `a`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; and it is not the case that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)**
