The code snippet assigns the value of `k % (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. This operation calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `(i + 1)`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, `i` remains `i + 1`, and `r` remains `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `rem`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is `i + 1`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.
