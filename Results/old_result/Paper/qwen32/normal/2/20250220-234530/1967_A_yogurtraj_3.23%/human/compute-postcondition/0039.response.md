Output State: **`r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or `0`, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `0`, and `k` is either `0` or reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-2`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to `0`.**

In natural language: The value of `r` is now updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. The values of `rem`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
