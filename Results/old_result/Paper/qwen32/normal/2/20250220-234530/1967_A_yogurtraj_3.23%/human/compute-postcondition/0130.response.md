To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of elements in the list `a`.
     - `k`: A non-negative integer.
     - `a`: A list of `n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The list `a` is sorted.
   - Variables `r`, `rem`, and `y` are initialized.
   - The inner loop iterates over the sorted list `a` to determine how `k` can be distributed among the elements.
   - If at any point `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, the loop breaks, and `r`, `rem`, and `y` are set accordingly.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `r` is set to `a[n - 1]`.
   - Finally, the result is printed based on the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

### Final Output State

After all test cases have been processed, the variables `n`, `a`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. However, since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, we focus on the final printed result rather than the intermediate variables.

### Calculation of the Final Output

For each test case, the final output is calculated as follows:
- If `k` is not zero after processing the list, the output is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
- If `k` is zero, the output is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

Since the problem specifies the output for the first three iterations, we can infer that the final output state will be the result of the last test case processed.

### Final Output State

Given the loop processes `t` test cases, the final output state will be the result of the `t`-th test case. Therefore, the output state after all iterations is the result of the last test case processed.

**Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

In natural language, the final output state is the result of the last test case processed, which is printed based on the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` after the inner loop completes or breaks for the last test case.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **the result of the last test case processed.**
