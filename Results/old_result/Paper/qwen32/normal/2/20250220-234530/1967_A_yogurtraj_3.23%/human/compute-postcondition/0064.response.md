The code snippet updates the value of `rem` to be the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `rem` is updated as follows:

- `rem` is now `k % (i + 1)`

All other variables (`a`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `y`, `ii`, `i`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**
