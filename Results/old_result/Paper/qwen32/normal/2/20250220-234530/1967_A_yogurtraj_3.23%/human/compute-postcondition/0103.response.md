Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; and it is not the case that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)**

Natural Language: The value of `r` has been updated to `a[i + 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
