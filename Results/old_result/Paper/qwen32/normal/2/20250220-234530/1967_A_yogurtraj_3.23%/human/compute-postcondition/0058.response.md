Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `r` is the first element of `a`; `rem` is `0`; `y` is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`**
