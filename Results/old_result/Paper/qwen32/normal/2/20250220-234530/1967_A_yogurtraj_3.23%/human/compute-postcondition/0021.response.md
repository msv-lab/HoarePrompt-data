The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `r`, and `rem` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**
