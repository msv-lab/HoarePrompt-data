The code snippet provided is:

```python
y = n - 1 - i
```

This line of code assigns a new value to the variable `y`. According to the initial state, `y` is already defined in two different ways depending on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. However, the given code snippet reassigns `y` to `n - 1 - i` regardless of the previous condition.

Therefore, the new value of `y` will be `n - 1 - i`.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`) or reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (otherwise); `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
