Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is either 0 (if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` was greater than `k` and we broke out of the loop) or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` (if the else part was executed); `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it remains `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**
