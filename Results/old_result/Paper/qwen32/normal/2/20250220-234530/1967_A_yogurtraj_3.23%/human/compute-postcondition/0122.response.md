Postcondition: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is assigned the value `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is assigned the value `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is assigned the value `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is assigned the value `a[i + 1]`.**
