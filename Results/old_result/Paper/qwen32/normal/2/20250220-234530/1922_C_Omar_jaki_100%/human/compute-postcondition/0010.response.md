To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the `zip` function applied to slices of the list `a`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were assigned values from the current slice of `a`.
- The loop iterates over tuples formed by elements `(a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2], a[i+3])`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `w` should take the value of the next element in `a` after the current `x`.
- `x` should take the value of the next element in `a` after the current `y`.
- `y` should take the value of the next element in `a` after the current `z`.
- `z` should take the value of the element following `z` in `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the indices as follows:
- Let `i` be the starting index of the current tuple `(w, x, y, z)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the indices would be such that:
- `w = a[i]`
- `x = a[i+1]`
- `y = a[i+2]`
- `z = a[i+3]`

For the next iteration, the indices should be incremented by 1:
- `w = a[i+1]`
- `x = a[i+2]`
- `y = a[i+3]`
- `z = a[i+4]`

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can express the new state in terms of the current state:
- `w` will be the next element after the current `x`, which means `w` becomes `a[i+1]`.
- `x` will be the next element after the current `y`, which means `x` becomes `a[i+2]`.
- `y` will be the next element after the current `z`, which means `y` becomes `a[i+3]`.
- `z` will be the element after the current `z`, which means `z` becomes `a[i+4]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers, `b` is [0, 0, v], `w` is `a[i+1]`, `x` is `a[i+2]`, `y` is `a[i+3]`, `z` is `a[i+4]`**
