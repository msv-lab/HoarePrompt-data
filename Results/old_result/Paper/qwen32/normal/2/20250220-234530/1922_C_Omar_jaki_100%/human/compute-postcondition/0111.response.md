To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the problem step-by-step using the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `r1` is `2000000000.0`
- `r2` is `2000000000.0`
- `t` is `False`
- `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
- `u` is `False`
- `c` and `d` are the return values of `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

#### Step 1: Understanding `c` and `d`
- `c` and `d` are the return values of the function `r()`.
- We know that either `c < d` or `c >= d`.

#### Step 2: Calculating Indices
- The expression `b[c * 2 - 1]` calculates the element at index `c * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.
- Similarly, `b[d * 2 - 1]` calculates the element at index `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

#### Step 3: Values of `b`
- The list `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.

#### Step 4: Possible Values of `c` and `d`
- Since `c` and `d` are indices used to access elements in `b`, they must be valid indices for `b`.
- The valid indices for `b` are from 0 to 7 (inclusive).

#### Step 5: Determining the Output
- Let's consider the two cases for `c` and `d`:
  1. If `c < d`:
     - `b[c * 2 - 1]` will be some element in `b`.
     - `b[d * 2 - 1]` will be another element in `b`.
     - The difference `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will be calculated.
  2. If `c >= d`:
     - Similar to the above case, but the order of subtraction will be reversed.

However, without knowing the exact values of `c` and `d` returned by `r()`, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. But we can describe the output in terms of `c` and `d`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement depends on the values of `c` and `d` which are the return values of `r()`. Given the structure of the problem, the output will be the difference between the elements at indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are the return values of r(), and b is the list [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3])**
