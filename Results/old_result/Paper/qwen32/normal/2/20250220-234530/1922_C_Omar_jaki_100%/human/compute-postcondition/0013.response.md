To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables defined in the loop head: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the variables were:
- `w` is `a[i+1]`
- `x` is `a[i+2]`
- `y` is `a[i+3]`
- `z` is `a[i+4]`
- `v` is `y - x`

For the next iteration, the indices should be incremented by 1:
- `w` should be `a[i+2]`
- `x` should be `a[i+3]`
- `y` should be `a[i+4]`
- `z` should be `a[i+5]`

Additionally, `v` should be recalculated as `y - x` for the new values of `y` and `x`.

Let's update the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers where -1000000000.0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n < 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers, `b` is [0, 0, v, v, 2 * v], `w` is `a[i+2]`, `x` is `a[i+3]`, `y` is `a[i+4]`, `z` is `a[i+5]`, `v` is `y - x`**
