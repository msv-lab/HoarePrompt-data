Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the m queries, there are two integers x and y such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n and x ≠ y. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined.**
