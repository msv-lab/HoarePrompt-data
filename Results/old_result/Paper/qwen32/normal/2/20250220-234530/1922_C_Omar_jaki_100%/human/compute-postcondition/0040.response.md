The code snippet `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Given that `t` must be truthy initially, it means `t` could be any non-zero value (positive or negative). After decrementing, `t` will still be truthy unless it was 1 initially, in which case it would become 0 (falsy).

Since the list and the variable `u` are not affected by the operation, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **[0, 0, v1, v1, 2*v1, v1+v2, v1+v2, 2*v1+v2, ..., sum(v1, ..., vk), sum(v1, ..., vk), 2*sum(v1, ..., vk)], u = 0, t is truthy unless it was 1 initially, in which case t = 0.**
