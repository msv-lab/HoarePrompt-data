To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function, so we don't need to set its value explicitly before the loop starts. However, we do need to ensure that `n` is set appropriately.

The other variables mentioned (`t`, `x`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the given instructions.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` must be greater than 0**
