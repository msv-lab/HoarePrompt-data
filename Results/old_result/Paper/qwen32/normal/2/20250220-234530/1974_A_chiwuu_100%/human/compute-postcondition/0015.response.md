The given code snippet calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. Given the initial state, `t1` is already calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

Therefore, `t2` will be `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and `t1` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `t2`. 

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer, and it is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t1` is less than `a`; `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.**
