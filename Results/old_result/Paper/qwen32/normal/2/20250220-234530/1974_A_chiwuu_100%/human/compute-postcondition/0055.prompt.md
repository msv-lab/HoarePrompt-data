Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer, `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, if `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`) is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, plus `t2 // 15` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the second integer from the input divided by 2 if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is `t // 2 + 1`; `a` is the first integer from the input; `b` is the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `i` is `i + 1`. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, the program does not change `t`. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on whether `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`) is divisible by 15. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `(a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `a // 15 + b * 4 // 15 + 1`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2`) retain their respective values as described in the precondition, with `t1` recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2` recalculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` if `t` is updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `i` is `i + 2`. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on whether `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`) is divisible by 15. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `(a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is set to `a // 15 + b * 4 // 15 + 1`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2`) retain their respective values as described in the precondition, with `t1` recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2` recalculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` if `t` is updated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
