Postcondition: **`t` is an integer, and it is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Additionally, `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**
