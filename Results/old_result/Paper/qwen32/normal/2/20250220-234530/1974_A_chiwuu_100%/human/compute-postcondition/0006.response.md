Postcondition: **`t` is equal to `b`, and `t` is even; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99.**
