Postcondition: **`t` is an integer. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, plus `t2 // 15` plus 1. `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t1` is less than `a`; `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.**
