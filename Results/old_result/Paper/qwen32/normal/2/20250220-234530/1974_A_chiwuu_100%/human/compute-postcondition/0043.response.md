The code snippet assigns the value of `b` to `t`. This means that the new value of `t` is now the same as the value of `b`.

Given the initial state, `t` was previously calculated as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd. However, after executing the code snippet, `t` is simply `b`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `t` is `b`, `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `i` is `i + 2`. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, the program does not change `t`. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on whether `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`) is divisible by 15. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `(a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `a // 15 + b * 4 // 15 + 1`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2`) retain their respective values as described in the precondition, with `t1` recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2` recalculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` if `t` is updated.**
