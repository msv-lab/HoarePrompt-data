The value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`. Given that `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, the new value of `t2` will be `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `t1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the second integer from the input divided by 2 if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is `t // 2 + 1`; `a` is the first integer from the input; `b` is the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `i` is `i + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**.
