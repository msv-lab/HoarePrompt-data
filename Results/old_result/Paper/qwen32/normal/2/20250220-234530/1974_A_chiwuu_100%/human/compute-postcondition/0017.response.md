Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer, and it is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd.
- `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- For each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t1` is less than `a`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- Additionally, `t2` is divisible by 15.

Code Snippet:
```python
t = t + t2 // 15
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its current value.

Output State:
- `t` is now `t + (a - t1) // 15`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t + (a - t1) // 15`; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t1` is less than `a`; `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`; `t2` is divisible by 15.**
