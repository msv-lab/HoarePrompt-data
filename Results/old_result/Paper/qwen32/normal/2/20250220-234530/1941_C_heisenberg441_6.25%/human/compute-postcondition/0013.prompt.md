Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Additionally, the string s is not equal to 'mapie'; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while s.find('map') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
    ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), each test case consists of an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with the first occurrence of `'map'` modified to `'m'`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\), `ans` is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `s` is a string of length `n` with the first occurrence of 'map' modified to 'm', `ans` is 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) (but now `n` is reduced by 2), `s` is a string of length `n-2` that no longer contains 'ap' from the first 'map', `ans` is 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
