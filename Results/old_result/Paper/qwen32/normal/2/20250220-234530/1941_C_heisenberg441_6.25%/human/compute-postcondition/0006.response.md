Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), each test case consists of an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with the first occurrence of `'map'` modified to `'m'`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\), `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
