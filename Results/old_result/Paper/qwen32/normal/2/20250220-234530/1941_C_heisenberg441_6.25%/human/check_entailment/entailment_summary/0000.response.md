### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem requirements:

1. **Handling Specific Case**: The function `func_1` first checks if the string `s` is exactly 'mapie'. If it is, it returns 1. However, according to the problem, the string 'mapie' should be considered ugly because it contains both "map" and "pie". Therefore, the correct number of deletions required to make 'mapie' beautiful is actually 2 (removing either "map" or "pie" would leave the other substring intact). Hence, returning 1 here is incorrect.

2. **Removing Substrings**: The function then proceeds to remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the string `s` by finding their indices and slicing the string around them. It increments the `ans` counter each time a substring is removed.

3. **Counting Deletions**: The function counts the total number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' and returns this count.

### Issues Identified:
- The specific case handling for 'mapie' is incorrect.
- The function correctly identifies and removes 'map' and 'pie' substrings but does not account for overlapping substrings properly. For example, if a string contains "mappie", the function might incorrectly count only one deletion when two are needed.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the special case for 'mapie' is handled incorrectly, and the logic for counting deletions might not account for all necessary deletions in certain scenarios involving overlapping substrings.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
