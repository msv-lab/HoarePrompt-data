Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that contains the substring 'e' (from the original 'pie') and any characters before and after 'pie' except 'pi'; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
