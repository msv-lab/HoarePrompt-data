#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), n is the new length of s after all 'map' substrings have been removed, s is a string of length n that no longer contains 'map', ans is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed.

    #State: - `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified by the loop.
    #- `n` will be the new length of `s` after all "pie" substrings have been removed.
    #- `s` will no longer contain any occurrences of "pie".
    #- `ans` will be the total number of times "pie" was found and removed.
    #
    #Since the exact string `s` and the number of "pie" occurrences are not provided, we can only describe the final state in terms of these variables.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of times "pie" was found and removed from the string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' from `s`, counting how many times each was removed, and returns the total count of these removals.
