The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables or conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Additionally, the string s is not equal to 'mapie'; `ans` is 0.**
