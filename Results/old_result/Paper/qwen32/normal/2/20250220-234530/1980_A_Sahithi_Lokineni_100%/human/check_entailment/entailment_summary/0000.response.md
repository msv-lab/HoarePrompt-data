### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It also reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Default Dictionary Setup:**
   - A default dictionary `d` is initialized using `defaultdict(default_value)`, but the `default_value` function is not defined anywhere in the code. This part seems problematic.
   - Manually initializes counts for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') to zero.

3. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - Iterates over the string `s` and increments the count for each difficulty level found in the string.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - For each difficulty level, it checks if the count is less than or equal to `m`. If so, it adds the difference (`m - d[val]`) to `ans`, which represents the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the total number of additional problems needed across all difficulty levels.

5. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary mentions that `func_1()` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0. However, this function is not used anywhere in the main logic of the program. It seems irrelevant to the functionality of the program.

6. **Issues Identified:**
   - The `default_value` function is undefined, which would cause an error when trying to access a key that doesn't exist in the dictionary. However, since the code manually initializes all keys, this issue might not arise in practice.
   - The logic for calculating the additional problems needed is flawed. The condition `if d[val] <= m:` is incorrect. It should check if the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m` (not less than or equal to `m`), because if a difficulty level already has `m` or more problems, no additional problems are needed for that level.
   - The provided output does not match the expected output for the given examples. For instance, for the first test case with `m=1` and `a='BGECDCBDED'`, the correct output should be `2` (one 'A' and one 'F'), but the code will incorrectly calculate it as `5`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the number of additional problems needed. Specifically, the condition `if d[val] <= m:` should be `if d[val] < m:`.

**Correctness: False**
