The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, the new value of `x` is `(1 + 50001) // 2`, which equals 25001. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs`, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`; if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`**.
