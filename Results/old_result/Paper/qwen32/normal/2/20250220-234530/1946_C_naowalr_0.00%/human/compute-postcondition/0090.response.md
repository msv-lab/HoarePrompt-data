The only variable in the loop head is `z`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `z` and `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` was incremented by the number of iterations, and `R` is `L + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `z` is incremented by the number of iterations in the previous loop, and we are now at the start of the next iteration, we simply need to increment `z` by 1.

State: **`L` is the final value that satisfies the condition, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by the number of iterations + 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**
