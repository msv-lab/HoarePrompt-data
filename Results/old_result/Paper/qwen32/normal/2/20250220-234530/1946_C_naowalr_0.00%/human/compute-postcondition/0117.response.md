Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`; if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
