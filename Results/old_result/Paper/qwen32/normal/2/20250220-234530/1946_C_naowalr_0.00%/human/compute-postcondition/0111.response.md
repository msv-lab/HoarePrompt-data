The code snippet provided simply reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is that `numCuts` is explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers representing the connections read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**.
