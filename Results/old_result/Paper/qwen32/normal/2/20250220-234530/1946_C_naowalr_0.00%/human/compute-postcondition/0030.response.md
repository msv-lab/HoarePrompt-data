The code snippet updates the value of `x` by calculating the average of `L` and `R` using integer division. Given the constraints and initial state, `L` can be either 1 or 50001, and `R` can be either 50001 or 100001, but they cannot both be 50001 simultaneously.

Let's consider the possible combinations:

1. If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001:
   \[
   x = (1 + 50001) // 2 = 50002 // 2 = 25001
   \]

2. If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001:
   \[
   x = (50001 + 100001) // 2 = 150002 // 2 = 75001
   \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `L` is either 1 or 50001 but not both `L` and `R` are 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001 but not both `L` and `R` are 50001; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or 0; `x` is either 25001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**.
