The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the adjacency list `adj` by adding the element `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the connection between nodes `a` and `b` is established in one direction (from `a` to `b`).

Given the initial state:
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a`.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.

After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, the list `adj[a]` now includes `b` in addition to whatever elements it previously contained. The other parts of the state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a`, and now `adj[a]` also includes `b` (potentially a duplicate if `b` was already in `adj[a]`); `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
