Output State: **`L` is 50001 and `R` is 75001, or `L` is 1 and `R` is 25001; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001 or 25001; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `R` is updated to the value of `x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
