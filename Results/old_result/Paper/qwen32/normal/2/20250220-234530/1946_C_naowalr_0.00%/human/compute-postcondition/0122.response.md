Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 25001, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**

In natural language: The value of `L` has been updated to 25001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
