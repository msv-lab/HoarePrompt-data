Postcondition: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`, or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.**
