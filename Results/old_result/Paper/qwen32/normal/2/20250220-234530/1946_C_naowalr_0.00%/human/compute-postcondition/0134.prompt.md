Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where each sublist contains the vertices adjacent to the corresponding vertex; `n` is the number of vertices in the tree; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; `t` is an integer read from the standard input.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, and `R` is `L + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `L` is the final value that satisfies the condition, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by the number of iterations, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `L` is the final lower bound determined by the loop, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts determined by the last iteration of the loop, and `leftover` is the final leftover value determined by the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
