The code sets the variable `R` to the value of `x`. Given that `x` is 25001, `R` is updated to 25001. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 1, `R` is 25001, `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
