The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `adj`. This means that the list `adj[a]` will now include `b` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `adj`. Specifically, the sublist at index `a` of `adj` will now contain `b` as an additional element.

Output State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `b` includes `a` in addition to its previous elements and now the sublist at index `a` also includes `b`, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is now `i + 1` and `a` and `b` are the new integers read from input.**
