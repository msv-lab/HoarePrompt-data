To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `R - L > 1`. This means that for the loop to continue executing, the difference between `R` and `L` must be greater than 1.

Given the possible values for `L` and `R`:
- `L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is either 100001 or 75001, or 
- `L` is 1 or 25001, and `R` is 50001 or 25001.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, then `R - L = 50000`, which satisfies `R - L > 1`.
2. If `L` is 75001 and `R` is 100001, then `R - L = 25000`, which satisfies `R - L > 1`.
3. If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, then `R - L = 50000`, which satisfies `R - L > 1`.
4. If `L` is 25001 and `R` is 50001, then `R - L = 25000`, which satisfies `R - L > 1`.

In all cases, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied, so the loop can certainly execute one more time without any changes to `L` and `R`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the values of `L` and `R` to ensure the loop executes one more time. We can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`L` is either 50001 or 75001, and `R` is either 100001 or 75001, or `L` is 1 or 25001, and `R` is 50001 or 25001; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001 or 25001; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**
