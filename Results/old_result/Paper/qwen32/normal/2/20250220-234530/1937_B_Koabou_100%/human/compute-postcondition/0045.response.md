Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`. `_` is 1. If `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `s` is `a[0][:k + 1] + a[1][k:]`, `x` is `k`, `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'` was true before the loop breaks, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[1][i:x] != s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `s`, `x`, `y`, and `i` retain their values as per the precondition.**
