The code appends a new binary string (obtained from `input()`) to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` now contains three elements: the first binary string, the second binary string, and the newly appended binary string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 Â· 10^5, the first binary string is of length `n`, the second binary string is of length `n`, the newly appended binary string is of unknown length (as it depends on the input), `a` is a list containing three elements: the first binary string, the second binary string, and the newly appended binary string, `_` is 1.**
