The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `x`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `x` now holds the same value as `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`; `_` is 1; `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`; `x` is `i`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is the current index where `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'; `y` is `i`.**
