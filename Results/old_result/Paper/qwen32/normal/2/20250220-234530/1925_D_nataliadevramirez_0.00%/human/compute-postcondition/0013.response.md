The code snippet reads `m` lines of input, where each line contains three integers, and updates the `friendships` list accordingly. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` and has been updated to the value returned by `func_1`.**
