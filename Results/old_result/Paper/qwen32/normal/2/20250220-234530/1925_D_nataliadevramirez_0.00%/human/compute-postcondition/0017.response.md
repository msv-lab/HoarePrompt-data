Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of children), `m` (an integer representing the number of pairs of friends), `k` (an integer representing the number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their friendship value). The function returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships among the children, their friendships, and the excursions. Specifically, it handles the cases where the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions fall within specified ranges and processes the friendship values accordingly.**
