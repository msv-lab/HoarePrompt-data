Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value needs to be expressed as a fraction \(\dfrac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:

1. **Friendship Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the friendship value starts at \(f_i\) and increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
   - If a pair is chosen in the \(j\)-th excursion, its contribution to the sum is \(f_i + j - 1\).
   - The sum of the friendship values for all excursions for a single pair can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Arithmetic Series Sum:**
   - If a pair is chosen in all \(k\) excursions, the sum of its contributions is:
     \[
     f_i + (f_i + 1) + (f_i + 2) + \ldots + (f_i + k - 1) = k \cdot f_i + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula is used in the program to calculate the contribution of each pair.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result needs to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\), the program uses the modulo operation appropriately.

### Program Analysis:

The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function calculates the total expected value for a given set of friendships.
- `func_2`: This function handles multiple test cases.

#### `func_1` Function:
- The function iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution using the formula \(k \cdot f_i + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).
- The result is accumulated and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### `func_2` Function:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, reads the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions.
- Reads the list of friendships.
- Calls `func_1` to calculate the result for the current test case and prints it.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Formula Application:**
   - The formula used in the program is \(k \cdot f_i + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\), which assumes that each pair is chosen in all \(k\) excursions.
   - However, the problem states that pairs are chosen randomly and independently, so each pair has a probability of \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\) of being chosen in any given excursion.
   - The correct expected value for a single pair being chosen in \(k\) excursions should consider this probability.

2. **Probability Consideration:**
   - The probability that a specific pair is chosen in a single excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in \(k\) excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected contribution of a single pair should be calculated based on this expected number of choices.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly account for the probability of each pair being chosen in the excursions. It incorrectly assumes that each pair is chosen in all \(k\) excursions, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the expected value.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
