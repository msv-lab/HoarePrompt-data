To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- **Variables Read from Input:**
  - `n`: The first integer read from the input.
  - `m`: The second integer read from the input.
  - `k`: The third integer read from the input.
  
- **List Construction:**
  - `friendships`: A list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers read from the input. This means `friendships` will look something like this: `[[a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2], ..., [am, bm, cm]]`.

- **Additional Variables:**
  - `t`: An integer greater than or equal to 0. Note that `t` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet.
  - `result`: The return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. The value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print(result)
```

### Explanation:

The `print(result)` statement will output the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is derived from the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `friendships`.

### Final Output:

Given the above explanation, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
