The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations left in the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted. However, `t` needs to be decremented by 1 to reflect the completion of the current iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after decrementing it by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
