### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the provided function summaries to ensure the correctness of the assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen.
- The result should be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) and the output should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

#### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: Each time a pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions needs to be computed.
3. **Fraction Representation**: The result should be represented as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \), and the output is \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Iterates through each friendship and adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result.
  - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
  - However, the contribution of a pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f` chosen `x` times out of `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f+x-1) \).
  - The sum of this series is \( x \cdot f + \frac{x(x-1)}{2} \).
  - Since each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently, the expected number of times a pair is chosen is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \) (where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs).
  - Therefore, the expected contribution of a pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f` is:
    \[
    \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \cdot f + \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} - 1 \right)}{2} \right)
    \]
  - Simplifying, the expected contribution is:
    \[
    \frac{k \cdot f}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
    \]

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the input for multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - Prints the result for each test case.

#### Correctness Check:
The provided code in `func_1` incorrectly calculates the contribution of each friendship using `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`. This is not the correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

The correct formula should account for the expected number of times each pair is chosen and the resulting arithmetic series sum.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided program is indeed incorrect due to the incorrect formula used in `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
