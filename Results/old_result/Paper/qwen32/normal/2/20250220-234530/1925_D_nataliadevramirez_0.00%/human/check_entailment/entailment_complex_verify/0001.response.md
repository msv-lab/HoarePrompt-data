### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations provided to ensure our understanding aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. Specifically, if a pair of friends is chosen `x` times, its contribution to the sum is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from its initial friendship value `f` and increasing by 1 each time it is chosen.

#### Key Mathematical Insight:
For a pair of friends with initial friendship value `f` chosen `x` times, the total contribution to the sum is:
\[ f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f+x-1) \]

This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ \text{Sum} = x \cdot f + \frac{x(x-1)}{2} \]

In the context of the problem, since each pair can be chosen up to `k` times, the expected contribution for each pair over `k` excursions is:
\[ k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]

However, the probability that a specific pair is chosen in any given excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(m\) is the number of friend pairs and \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs. Since the excursions are independent and equiprobable, the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is:
\[ \frac{km}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Thus, the expected contribution for each pair over `k` excursions is:
\[ \left(\frac{km}{\binom{n}{2}}\right) \cdot f + \frac{\left(\frac{km}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)\left(\frac{km}{\binom{n}{2}} - 1\right)}{2} \]

But the problem simplifies this by assuming that each pair is chosen exactly `k` times on average, leading to the formula:
\[ k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the formula:
\[ f \cdot \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right) \]

This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the increase in friendship value over multiple selections. The correct formula should be:
\[ k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]

#### Annotations Review:
The annotations describe the state of the program accurately but do not highlight the error in the formula used. They correctly state that the function calculates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all pairs of friends, which is indeed incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct in identifying that the formula used in `func_1` is incorrect. The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
