To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs and generates its output based on the provided logic.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`.
- Otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` and printed the corresponding result for each case. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration, but these specific values are not part of the overall output state since they change with each iteration.

The overall output state is simply the series of printed results from each iteration. Since the problem does not specify how to aggregate these results into a single output state, we can consider the final output state to be the sequence of outputs generated by each iteration.

### Final Output State:
The output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is the sequence of results printed for each of the `t` test cases.

Output State: **The sequence of results printed for each of the `t` test cases.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the list of numbers printed by the loop for each set of inputs. Each number corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop based on the given formula.
