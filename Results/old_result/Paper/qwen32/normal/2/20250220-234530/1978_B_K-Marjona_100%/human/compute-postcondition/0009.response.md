The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means that the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now set to whatever integers were provided in the input.

The initial state mentioned the conditions for `k`, but since `k` is not updated or recalculated in the given code snippet, its value remains as described in the initial state. However, since `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned, the conditions for `k` need to be re-evaluated based on these new values.

Given the code:
```python
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

The Output State is:
Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a` if `b` is greater than `a`, otherwise `k` is the minimum of `n` and 0.**

In simpler terms, `n`, `a`, and `b` are now the integers provided in the input, and `k` is calculated based on these new values according to the given conditions.
