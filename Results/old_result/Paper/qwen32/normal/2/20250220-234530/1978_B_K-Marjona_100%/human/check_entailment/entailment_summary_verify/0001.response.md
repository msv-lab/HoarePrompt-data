### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Promotion Details:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) such that \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at prices decreasing from \( b \) to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selecting the optimal \( k \).

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The code processes multiple test cases, each defined by \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

1. **Calculation of \( k \):**
   - The code sets \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).
   - This ensures that \( k \) does not exceed the number of buns \( n \) or the difference \( b - a \).

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If \( b \le a \):
     - The promotional price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
     - Profit = \( a \times n \).
   - Otherwise:
     - The profit from the first \( k \) buns is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series: \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \).
     - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is \( (n - k) \times a \).
     - Total Profit = \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

#### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the calculations for the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)
   - \( k = \min(4, 5 - 4) = 1 \)
   - Profit = \( 5 \times 1 - \frac{1 \times (1 - 1)}{2} + (4 - 1) \times 4 = 5 + 12 = 17 \)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
   - \( k = \min(5, 9 - 5) = 4 \)
   - Profit = \( 9 \times 4 - \frac{4 \times (4 - 1)}{2} + (5 - 4) \times 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35 \)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \)
   - Since \( b \le a \), Profit = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
   - \( k = \min(5, 11 - 5) = 5 \)
   - Profit = \( 11 \times 5 - \frac{5 \times (5 - 1)}{2} + (5 - 5) \times 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45 \)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: \( n = 1000000000 \), \( a = 1000000000 \), \( b = 1000000000 \)
   - Since \( b == a \), Profit = \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: \( n = 1000000000 \), \( a = 1000000000 \), \( b = 1 \)
   - Since \( b < a \), Profit = \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: \( n = 1000 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1000 \)
   - \( k = \min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999 \)
   - Profit = \( 1000 \times 999 - \frac{999 \times (999 - 1)}{2} + (1000 - 999) \times 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500 \)

All test cases align with the expected results, confirming that the logic in the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
