To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `k` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b - a` if `b` is greater than `a`; otherwise, `k` is 0.

2. **Expression inside the print statement:**
   - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`

Let's analyze each part of the expression:

- **Part 1: `b * k`**
  - This is simply the product of `b` and `k`.

- **Part 2: `- k * (k - 1) // 2`**
  - This term represents the sum of the first `k-1` integers, subtracted from the previous term. The formula `k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers.

- **Part 3: `+ (n - k) * a`**
  - This term is the product of `(n - k)` and `a`.

Now, combining these parts, the expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` can be interpreted as follows:

- If `b > a`, `k` is the smaller of `n` and `b - a`. This means we are considering up to `k` elements where the value is `b`, and the remaining `n - k` elements where the value is `a`.
- If `b <= a`, `k` is 0, meaning all `n` elements have the value `a`.

Given this understanding, the output can be described as:

- When `b > a`:
  - We take the minimum of `n` and `b - a` elements with value `b`, then subtract the sum of the first `k-1` integers (which adjusts for the overlapping counts), and add the remaining `n - k` elements with value `a`.

- When `b <= a`:
  - Since `k` is 0, the entire expression simplifies to `n * a`.

Therefore, the output can be precisely described as:

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a if b > a, otherwise k is 0)**
