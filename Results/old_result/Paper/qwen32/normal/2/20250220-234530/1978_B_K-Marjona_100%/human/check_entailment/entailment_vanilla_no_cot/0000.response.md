To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob aims to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns under specific pricing rules:
- He can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) where `b` is the price of the first bun sold at a modified price.
- For the first `k` buns, the price of the i-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
- For the remaining `(n - k)` buns, the price is `a` coins each.

### Program Logic:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`:**
   - It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the difference between `b` and `a`.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The total profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit calculation involves two parts:
     - The sum of prices for the first `k` buns: This is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`: This is `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
     - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (matches expected)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
     - Profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (matches expected)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
     - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (matches expected)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
     - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (matches expected)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
     - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches expected)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
     - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches expected)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
     - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 499500 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (matches expected)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
