### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

#### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Understanding the Promotion**:
   - Bob can choose an integer `k` (where `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`).
   - The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

3. **Logic in the Code**:
   - The code reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the difference between `b` and `a`.
   - If `b <= a`, it means selling at the modified price would not be beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total profit using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = (b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}) + ((n - k) \times a)
     \]
     - The first part `(b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2})` calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`.
     - The second part `((n - k) \times a)` calculates the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Verification with Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (`n=4, a=4, b=5`):
     - `k = min(4, 5-4) = 1`
     - Profit = `(5*1 - 0) + (4-1)*4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - For the second test case (`n=5, a=5, b=9`):
     - `k = min(5, 9-5) = 4`
     - Profit = `(9*4 - 6) + (5-4)*5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - For the third test case (`n=10, a=10, b=5`):
     - `k = min(10, 5-10) = 0`
     - Profit = `10*10 = 100`
   - For the fourth test case (`n=5, a=5, b=11`):
     - `k = min(5, 11-5) = 5`
     - Profit = `(11*5 - 10) + (5-5)*5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
   - For the fifth test case (`n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000`):
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000-1000000000) = 0`
     - Profit = `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - For the sixth test case (`n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1`):
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1-1000000000) = 0`
     - Profit = `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - For the seventh test case (`n=1000, a=1, b=1000`):
     - `k = min(1000, 1000-1) = 999`
     - Profit = `(1000*999 - 998*999/2) + (1000-999)*1 = 499500 + 1 = 500500`

All these calculations match the expected outputs provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
