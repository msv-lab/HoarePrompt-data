You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value based on these integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b` and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - Bob can choose an integer `k` such that `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can make by choosing the optimal `k`.

3. **Logic in the Code:**
   - For each test case, the code reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is because the maximum possible value of `k` is constrained by both the number of buns `n` and the difference between the initial promotional price `b` and the usual price `a`.
   - If `b <= a`, it means the promotional price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. Hence, the profit is simply `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit calculation involves:
     - Selling the first `k` buns at the promotional prices, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - Selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`: `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Verification with Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
     - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
     - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * 0 // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - **Test Case 2:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
     - Profit = `9 * 4 - 4 * 3 // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - **Test Case 3:** `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
     - `b <= a`, so Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
   - **Test Case 4:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
     - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * 4 // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
   - **Test Case 5:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
     - `b == a`, so Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - **Test Case 6:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
     - `b < a`, so Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - **Test Case 7:** `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
     - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
     - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * 998 // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`

All these test cases match the expected outputs, indicating that the logic in the program is correct.
