The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are being assigned new values from the input, their previous values (if any) are overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
