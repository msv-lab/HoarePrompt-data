The code increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was initially 0, it will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 2, `tc` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, the list contains [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i-1), 2^(i+1), ..., 524288], `i` is 1**.
