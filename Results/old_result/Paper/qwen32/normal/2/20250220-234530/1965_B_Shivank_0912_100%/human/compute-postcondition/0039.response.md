Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `tc` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, the list contains `[k - (1 << i_final), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i_final), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i_final - 1), 2^(i_final + 1), ..., 524288]`, `i` is `i_final` where `i_final` is the largest integer such that `2^(i_final + 1) <= k`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`. If `j` is equal to `i`, `ans` remains `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.**
