To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- The list `ans` is described as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i-1), 2^(i+1), ..., 524288]`.

Let's break down the components of this list:
1. **First Three Elements**:
   - `k - (1 << i)`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`

2. **Subsequent Elements**:
   - Powers of 2 starting from `2^0` up to `2^(i-1)`, excluding `2^i` if it exists within the range.
   - Powers of 2 starting from `2^(i+1)` up to `2^19` (since `524288 = 2^19`).

### Counting the Elements:
1. **First Three Elements**: There are exactly 3 elements.
2. **Powers of 2**:
   - From `2^0` to `2^(i-1)`: This gives us `i` elements.
   - From `2^(i+1)` to `2^19`: This gives us `19 - (i + 1) + 1 = 19 - i` elements.

Combining these, the total number of elements in the list `ans` is:
\[ 3 + i + (19 - i) = 3 + 19 = 22 \]

### Conclusion:
The length of the list `ans` is always 22 regardless of the values of `k` and `i`.

Therefore, the `print(len(ans))` statement will print the integer `22`.

Output: **22**
