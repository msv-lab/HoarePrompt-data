To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and derive the necessary values step-by-step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `n`: First input integer (not directly used in the calculation of `ans`)
   - `k`: Second input integer
   - `tc`: Incremented by 1 (not directly used in the calculation of `ans`)
   - `t`: Remains the same (not directly used in the calculation of `ans`)
   - `i`: Calculated as the largest integer such that \(1 \leq i\) and \(1 << (i + 1)\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`
   - `ans`: A list constructed based on `k` and `i`

2. **Construction of `ans`:**
   - `ans` starts with three elements: 
     - `k - (1 << i)`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
   - Then, for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`, `1 << j` is added to `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \leq i\) and \(1 << (i + 1)\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`.
   - This means \(2^{(i+1)} > k\) and \(2^i \leq k\).

2. **Construct `ans`:**
   - Start with the three initial elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
   - Add `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`.

3. **Count Elements in `ans`:**
   - There are 3 initial elements.
   - From `j = 0` to `j = 19`, there are 20 possible values of `j`.
   - Since `j = i` is excluded, there are \(20 - 1 = 19\) additional elements.
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `ans` is \(3 + 19 = 22\).

### Conclusion:

The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the list `ans`, which is 22.

Output: **22**
