To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components of the `ans` list.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List Components:**
   - `k - (1 << i)`: This represents `k` minus `2^i`.
   - `k + 1`: This is simply `k` plus 1.
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This represents `k + 1` plus `2^i`.
   - `1`: This is a constant value.
   - `2`: This is a constant value.
   - `4`: This is a constant value.
   - `...`: This indicates a sequence of powers of 2.
   - `2^(i-1)`: This is `2` raised to the power of `(i-1)`.
   - `2^(i+1)`: This is `2` raised to the power of `(i+1)`.
   - `...`: This indicates a sequence of powers of 2 continuing up to `524288`.

2. **Sequence of Powers of 2:**
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^19` (since `2^19 = 524288`).

### Analysis of `ans` List:

The `ans` list is constructed from the above components. Let's denote it explicitly:

\[ \text{ans} = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{(i-1)}, 2^{(i+1)}, \ldots, 524288] \]

### Explanation of Values:

- `k - (1 << i)`: This is `k - 2^i`.
- `k + 1`: This is `k + 1`.
- `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This is `k + 1 + 2^i`.
- The subsequent elements are the powers of 2 from `1` to `524288`, excluding `2^i`.

### Final Output:

When the `print(*ans)` statement is executed, it will print all the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces. Given the structure of the `ans` list, the output will include the specific values derived from `k` and `i`, followed by the sequence of powers of 2.

### Formatted Output:

Output: **k - 2^i, k + 1, k + 1 + 2^i, 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(i-1), 2^(i+1), ..., 524288 (where k is a given integer, i is a given integer, and the sequence includes all powers of 2 from 1 to 524288 excluding 2^i)**
