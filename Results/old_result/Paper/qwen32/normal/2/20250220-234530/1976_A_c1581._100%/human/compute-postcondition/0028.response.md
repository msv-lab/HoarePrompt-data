Postcondition: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1. If `i` is less than the length of `digits` minus 1 and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return and continues executing.**
