The code appends the character `char` to the list `digits`. Since `digits` already contains at least one element (`char`), appending `char` again means `digits` will now contain two occurrences of `char`.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing at least two elements, both of which are the digit `char`; `letters` is an empty list.**
