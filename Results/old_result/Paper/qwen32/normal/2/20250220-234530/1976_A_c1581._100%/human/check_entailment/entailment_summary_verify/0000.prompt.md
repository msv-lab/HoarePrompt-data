You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if the given password string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before any letters, both groups are individually sorted in ascending order, and the last digit is not greater than any letter. It returns `True` if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter in the password. The code checks if the sorted digits and letters combined form the original password, but it does not ensure that the digits appear only after all letters in the original password.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
a1b2c
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

Explanation of the failure:
- The password "a1b2c" has letters followed by digits, but the digits are not in non-decreasing order relative to each other, and the letters are not in non-decreasing order relative to each other. However, the main issue is that there are digits after letters, which violates the condition.
- The code will sort the digits and letters separately and then combine them, resulting in "abc12", which matches the sorted version of the password. However, this does not mean the original password meets the criteria of having no digits after letters.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that all letters come before any digits in the original password, and both the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if all letters come before any digits
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in password[:len(letters)]):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters and digits are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters) or digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function ensures that the conditions are met properly.
