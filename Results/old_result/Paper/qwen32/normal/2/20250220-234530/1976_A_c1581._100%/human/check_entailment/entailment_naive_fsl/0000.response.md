Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter in the password. The code checks if the sorted digits and letters combined form the original password, but it does not ensure that the digits appear only after all letters in the original password.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
a1b2c
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

Explanation of the failure:
- The password "a1b2c" has letters followed by digits, but the digits are not in non-decreasing order relative to each other, and the letters are not in non-decreasing order relative to each other. However, the main issue is that there are digits after letters, which violates the condition.
- The code will sort the digits and letters separately and then combine them, resulting in "abc12", which matches the sorted version of the password. However, this does not mean the original password meets the criteria of having no digits after letters.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that all letters come before any digits in the original password, and both the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if all letters come before any digits
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in password[:len(letters)]):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters and digits are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters) or digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function ensures that the conditions are met properly.
