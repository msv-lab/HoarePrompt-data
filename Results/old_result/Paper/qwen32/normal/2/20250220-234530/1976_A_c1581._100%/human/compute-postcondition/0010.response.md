The code appends the character `char` to the `letters` list. Given the initial conditions, `char` is not a digit, so `digits` remains an empty list. Since `char` is appended to `letters`, the `letters` list now contains one additional element, making its length increase by one.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing one more element, which is `char`.**
