### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Separation and Sorting**:
   - The program separates the digits and letters into two lists (`digits` and `letters`).
   - It then sorts both lists individually.
   
2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the digits list is sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is redundant since the list is already sorted.
   - It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter, ensuring that no digit comes after a letter. However, this check alone is not sufficient. The program needs to ensure that no digit appears after any letter in the original password sequence.
   - It concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares this with the original password. This check is also insufficient because it does not ensure that the digits and letters are in their respective sorted positions within the original password.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter. It only checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter, which is insufficient. For example, in the case of "a1b2", the program would incorrectly consider it valid because '1' < 'b'.
   - The program does not ensure that the digits and letters are in their respective sorted positions within the original password. It only checks if the concatenated sorted string matches the original password, which does not guarantee that the digits are followed by letters and both are in sorted order.

#### Correct Approach:
- We need to ensure that all digits appear before any letters in the password.
- We need to check that the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We need to check that the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We can achieve this by iterating through the password once and checking these conditions.

#### Revisiting the Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` checks if the given password string is already sorted such that all digits come before any letters, both groups are individually sorted in ascending order, and the last digit is not greater than any letter. However, the function does not correctly implement these checks as described.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the problem requirements. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
