Postcondition: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2. If `i` is less than the second-to-last index of `digits` and `digits[i]` is greater than `digits[i + 1]`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues executing.**
