Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
A strong password must satisfy:
1. Consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code uses a function `func_1` to determine if a password is strong. Here is the function's logic:
1. It separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
2. It sorts both lists.
3. It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter (if both exist).
4. It constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
5. It compares this constructed password with the original password and returns `True` if they match, otherwise `False`.

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary states that `func_1` checks if the password is sorted such that all digits come before any letters, both groups are individually sorted in ascending order, and the last digit is not greater than any letter. It returns `True` if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment claims that the code is incorrect because it does not ensure that all letters come before any digits in the original password. It provides a test case (`a1b2c`) to demonstrate this issue.

### Evaluation
Let's revisit the code and the function summary to see if they correctly address the problem description:

1. **Separation and Sorting**: The code correctly separates the password into digits and letters and sorts both lists.
2. **Digit Before Letter Check**: The code checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter, which is part of ensuring that all digits come after all letters. However, this check alone is insufficient.
3. **Concatenation and Comparison**: The code concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares the result with the original password. This comparison ensures that the original password must have been in the correct order (all letters before digits, both sorted).

### Key Issue
The critical issue identified in the original assessment is correct. The code does not explicitly check that no digit appears after a letter in the original password. The comparison with the concatenated sorted string does not guarantee this condition is met in the original order.

### Corrected Approach
To correctly implement the solution, we need to ensure:
- All letters come before any digits.
- Both the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1` as suggested in the original assessment:
```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if all letters come before any digits
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in password[:len(letters)]):
        return False
    
    # Check if letters and digits are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters) or digits != sorted(digits):
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description, particularly the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

Final: **False**
