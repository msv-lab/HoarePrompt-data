To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop processes each character in the `password` string.

The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string. For each character:
- If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
- If the character is a lowercase Latin letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.

Since the loop processes every character in the `password` string, after all iterations:
- The `digits` list will contain all the digits from the `password`.
- The `letters` list will contain all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password`.

Thus, the final output state is that `digits` contains all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password`.

Output State: **`digits` contains all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password`.**
