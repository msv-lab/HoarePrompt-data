Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']` if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`. `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `only_b` is a set with more than `k // 2` elements if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `only_b` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, and `total_distinct` is less than `k`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `results` list now contains an additional `'NO'`, making its length three if the condition regarding `only_b` is met; otherwise, it remains two. All other variables retain their initial values.
