The code snippet assigns a new set to `relevant_b` based on the condition `x <= k`. However, the value of `k` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact values of `relevant_b` cannot be determined. We can only express `relevant_b` as a set comprehension similar to `relevant_a`.

Given that `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` will be `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `[]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`**.
