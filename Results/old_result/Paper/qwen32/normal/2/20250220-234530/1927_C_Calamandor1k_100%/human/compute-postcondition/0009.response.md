Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `[]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `{x for x in relevant_a if x not in relevant_b}` (which results in an empty set since `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are identical), `only_b` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`. The length of `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`.**
