To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state.

Given:
- `t` is 1
- `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`
- `results` is `['NO', 'NO']` if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `results` remains `['NO']`
- `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`
- `only_a` is `set()`
- `only_b` is a set with more than `k // 2` elements if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `only_b` is `set()`
- `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`

The code snippet:
```python
total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
```

Let's calculate the value of `total_distinct`:

- `len(only_a)` is `0` because `only_a` is an empty set.
- `len(only_b)` is not explicitly given, but we know that if it has more than `k // 2` elements, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`. Since `k` is 4 (from the tuple `(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])`), `k // 2` is `2`. Therefore, `only_b` must have more than 2 elements, making its length at least 3. However, the exact number of elements in `only_b` is not specified, but it does not affect the calculation of `total_distinct` since we only need to know the lengths of the sets.
- `len(both)` is `4` because `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`.

Thus, `total_distinct` is calculated as:
\[ \text{total\_distinct} = 0 + \text{len(only\_b)} + 4 \]

Since `only_b` has more than 2 elements, let's assume the minimum possible value for `len(only_b)` which is 3 (as it must be greater than `k // 2`):
\[ \text{total\_distinct} = 0 + 3 + 4 = 7 \]

However, since the exact number of elements in `only_b` is not specified beyond it being more than 2, we can express `total_distinct` as:
\[ \text{total\_distinct} = \text{len(only\_b)} + 4 \]

Given the constraints, we can say that `total_distinct` is at least 7.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']` if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `results` remains `['NO']`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `only_b` is a set with more than `k // 2` elements if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `only_b` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`**.
