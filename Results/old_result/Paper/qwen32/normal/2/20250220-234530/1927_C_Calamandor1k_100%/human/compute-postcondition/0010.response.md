The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `['NO']`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, the length of `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`.**
