Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `[]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`**

Explanation: The variable `unique_b` is created and assigned the value of a set created from the list `[4, 5, 6, 7]`. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, `unique_b` will be `{4, 5, 6, 7}`. All other variables remain unchanged.
