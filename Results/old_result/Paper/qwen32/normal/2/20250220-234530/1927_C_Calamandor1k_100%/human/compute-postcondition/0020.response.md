The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the overall state of the program outside of the loop context. Since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement here would not have any effect on the variables or their values.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']` if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO', 'NO']`. `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `only_b` is a set with more than `k // 2` elements if the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`; otherwise, `only_b` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, and `total_distinct` is less than `k`.**
