The given code snippet appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. However, the initial state does not include the definition or any information about the `results` list. Since the task specifies that we should only consider the variables mentioned in the initial state and their changes, we will assume that `results` was not part of the initial state and thus not included in the output state.

Given that no other variables are affected by the code, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the `results` list with the string `'NO'`.

However, since `results` was not part of the initial state, we will only report the state of the variables that were initially defined.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{1, 2}`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `{1, 2}`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2**.
