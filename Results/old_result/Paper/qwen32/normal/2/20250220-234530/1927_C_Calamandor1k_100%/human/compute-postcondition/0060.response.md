The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. 

Given the initial state, `results` is initially `['YES', 'NO']` if `total_distinct` is less than `k`, otherwise it is `['YES']`. Since no changes to `total_distinct` or `k` are mentioned, we assume `total_distinct` is indeed less than `k`, making `results` initially `['YES', 'NO']`.

After appending `'YES'`, `results` becomes `['YES', 'NO', 'YES']`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 0, `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'YES']`.**
