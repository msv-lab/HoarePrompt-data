The code snippet `unique_a = set(a)` updates the value of `unique_a` to be the set of elements in list `a`. Given that `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `unique_a` will be `{8, 9, 10}`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{1, 2}`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `{1, 2}`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`**
