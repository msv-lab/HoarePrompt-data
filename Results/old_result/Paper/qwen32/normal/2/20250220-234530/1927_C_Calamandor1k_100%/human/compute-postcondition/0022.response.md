The given code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, `results` was initially `['NO', 'NO']` or `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']` depending on the condition involving `total_distinct` and `k`. After appending `'YES'`, the new state of `results` will be `['NO', 'NO', 'YES']` or `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`.

Since the exact initial state of `results` is not specified beyond the conditions, we consider both possibilities:

- If `results` was `['NO', 'NO']`, it becomes `['NO', 'NO', 'YES']`.
- If `results` was `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`, it becomes `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`.

However, since the problem specifies that `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']` if `total_distinct` is less than `k` and the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, and `['NO', 'NO']` otherwise, we should consider the more general case where `results` could be either `['NO', 'NO']` or `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`.

For simplicity and to cover the most common scenario, we'll assume the more specific condition where `results` was `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']` before the append operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`**.
