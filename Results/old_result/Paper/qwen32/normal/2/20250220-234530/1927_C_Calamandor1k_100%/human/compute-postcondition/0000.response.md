The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified or introduced. The initial state specifies several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even; each test case includes two lists: a list a of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for each i, and a list b of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6 for each j; `results` is an empty list.**
