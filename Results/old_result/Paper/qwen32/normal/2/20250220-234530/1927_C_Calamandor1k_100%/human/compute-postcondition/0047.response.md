Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`**

Explanation: The variable `only_a` is updated to be the difference between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. Since both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are initially empty sets, the result of the operation is also an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged.
