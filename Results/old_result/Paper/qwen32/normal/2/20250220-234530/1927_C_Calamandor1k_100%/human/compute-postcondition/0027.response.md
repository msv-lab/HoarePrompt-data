The code snippet updates the `relevant_b` set to include only those elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. However, the value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact elements that will be included in `relevant_b`. We can only express the new state in terms of `k`.

Given that `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` will now be `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`**

In natural language: The value of `relevant_b` is updated to include only those elements from the set `{4, 5, 6, 7}` that are less than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
