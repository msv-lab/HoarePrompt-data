Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` (with the first bit changed to '1' if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was '0'), `flag` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i]` does not equal `s[i + 1]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `flag` has been changed to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
