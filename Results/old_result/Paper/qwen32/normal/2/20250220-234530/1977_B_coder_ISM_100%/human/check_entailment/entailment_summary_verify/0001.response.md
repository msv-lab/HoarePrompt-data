Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find an array `a` of integers where each element is either 1, 0, or -1, such that:
- The sum of the array elements multiplied by powers of 2 equals the given integer `x`.
- No two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` in terms of 1s and 0s.
   - It iterates over the range 0 to 29 (since `x < 2^30`), checking if the `i`th bit of `x` is set using bitwise AND (`x & pow(2, i)`). If the bit is set, it appends '1' to `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Adjusting the Array:**
   - It uses a flag to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - If two consecutive elements are '1', it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes the '0' to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is still set after the loop, it adjusts the last element or appends a new '1' to the array.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - It ensures that no two consecutive elements are '1' by swapping '-1' with '1' if necessary.

5. **Output:**
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling of the Last Element:**
   - The logic for handling the last element when the flag is set is incorrect. Specifically, appending '1' directly without ensuring the array constraints might violate the rules.
   
2. **Conversion from String to Integer:**
   - The array `s` contains string values ('1', '0', '-1'). When printing, it should be converted to integers.

3. **Length Calculation:**
   - The length calculation might be incorrect due to the way elements are appended or modified.

### Detailed Evaluation:

Let's go through the code step-by-step and identify specific issues:

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   s = []
   length = 30
   ```
   - Initializes an empty list `s` and sets `length` to 30.

2. **Binary Conversion:**
   ```python
   for i in range(30):
       if x & pow(2, i):
           s.append('1')
       else:
           s.append('0')
   ```
   - Converts `x` to a binary string representation of length 30.

3. **Adjusting Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   ```python
   flag = 0
   for i in range(0, 29):
       if flag and s[i] == '0':
           s[i] = '1'
           flag = 0
       if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
           s[i] = '-1'
           flag = 1
       elif flag == 1:
           s[i] = '0'
       else:
           pass
   ```
   - Ensures no two consecutive elements are non-zero by adjusting the array.

4. **Final Adjustments for the Last Element:**
   ```python
   if flag and s[29] == '0':
       s[29] = '1'
   elif flag:
       s[29] = '0'
       s.append('1')
       length += 1
   ```
   - Handles the last element based on the flag. This part is problematic because it might append '1' without ensuring the constraints.

5. **Swapping '-1' and '1':**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, length):
       if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
           s[i] = '0'
           s[i - 1] = '-1'
   ```
   - Ensures no two consecutive elements are '1' by swapping '-1' with '1' if necessary.

6. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(length)
   print(*s)
   ```
   - Prints the length and the array. The array contains strings, which should be integers.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Given the identified issues, especially the incorrect handling of the last element and the conversion of array elements from strings to integers, the program is likely incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
