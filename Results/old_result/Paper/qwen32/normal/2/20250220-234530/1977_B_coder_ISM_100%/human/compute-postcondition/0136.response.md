Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 2. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is initially '0', then `s[2]` is changed to '1'. If `flag` is 1, then `s[2]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, `s[2]` remains unchanged.**
