Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` remains unchanged, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `s` has an additional element `'1'` appended to it if `x & pow(2, i)` is true. Otherwise, `s` includes an additional element `'0'`.**
