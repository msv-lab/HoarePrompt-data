The code snippet `s[i] = '1'` modifies the list `s` by changing the element at index `i` from `'0'` to `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` with leading zeros if necessary, and `i` is 0. Since `s[i]` was initially `'0'`, it is now `'1'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` with the first bit changed from '0' to '1', `flag` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0.**
