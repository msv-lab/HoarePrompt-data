Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, with the exception that if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[0]` is `'1'`. `length` is 30; `flag` is 1, `i` is 0. It is not the case that `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and both are `'1'`.**
