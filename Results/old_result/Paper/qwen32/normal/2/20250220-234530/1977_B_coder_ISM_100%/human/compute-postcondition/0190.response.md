Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0') representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), except `s[0]` is now '-1', `flag` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, and `i` is 0. Additionally, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i + 1]` is '1'.**

In natural language: The value of `flag` has been changed to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
