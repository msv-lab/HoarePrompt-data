Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, and `length` is 30.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, `s` will be a list of 30 binary digits (as strings), representing the 30 least significant bits of the integer `x`. The other variables `t` and `length` remain unchanged.
