To determine what will be printed by the `print(*s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to the list `s`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x`, with the 30th element explicitly set to '0'.
- `flag` is not 0.
- `length` is 31.

### Transformations:
- The list `s` undergoes 30 iterations.
- During each iteration, if the condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` is met, then:
  - `s[i]` is set to '0'.
  - `s[i - 1]` is set to '-1'.
- `nalla` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so `nalla` becomes 31 after 30 iterations.

### Analysis:
Given the initial state, the list `s` starts with a 30-bit binary representation of `x` followed by a '0'. Since the transformations involve changing elements from '-1' to '0' and '1' to '-1' under specific conditions, we need to consider the implications:

1. **Initial List `s`:** 
   - The list `s` initially contains 30 bits representing `x` in binary, followed by a '0'.
   - Example: If `x = 5`, the binary representation is `00000000000000000000000000000101`, and `s` would be `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.

2. **Transformations:**
   - The transformations involve checking pairs of elements `(s[i], s[i-1])` and modifying them if they match the condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')`.
   - However, since the initial list `s` only contains '0's and the binary representation of `x`, there are no '-1's present initially.
   - Therefore, the condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` will never be true during the iterations, and the list `s` will remain unchanged throughout the 30 iterations.

### Conclusion:
Since the transformations do not alter the initial list `s` due to the absence of '-1' elements, the list `s` remains the same as it was initialized.

### Final Output:
The `print(*s)` statement will print the elements of the list `s` separated by spaces.

Output: **0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (where the first 30 elements represent the 30-bit binary representation of x and the last element is '0')**
