Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and both are `'1'`, then `s[0]` is `'-1'` and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, if `flag` was 1 and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[0]` is `'1'` and `s[1]` is `'0'`, `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and `s[0]` is `'0'`. `length` is 30, and `i` is 1.**
