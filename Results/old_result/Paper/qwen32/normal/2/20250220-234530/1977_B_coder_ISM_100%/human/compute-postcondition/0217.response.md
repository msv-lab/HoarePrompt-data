Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0'), `flag` is either 1 or 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, `i` is 2. If `flag` was 1 and `s[2]` was '0', then `s[2]` is now '1' and `flag` is now 0. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, then `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.**
