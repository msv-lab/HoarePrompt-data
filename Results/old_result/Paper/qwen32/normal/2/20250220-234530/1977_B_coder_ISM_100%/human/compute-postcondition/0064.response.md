Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of strings where consecutive `'1'`s have been replaced with `'-1'` followed by `'0'`s, and any `'0'` encountered when `flag` is 1 has been flipped to `'1'`. If `flag` is 1, `s` has 31 strings with `s[29]` being `'0'` and `s[30]` being `'1'`, and `length` is 32. Otherwise, `s` has 30 strings, and `length` is 30. `flag` remains 0 if the if condition is not met.**
