Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0') representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), `flag` is not 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 characters, each being either '1' or '0'. These characters represent the binary form of the integer `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost). The other variables (`t`, `flag`, `length`, and `nalla`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
