Output State: **`a` is `l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `l[x+1]` if `l[x+1]` is greater than the previous `b`, or 0 if no such element exists., `c` is 1 if `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0., `n` is the input integer., `l` is the list of integers read from input., `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, `x` is `x + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to `l[x]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
