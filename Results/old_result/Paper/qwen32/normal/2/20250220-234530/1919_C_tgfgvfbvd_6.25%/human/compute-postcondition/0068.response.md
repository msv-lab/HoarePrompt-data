Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 0, `x` is 2. If `l[2] < a` and `l[2] < b`, then either `a` is set to `l[2]` if `a - l[2] <= b - l[2]`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[2]`. If `l[2]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` remains unchanged if `a >= l[2]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[2]`.**
