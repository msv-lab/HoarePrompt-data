Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `c` is unchanged.**
