Postcondition: **`a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[2]` if `l[2]` is greater than `l[1]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `c` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `y` is 3. If `l[3]` is greater than `l[2]`, then `b` is updated to `l[3]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b`.**
