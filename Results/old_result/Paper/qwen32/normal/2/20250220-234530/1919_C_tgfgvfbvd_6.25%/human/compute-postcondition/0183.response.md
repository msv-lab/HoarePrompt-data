Postcondition: **`a` is `l[0]`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than `a` and `l[x]` is not less than `b`.**
