Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, and `y` is less than `n-1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to `1`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to `0`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` holds true; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` remains `l[x]` if `a` is equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[0]` and `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
