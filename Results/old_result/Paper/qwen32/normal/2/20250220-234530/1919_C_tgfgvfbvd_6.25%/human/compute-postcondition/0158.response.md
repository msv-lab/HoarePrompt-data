Output State: **`a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[2]`, `c` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `y` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
