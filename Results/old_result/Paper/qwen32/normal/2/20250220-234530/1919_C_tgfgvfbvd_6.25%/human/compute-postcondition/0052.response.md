The value of `a` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Given that `x` is 1, `a` will be equal to the second element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `y` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is `l[1]`**.
