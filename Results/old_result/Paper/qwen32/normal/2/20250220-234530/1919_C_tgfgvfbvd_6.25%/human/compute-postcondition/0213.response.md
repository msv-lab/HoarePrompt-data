Postcondition: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]` if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b`, otherwise `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x+1]`. `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a < l[x] - b` or if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b` or if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. `c` is 3 if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b`, otherwise `c` is 2 if `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 1 if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` or `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, and `x` is `x + 1`.**
