Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 2, `b` is the third element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
