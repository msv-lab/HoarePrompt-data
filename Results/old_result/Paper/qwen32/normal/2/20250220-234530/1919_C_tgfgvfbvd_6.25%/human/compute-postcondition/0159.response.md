Postcondition: **`a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[2]` if `l[2]` is greater than `l[1]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `c` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `y` is 2. If `l[y]` (which is `l[2]`) is greater than `l[y - 1]` (which is `l[1]`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `l`, or `y`.**
