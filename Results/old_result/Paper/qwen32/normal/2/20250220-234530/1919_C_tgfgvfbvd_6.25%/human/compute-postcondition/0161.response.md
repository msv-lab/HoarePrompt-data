Output State: **`a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[3]`, `c` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from input, and `y` is 3**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be `l[3]` because the code assigns `l[y]` to `b`, and `y` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
