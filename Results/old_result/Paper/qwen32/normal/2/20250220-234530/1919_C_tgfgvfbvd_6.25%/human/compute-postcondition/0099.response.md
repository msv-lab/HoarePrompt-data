Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `c` is `0`, and `y` is less than `n-1`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.**
