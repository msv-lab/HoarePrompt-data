In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer value read from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). The loop variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable since the loop body is omitted.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the input and how it affects the range function in the for loop. Specifically, we need to ensure that `t` (the number of test cases) is at least 1, as this will make the range non-empty and allow the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the result of `int(input())`, which should be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs.

2. **Adjusting the State**: Given that `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the state before the loop should already satisfy the condition for the loop to execute. However, we need to explicitly state that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run.

3. **No Other Adjustments Needed**: Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway and does not affect the loop execution condition, no other adjustments are necessary.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1. Here is the final state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
