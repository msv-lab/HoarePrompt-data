Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `c` is `0`, `y` is `1`, `b` is `l[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
