Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `c` is `0`, and `y` is less than `n-1`. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` holds true, then `a` is `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[x]`.**
