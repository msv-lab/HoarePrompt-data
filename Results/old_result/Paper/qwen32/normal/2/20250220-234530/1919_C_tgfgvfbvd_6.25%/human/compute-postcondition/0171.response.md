Postcondition: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor or `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[x]`.**
