The list `l` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
