To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i` and the range parameter `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `k` is the third integer from the input
- `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input
- `s` is 0
- `c` is `k * k / 2`
- `i` is `n + 1`

We need to adjust the state so that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `i` is set to `n + 1` initially, but since `i` is reassigned in the loop, its initial value does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`, `i` is `n + 1`**
