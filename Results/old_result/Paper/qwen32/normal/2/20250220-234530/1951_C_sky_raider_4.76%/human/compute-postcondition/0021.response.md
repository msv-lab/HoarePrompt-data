The code snippet assigns new values to `n`, `m`, and `k` by reading an input line and splitting it into three integers. This means the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations; `l` is unchanged; `s` is the value from the last iteration; `c` is the accumulated value after all iterations; `i` is `i + 1`.**
