The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `l` by reading a line of input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given that `l` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, the output state should reflect this change while keeping other variables as they were.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `s` is the value from the last iteration; `c` is the accumulated value after all iterations; `i` is `i + 1`.**
