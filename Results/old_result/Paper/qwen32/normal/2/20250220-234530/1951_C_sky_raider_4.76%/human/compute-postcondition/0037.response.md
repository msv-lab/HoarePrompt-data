To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
```

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `c` is updated by adding the result of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
- `i`, `n`, `s`, and `k` are used in the expression but their values are not changed.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `k` is `k - s`

The only variable that changes is `c`. The new value of `c` is its old value plus the result of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`**.
