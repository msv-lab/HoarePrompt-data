The code snippet reassigns the value of `s` to `min(m, k)`. Since `s` was already defined as `min(m, k)` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `s`. Therefore, no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is reduced by `min(m, k)`; `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`; `i` is `i + 1`**
