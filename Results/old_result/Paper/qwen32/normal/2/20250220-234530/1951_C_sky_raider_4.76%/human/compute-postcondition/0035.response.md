The given code snippet assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to the variable `s`. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`

The new variable `s` is introduced and assigned the value of `min(m, k)`. Since the values of `m` and `k` are not specified, `s` will take the minimum of whatever values `m` and `k` hold.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
