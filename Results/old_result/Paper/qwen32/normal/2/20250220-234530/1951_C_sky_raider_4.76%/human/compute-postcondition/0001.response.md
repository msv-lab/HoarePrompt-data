The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
