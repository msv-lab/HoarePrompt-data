To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`
- `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[0] * s - s * s`
- `i` is 0 (at the start of the first iteration)

After the first iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it determines the total number of iterations.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * l[0] * s - s * s`, `i` is 1**
