Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `g` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, and `kp`) retain their initial values, except that `kp` has been incremented by 1.
