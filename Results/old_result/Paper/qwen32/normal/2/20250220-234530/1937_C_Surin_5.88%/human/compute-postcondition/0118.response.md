The code snippet `r = input('')` assigns a new value to the variable `r` by taking input from the user. This overwrites the previous value of `r`, which was described as "the input string". All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i + 1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
