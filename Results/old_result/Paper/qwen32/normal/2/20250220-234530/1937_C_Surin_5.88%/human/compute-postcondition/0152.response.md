Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, n is greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is the index of the maximum element in the array, v2 is n-1, prev is the index of the maximum element in the array, kp is equal to t.**

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions hold:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, as specified initially.
- `n` is still the input integer representing the size of the permutation array, and it is greater than 1.
- `g` remains 0 throughout the loop and does not change.
- `v1` holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation array. This is determined by the first inner loop, which finds the largest element by comparing pairs.
- `v2` is set to `n-1` during the last iteration of the inner loop but is not relevant to the final output state.
- `prev` also holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation array. This is confirmed by the second inner loop, which verifies the maximum element found in the first loop.
- `kp` equals `t`, meaning the loop has executed exactly `t` times, one for each test case.
