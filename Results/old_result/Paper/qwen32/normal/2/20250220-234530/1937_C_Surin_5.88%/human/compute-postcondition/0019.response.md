The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is initially set to `i`, after this assignment, `v1` will also hold the value `i`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
- `g` remains 0.
- `v2` remains `i`.
- `v1` is now `i` (previously `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` was 0, but this is overwritten).
- `r` remains the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i`, `r` is the user input.**
