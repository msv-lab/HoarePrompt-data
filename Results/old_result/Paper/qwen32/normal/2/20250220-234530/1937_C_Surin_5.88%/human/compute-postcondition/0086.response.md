Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and `r` is either '>' or '<'.**
