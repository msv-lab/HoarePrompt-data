Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `r` is the input character (either '>' or '<'), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
