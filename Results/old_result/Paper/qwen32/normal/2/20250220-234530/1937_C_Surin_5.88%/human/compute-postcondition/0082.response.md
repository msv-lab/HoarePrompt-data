The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration**.
