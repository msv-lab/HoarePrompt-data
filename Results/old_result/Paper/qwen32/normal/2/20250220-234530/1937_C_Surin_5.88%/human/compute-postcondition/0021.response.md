To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1 (This variable is part of the loop head, but its value does not change from one iteration to the next.)
- `g` is 0 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.)
- `v2` is `i` (This variable is not part of the loop head, but its value will be updated based on the current value of `i`.)
- `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0 (This variable is not part of the loop head, but its value will be updated based on the current value of `i` and the condition involving `r`.)

The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the adjustments needed:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- The values of `t`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged, but `v2` will be set to the new value of `i`, and `v1` will be set to the new value of `i` if `r` equals `<`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i + 1`, `v1` is `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
