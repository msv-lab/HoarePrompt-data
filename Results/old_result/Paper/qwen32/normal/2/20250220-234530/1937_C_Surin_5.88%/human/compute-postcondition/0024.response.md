The provided Python code snippet includes `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer for the standard output. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program; it only ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v2`, `v1`, `i`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i + 1`, `v1` is `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.
