Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases but does not directly influence the current print statement.
2. **n**: Greater than 1. This variable represents the size of the array.
3. **g**: Set to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
4. **v1**: The index of the maximum element in the array. Since we do not have the array itself, we cannot determine the exact index, but we know it is the position of the largest element.
5. **v2**: Set to \(n-1\). This variable is not used in the print statement.
6. **prev**: The index of the maximum element in the array. Similar to \(v1\), this is the position of the largest element in the array.
7. **kp**: Set to \(n-1\). This variable is not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `prev` is the index of the maximum element in the array.
- `v1` is also the index of the maximum element in the array.

Since both `prev` and `v1` represent the same value (the index of the maximum element in the array), the print statement will output the same value for both variables.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **! [index_of_max_element] [index_of_max_element] (where index_of_max_element is the index of the maximum element in the array)**

However, since we do not have the specific array, we cannot provide the exact numerical value for `index_of_max_element`. Therefore, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev and v1 are the index of the maximum element in the array)**
