The code snippet reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `r`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
