To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `kp` is initialized to `n-1`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `r` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we can infer that it must be defined elsewhere in the code that isn't shown here.
- Since `v1` and `prev` depend on the values of `r` at different indices, their values cannot be determined precisely without knowing the contents of `r`.
- `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r[i] == '<'`, or 0 if no such index exists.
- `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r[i] == '>'`, or 0 if no such index exists.

### Analysis:
Given the lack of specific information about `r`, we can only provide a general description of the output based on the conditions provided:

- If `r` contains no '<' characters, `v1` will be 0.
- If `r` contains no '>' characters, `prev` will be 0.

Thus, the output will depend on the values of `prev` and `v1` which are derived from the contents of `r`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact contents of `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `prev` and `v1`:

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the highest index i where r[i] == '>', or 0 if no such index exists, and v1 is the highest index i where r[i] == '<', or 0 if no such index exists)**
