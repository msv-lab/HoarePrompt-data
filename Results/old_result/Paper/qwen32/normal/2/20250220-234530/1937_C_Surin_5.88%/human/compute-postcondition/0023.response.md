Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v2` is set to `i + 1`.
- `v1` is set to `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Value of `v2`:**
   - `v2` is explicitly set to `i + 1`. Therefore, `v2` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.

2. **Value of `v1`:**
   - `v1` is set to `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, it remains 0.
   - Since the value of `r` is not provided, we need to consider both possibilities:
     - If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` will also be `i + 1`.
     - If `r` does not equal `<`, then `v1` will be 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

- The format string includes four placeholders for `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.
- Given the two possible scenarios for `v1`:
  - If `r` equals `<`, `v1` will be `i + 1`.
  - If `r` does not equal `<`, `v1` will be 0.
- `v2` will always be `i + 1`.

### Possible Outputs:
1. **If `r` equals `<`:**
   - `v1` will be `i + 1`.
   - `v2` will be `i + 1`.
   - The output will be: `? i+1 i+1 i+1 i+1`.

2. **If `r` does not equal `<`:**
   - `v1` will be 0.
   - `v2` will be `i + 1`.
   - The output will be: `? 0 0 i+1 i+1`.

### Final Answer:
Since the exact value of `r` is not specified, we need to account for both possibilities. However, we can provide a precise description based on the conditions.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is i+1 if r equals '<', otherwise 0, and v2 is i+1)**
