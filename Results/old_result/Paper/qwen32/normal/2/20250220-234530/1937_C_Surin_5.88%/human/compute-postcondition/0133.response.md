The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `r`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string.**
