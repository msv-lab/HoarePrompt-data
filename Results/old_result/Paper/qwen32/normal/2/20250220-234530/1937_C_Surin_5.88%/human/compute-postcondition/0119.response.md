The code snippet assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v1` was `i` and `v2` was `i + 1`. After executing the code, `v1` will now hold the value `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
