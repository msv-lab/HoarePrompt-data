To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop evolves over its entire run from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it prints a query and reads an input `r`.
- If `r` is `'>'`, it updates `prev` to the current `i`.
- `v1` and `v2` do not change within the loop based on the provided code snippet.
- `g` remains 0 throughout the loop.

### Final State:
After the loop completes all iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`), the following will be true:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.
- `g` remains 0 as it is never modified.
- `v1` remains the highest value of `i` for which `r` was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2` remains `n-1` as it is never modified.
- `prev` will be the highest value of `i` for which `r` was `'>'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.

### Output State:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, n is greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is the highest value of i for which r was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, v2 is n-1, prev is the highest value of i for which r was '>', or 0 if no such i exists.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop finishes executing all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the variable `t` retains its initial value, and `n` remains unchanged as it defines the loop's range. The variable `g` stays at 0 since it is never modified. The variable `v1` holds the highest index `i` where the response `r` was `'<'`, or it remains 0 if no such index exists. Similarly, `v2` remains `n-1` as it is not altered. Finally, `prev` stores the highest index `i` where the response `r` was `'>'`, or it stays 0 if no such index exists.
