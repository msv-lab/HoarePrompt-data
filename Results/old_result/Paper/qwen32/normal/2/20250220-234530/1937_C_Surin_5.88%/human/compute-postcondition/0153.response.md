Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, and a sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` which is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given permutation.**
