The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `i`
- `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`
- `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `kp` is `n-1`
- `r` is the input string

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has reached some value, and since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `x + 1`** 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1** 

But to match the format exactly, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration `i` is `x + 1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can say `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

So, the final answer would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1** 

For clarity and to fit the format:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`** 

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can simply say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1** 

But to match the format exactly with a variable:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is equal to '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**
