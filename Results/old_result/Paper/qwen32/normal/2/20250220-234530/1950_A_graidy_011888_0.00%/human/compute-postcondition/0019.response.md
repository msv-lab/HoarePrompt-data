Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (though this does not affect the specific print statement we're examining).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- The value of `res` depends on the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`, but it is not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are all random integers between 1 and 9.
- The `sep=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the values should be separated by a space.

### Output:
Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, the exact values cannot be determined without running the code. However, we know the format and range of the values.

Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
