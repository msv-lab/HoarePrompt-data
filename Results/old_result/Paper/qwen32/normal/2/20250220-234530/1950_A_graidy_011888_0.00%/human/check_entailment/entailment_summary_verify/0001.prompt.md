You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9. For each set, it determines and prints whether the sequence forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on specific conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The program generates random numbers for `x`, `y`, and `z` within the range [1, 9] and checks if they form a "stair" or "peak". However, the problem specifies that the input values `a`, `b`, and `c` can be any digit from 0 to 9, not just 1 to 9.
   
2. The program does not read input from the user or any external source. Instead, it generates random numbers, which means it does not process the actual test cases provided in the input format.

3. The program outputs the generated numbers along with the result, which is not required by the problem statement. The problem asks for specific output ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") without any additional information.

4. The program runs a fixed number of iterations (1000), regardless of the number of test cases provided in the input. This is incorrect because the number of test cases (`t`) is specified in the input and should determine how many times the program processes input.

5. The program uses lowercase strings ('peak', 'stair', 'none') for the results, whereas the problem requires uppercase strings ('PEAK', 'STAIR', 'NONE').

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
