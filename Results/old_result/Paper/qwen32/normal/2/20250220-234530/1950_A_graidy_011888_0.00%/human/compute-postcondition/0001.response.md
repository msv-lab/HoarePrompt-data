In this case, the `while` loop condition is `i <= 1000`. The variable `i` is already initialized to 1 right before the loop starts. Since `i` (which is 1) is indeed less than or equal to 1000, the loop can certainly execute at least once without any modifications to the state.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1**
