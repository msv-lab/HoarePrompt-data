Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 2; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is 'peak'.**

Explanation: The value of `res` has been updated to the string 'peak', while all other variables retain their initial values.
