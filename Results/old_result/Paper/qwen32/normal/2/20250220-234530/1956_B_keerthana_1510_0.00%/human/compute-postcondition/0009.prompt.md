Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of cards each player receives. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    elements = line.split()
    print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `line` is "1 2 3"; `elements` is ['1', '2', '3']

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `line` is the fifth line of the input, `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `line` is the seventh line of the input, `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the seventh line by whitespace.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
