The code snippet `elements = line.split()` updates the `elements` variable by splitting the string stored in `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Given that `line` is the fifth line of the input, the exact contents of `line` are not specified, so we cannot determine the specific elements of the resulting list. However, we know that `elements` will now hold the list produced by splitting `line`.

Output State: **`line` is the fifth line of the input, `elements` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `line`**.
