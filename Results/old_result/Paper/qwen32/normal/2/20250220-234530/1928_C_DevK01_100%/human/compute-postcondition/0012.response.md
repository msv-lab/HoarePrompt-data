The code snippet appends the result of the integer division `q // i` to the list `M`. 

Given the initial state, `M` is not mentioned, so we assume `M` is initially an empty list. After executing the code, `M` will contain one additional element, which is the result of `q // i`.

No other variables (`q`, `w`, `i`) are modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is an integer that satisfies `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`, and `w` must be greater than 1; `i` is 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`; `q % i == 0`. Additionally, `q // i >= x - 1` is true, meaning the integer division of `q` by `i` is at least `x - 1`; `M` is a list containing the integer `q // i`.**
