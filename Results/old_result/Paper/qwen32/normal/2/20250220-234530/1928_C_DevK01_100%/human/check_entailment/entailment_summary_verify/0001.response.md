To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure that it aligns with the problem description and the function summaries. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that, given Vasya's position \( n \) in the line and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process, the conditions of the settling process are satisfied. Specifically:
- The sequence of numbers repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
- The sequence starts with \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), then decreases back to \( 2 \), and then starts again.
- We need to find all possible \( k \) values that satisfy the condition for a given \( n \) and \( x \).

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid \( k \) values.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, \( n \) (Vasya's position) and \( x \) (number Vasya received) are read.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if \( (n + x) \) is odd. If it is, it immediately prints `0` because the sequence length must be even for valid \( k \) values.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of \( (y - 2) // 2 \) where \( y = n + x \). These divisors represent potential \( k \) values.
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), another set of potential \( k \) values is found using `func_1` with \( (n - x) // 2 \).
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - The length of the resulting set is printed as the number of valid \( k \) values.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and includes it in the result if it meets the criteria.
   - It also iterates through numbers from \( 1 \) to the square root of \( q \) to find other divisors.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary provided for `func_1` is slightly misleading. The function does not accept a list of tuples but rather a single integer \( q \) and an integer \( x \). It returns a list of divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the logic:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The check for \( (n + x) \% 2 != 0 \) is correct. If the sum is odd, there cannot be a valid repeating sequence of length \( 2k - 2 \).

2. **Finding Divisors:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). This is crucial for determining the possible \( k \) values.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The program combines results from two sets of divisors and removes duplicates. This ensures that all valid \( k \) values are counted without repetition.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like \( n = 3 \) and \( x = 1 \) correctly by ensuring that \( k > 1 \).

### Verification Against Examples
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: \( n = 10 \), \( x = 2 \)
   - Expected Output: \( 4 \)
   - Calculation: Valid \( k \) values are \( 2, 3, 5, 6 \).

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: \( 1 \)
   - Calculation: Valid \( k \) value is \( 2 \).

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: \( n = 76 \), \( x = 4 \)
   - Expected Output: \( 9 \)
   - Calculation: Valid \( k \) values are \( 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \).

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: \( n = 100 \), \( x = 99 \)
   - Expected Output: \( 0 \)
   - Calculation: No valid \( k \) values.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 500000000 \)
   - Expected Output: \( 1 \)
   - Calculation: Valid \( k \) value is \( 500000001 \).
