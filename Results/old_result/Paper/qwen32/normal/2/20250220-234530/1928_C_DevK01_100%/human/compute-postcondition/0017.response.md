The code snippet provided appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 2. Therefore, the list `M` will have `2` appended to it. The values of `q`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `M` now includes the value 2.**
