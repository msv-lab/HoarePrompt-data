The provided code attempts to execute `w = math.sqrt(q)`, where `q` is a list of tuples. However, the `math.sqrt()` function expects a single numeric argument, not a list of tuples. This would result in a TypeError.

Given the context and the task requirements, we'll assume the intention was to apply the square root operation to a numeric value within the tuples, but since no specific operation is defined, and the code as written will fail, we will reflect the state as accurately as possible.

Since the code fails due to the incorrect usage of `math.sqrt()`, no new variables are assigned, and the existing variables (`q` and `M`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list.**
