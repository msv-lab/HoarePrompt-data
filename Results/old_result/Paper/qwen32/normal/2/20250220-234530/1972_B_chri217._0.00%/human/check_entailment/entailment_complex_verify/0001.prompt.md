You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, where 'U' represents a coin facing up and 'D' represents a coin facing down. The length of s is a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if (num_up % 2 == 1) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string `s` consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing coins facing up and down respectively. It returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
- We have a circular arrangement of coins.
- Each coin can be either facing up ('U') or down ('D').
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its two adjacent coins.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Observations:
- The game revolves around the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of facing-up coins.
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.

### Explanation of the Solution:
- The solution reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins and their initial arrangement.
- It counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`).
- It checks the parity of `num_up`:
  - If `num_up` is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
  - If `num_up` is even, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

### Code Review:
- The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The function `func_1` accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
- The logic aligns with the key observations made above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
