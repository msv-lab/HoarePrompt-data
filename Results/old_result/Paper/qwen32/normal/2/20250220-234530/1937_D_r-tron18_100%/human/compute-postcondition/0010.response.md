To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Given:
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 0.
- `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`. However, this last condition seems contradictory since `ol` is equal to `totalOne` and `zr` is 0, implying `totalOne <= 0`. Given that `totalOne` represents the count of '>' characters, it should be at least 1 unless `s1` contains no '>', which contradicts the condition that `el` is '>'. Therefore, we assume there is a mistake in the problem statement regarding `ol <= zr`.

The line of code:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```
implies that `zeroInd` is being assigned a value that is twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Since `suffZero` is `[0]` and `ol` is `totalOne`, the exact value of `zeroInd` depends on what `func_1` does. Without knowing the definition of `func_1`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we can express `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1([0], totalOne)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0], totalOne)`**.
