The code snippet provided assigns values to `ol` and `zr` based on the current values of `totalOne` and `suffZero`.

- `ol` is set to the value of `totalOne`.
- `zr` is set to the length of `suffZero` minus 1.

Since `suffZero` is either `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`, the length of `suffZero` will be either 1 or 2. Therefore, `zr` will be either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
