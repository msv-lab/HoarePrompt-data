arr is a list of strings where each string consists of characters '<' and '>', and times is a list of integers representing the lengths of the corresponding strings in arr, such that len(arr) equals the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), and for each test case, 1 ≤ times[i] ≤ 5 · 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all elements in times does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
