Given the provided code snippet and the initial state, let's determine the output state:

The code snippet modifies the value of `ans[i]` using the formula:
```
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
```

Let's break down the components involved in this calculation:

- `zeroInd` is defined as `0` if `suffZero` is `[0]`, or `2 * (i + 1)` if `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`.
- `oneInd` is defined as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- `fi` is defined as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

Since the exact definitions of `func_1` and the values of `preOne`, `zr`, and `i` are not provided, we will express `ans[i]` in terms of these variables.

The only variable that changes based on the given code snippet is `ans[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values unless explicitly modified elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `0` if `suffZero` is `[0]`, or `2 * (i + 1)` if `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
