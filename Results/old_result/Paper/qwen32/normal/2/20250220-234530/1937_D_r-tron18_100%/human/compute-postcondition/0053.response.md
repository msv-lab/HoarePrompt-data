Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not).
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not).
- `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables.
- `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 1.
- `zeroInd` is 1.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>'.
- `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- Other variables remain unchanged.

Calculating the New Value:
- `ans[0]` is set to `1 - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n + 1`.
- This simplifies to `ans[0] = 2 - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `2 - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n`; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 1; `zeroInd` is 1; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`.**
