The code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. Given that `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, the length of `suffZero` is 2, so `zr` becomes `2 - 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1.**
