The given code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` based on several variables and their relationships. Here's the updated state:

```
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
```

Given the initial state, let's update `ans[i]`:

- `zeroInd` is either `0` or `2 * (i + 1)`.
- `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)` if `zr` is `0`, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 2)`.
- `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `ans[i]` is initially `0` and will be updated to the new calculated value.

The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the calculation of `ans[i]`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`; `zeroInd` is `0` or `2 * (i + 1)`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)` if `zr` is `0`, otherwise `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 2)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
