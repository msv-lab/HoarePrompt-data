To determine the output state, we need to focus on the calculation of `zeroInd`. The value of `zeroInd` is calculated using the function `func_1`, which is not defined in the given context. However, we can still express the output state in terms of the function calls.

Given:
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.
- `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 1, and `zr` is greater than `ol`.

The line of code calculates `zeroInd` as follows:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we can express it in terms of the function calls.

The output state will include the updated value of `zeroInd` and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.
