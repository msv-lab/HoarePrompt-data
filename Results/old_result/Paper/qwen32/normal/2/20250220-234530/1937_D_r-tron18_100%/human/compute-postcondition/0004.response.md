The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, or `suffZero`. The only change is the creation of the new list `ans`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the string `s1` such that `n = len(s1)`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
