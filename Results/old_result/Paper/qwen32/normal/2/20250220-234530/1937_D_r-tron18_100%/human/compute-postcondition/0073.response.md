The given code snippet appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. The new value is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`.

Given the initial state, `suffZero` is either `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`. After executing the line `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)`, the `suffZero` list will have an additional element.

If `suffZero` was initially `[0]`, after the operation, `suffZero` becomes `[0, i + 1]`.

If `suffZero` was initially `[0, i + 1]`, after the operation, `suffZero` becomes `[0, i + 1, (i + 1) + (i + 1)]` which simplifies to `[0, i + 1, 2 * (i + 1)]`.

Since `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, the exact value of `i` is not specified, but the pattern of appending `i + 1` to the last element of `suffZero` holds true.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is updated to include the new value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
