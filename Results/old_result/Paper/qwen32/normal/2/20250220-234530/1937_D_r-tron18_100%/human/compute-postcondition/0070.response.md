Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `ol <= zr`, or `0` if `suffZero` is `[0]`, or `2 * (i + 1)` if `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr`, or `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
