Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0. If `ol <= zr`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `2 * func_1([0], totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `pre[0] - k`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**
