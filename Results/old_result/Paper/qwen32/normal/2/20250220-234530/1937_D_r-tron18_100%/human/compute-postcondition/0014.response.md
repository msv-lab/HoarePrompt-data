The code snippet assigns the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Given that `suffZero` is initially `[0]`, `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element of `suffZero`, which is `0`. Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * 0`, resulting in `0`.

None of the other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, and `ol` is greater than `zr`; `zeroInd` is 0.**
