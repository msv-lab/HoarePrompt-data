To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables:

The line of code provided is:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
```

This line updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the current values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `1`. 

Hereâ€™s what we know about these variables from the initial state:
- `zeroInd` is defined as `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- `oneInd` is defined as `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.

Since the code only modifies `ans[i]` and does not affect any other variables, we can directly compute the new value of `ans[i]` using the given formula.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans[i]` will be:
```python
ans[i] = (suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]) - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n + 1
```

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is updated to include the new value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `(suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]) - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n + 1`; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
