You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` composed of '<' and '>' characters, calculating and returning a list of integers `ans` where each element corresponds to a computed value based on the positions of '<' and '>' in the string.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it against the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown

The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the cell's character, and the character is inverted after the pinball moves. The goal is to determine how long it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze them:

#### Function 1: `func_1(arr, times)`
This function calculates a difference between elements in the array `arr` based on the index determined by `times`. Specifically, it returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `-1 - times` (or the start of the array if this index is out of bounds).

#### Function 2: `func_2(s1, n)`
This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre`: A list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne`: The count of '>' characters.
   - `preOne`: An accumulated list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `suffZero`: A list initialized with 0, used to store cumulative sums related to '<' characters.
   - `ans`: A list to store the result for each starting position.

2. **Loop through the grid in reverse**:
   - For each cell, if the character is '>', it calculates the time to leave the grid using the `preOne` list and the `suffZero` list.
   - If the character is '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time similarly.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The calculations involve complex indexing and accumulation to determine the time based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters.

### Correctness Evaluation

While the code appears to implement a sophisticated approach using prefix and suffix accumulations, the logic is not straightforward and requires careful verification against the problem constraints and examples.

#### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
3
>><
4
<<<<
6
<><<<>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

Running the provided code with this input should produce the expected output. However, without a detailed proof of the correctness of the accumulation and indexing logic, it's challenging to definitively state that the program is correct for all possible inputs.

Given the complexity and the absence of a clear explanation of why the accumulation and indexing work as intended, it's reasonable to assume that while the program may work for some cases, it might not be universally correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program's logic is intricate and relies heavily on specific patterns and assumptions about the distribution of '<' and '>' characters. Without a rigorous mathematical proof or additional test cases, we cannot conclusively state its correctness for all scenarios.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
