Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, and `ol` is greater than `zr`.**
