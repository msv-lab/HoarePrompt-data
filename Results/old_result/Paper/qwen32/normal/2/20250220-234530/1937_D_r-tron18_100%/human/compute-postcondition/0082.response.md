Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', `ans[i]` is `(suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]) - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Here, `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
