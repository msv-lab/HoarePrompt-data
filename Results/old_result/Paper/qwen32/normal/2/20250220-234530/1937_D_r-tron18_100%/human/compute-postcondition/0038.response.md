To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the given line of code on the variables. Here's the breakdown:

Given Code:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

We need to understand what `func_1(suffZero, ol)` returns. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we'll assume it processes `suffZero` and `ol` in a way that results in a specific value.

Let's consider the possible values for `suffZero` and `ol`:
- `suffZero` can be `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.

The value of `zeroInd` will be twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `suffZero` is `[0]`:**
   - `func_1([0], ol)` could return a value based on `ol`. Let's denote this value as `v1`.
   - `zeroInd` would then be `2 * v1`.

2. **If `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`:**
   - `func_1([0, i + 1], ol)` could return a different value based on `ol`. Let's denote this value as `v2`.
   - `zeroInd` would then be `2 * v2`.

Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot compute exact numerical values for `v1` and `v2`. However, we can express `zeroInd` in terms of these values.

### Output State:
Given the above scenarios, the output state will be:

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.

This output state reflects the updated value of `zeroInd` based on the function `func_1` and the unchanged values of other variables.
