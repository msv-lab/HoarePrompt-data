The given code snippet assigns a new value to `oneInd`. The value assigned is `2 * preOne[-1]`.

From the initial state, we know that `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning. Since `preOne` is defined this way, `preOne[-1]` represents the last element of `preOne`, which is the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`.

Therefore, `oneInd` is now `2 * preOne[-1]`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**.
