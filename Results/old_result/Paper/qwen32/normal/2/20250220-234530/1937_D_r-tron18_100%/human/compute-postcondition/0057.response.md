Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `2 - (2 * func_1(preOne, zr)) + n` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[0]` is `-1 - 2 * preOne[-1]` if `totalOne` is 1; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 1; `zeroInd` is 1 if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `-1` if `ol` is 1; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `2 * preOne[-1]`; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`.**
