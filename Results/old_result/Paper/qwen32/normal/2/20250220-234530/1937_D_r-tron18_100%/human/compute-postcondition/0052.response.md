To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given line of code within the context of the initial state provided:

```
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

Given:
- `oneInd` is initially undefined in the provided initial state, but it will be set by this line of code.
- `func_1` is a function whose definition is not provided, so we will assume it returns a specific value based on its arguments `preOne` and `zr`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.
- `zr` is 1.

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `oneInd`. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of the function's output.

Let's denote the output of `func_1(preOne, zr)` as `result`. Therefore, `oneInd` will be `2 * result`.

Thus, the updated output state will include the new value of `oneInd` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables, `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is 1, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`**.
