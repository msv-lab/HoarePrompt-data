To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Code:
```python
oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
```

This line updates the value of `oneInd` by calling `func_1` twice with different arguments and summing the results. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we will assume that `func_1` returns some value based on the inputs `preOne` and `zr`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `oneInd` is updated based on the result of `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `oneInd`. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of the function calls.

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`; `zeroInd` is `0` or `2 * (i + 1)` based on `suffZero`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`; `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`.**
