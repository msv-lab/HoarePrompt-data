Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`; `a` is `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000]`; `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` joined by spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
