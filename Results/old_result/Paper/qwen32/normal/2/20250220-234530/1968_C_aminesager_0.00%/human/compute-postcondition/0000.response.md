`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n` and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
