The code snippet provided updates the `result` variable by joining the elements of list `a` into a space-separated string. The list `a` already contains `n` elements where each element is derived from the last element of the original `a` plus the corresponding element in `T` (in reverse order). 

Since the list `a` is already defined according to the initial state, the only change is that `result` is now a string representation of these elements, separated by spaces.

Output State: **`a` contains `n` elements starting with the last element of the original `a` and each subsequent element is the previous element plus the corresponding element in `T` (in reverse order); `result` is a space-separated string of these elements.**
