You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It computes a new list based on these inputs and prints the list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct an array `a` such that:
- `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
- `x_i = a_i % a_(i-1)` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

Given an array `x` with `n-1` elements, we need to find an array `a` with `n` elements that satisfies these conditions.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array `n`.
   - It reads the array `x` with `n-1` elements.
   - It initializes `a` with `[1000]`.
   - It constructs the rest of the array `a` by iterating from `1` to `n-1` and setting `a[i] = a[i-1] - x[i-1]`.
   - It reverses the array `a` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The initial value of `a` is set to `[1000]`. This is arbitrary and may not satisfy the condition `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`.
2. **Construction Logic**: The logic used to construct the array `a` (`a[i] = a[i-1] - x[i-1]`) does not guarantee that the resulting array will satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_(i-1)`.
3. **Reversal**: Reversing the array at the end does not change the fact that the construction logic is flawed.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify with the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `4`, `2 4 1`
- Expected Output: An array `a` such that:
  - `a[2] % a[1] = 2`
  - `a[3] % a[2] = 4`
  - `a[4] % a[3] = 1`

If we follow the program's logic:
- Initialize `a` as `[1000]`.
- Compute subsequent elements: `a[1] = 1000 - 2 = 998`, `a[2] = 998 - 4 = 994`, `a[3] = 994 - 1 = 993`.
- Reverse the array: `[993, 994, 998, 1000]`.

This does not satisfy the required conditions:
- `994 % 993 != 2`
- `998 % 994 != 4`
- `1000 % 998 != 1`

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for constructing the array `a` is flawed and does not ensure that the conditions are met.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
