To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the state based on the given conditions and outputs after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `t > 0`.
2. **Loop Body**:
   - `t` is decremented by 1.
   - `n` is read as an integer.
   - `line` is read as a string and split into a list of integers `T`.
   - A list `a` is initialized with `[1000]`.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the next element of `a` is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
   - The list `a` is then reversed.
   - The reversed list `a` is converted to a space-separated string `result` and printed.

### Observations from Given Outputs:
- After the first iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, and `a` is constructed based on the input `T`.
- After the second iteration, `t` is further decremented, and the same process is repeated.
- After the third iteration, `t` becomes 0, indicating the end of the loop.

### Final Output State:
Since `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `t` reaches 0, the final state will be when `t` is 0. The values of `n`, `T`, and `a` will depend on the inputs provided during the last iteration.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be when `t` is 0, and the last `result` (which is the space-separated string of the final `a` list) will be printed. The state of `n`, `T`, and `a` will reflect the values from the last iteration.

**Output State:** **t is 0; n is the last input integer; T is the list of integers derived from the last input string; a is the list constructed and reversed in the last iteration; result is the space-separated string of the final a list.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the last computed `result` (which is the final `a` list converted to a space-separated string) will be printed.
