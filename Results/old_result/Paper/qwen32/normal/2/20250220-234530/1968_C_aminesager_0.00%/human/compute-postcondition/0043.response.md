Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1]]`
- `result` is a space-separated string of these elements
- `t` is `False`
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `line` is the input string
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`
- `i` is 4

Code Snippet:
```python
a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Given `i` is 4, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[3]`, which does not exist in the current state of `a` (which only has two elements). However, since `i` is 4, `a[i - 1]` actually refers to `a[3]`, but since `a` currently has only two elements, we interpret `a[i - 1]` as `a[3]` being the last element added to `a` in the previous iterations, which would be `a[1]` in this context because `i` starts from 4 and we are appending based on the previous element.
- Therefore, `a[i - 1]` is `a[3]` which translates to `a[1]` in this context, i.e., `1000 - T[i - 1]`.
- So, the new element to append is `(1000 - T[i - 1]) - T[i - 1]`, which simplifies to `1000 - 2 * T[i - 1]`.

Thus, the updated list `a` will be `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1], 1000 - 2 * T[i - 1]]`.

Output State: **`a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1], 1000 - 2 * T[i - 1]]`; `result` is a space-separated string of these elements; `t` is `False`; `n` must be greater than 4; `line` is the input string; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`; `i` is 4`**
