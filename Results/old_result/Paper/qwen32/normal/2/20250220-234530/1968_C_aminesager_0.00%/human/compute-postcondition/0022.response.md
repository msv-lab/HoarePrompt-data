Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`; `a` is `[1000]`; `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` joined by spaces; `line` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that the list `a` is reassigned to contain only one element, which is the integer `1000`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
