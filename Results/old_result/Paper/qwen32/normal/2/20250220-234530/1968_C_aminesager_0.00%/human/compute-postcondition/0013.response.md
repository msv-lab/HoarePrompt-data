To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the list `a`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, it appends a new value to the list `a` based on the previous value and the corresponding element in the list `T`.

Here's the breakdown:

- Initially, `a` is `[1000]`.
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1]]`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]]`.

Following this pattern, after `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, with each subsequent element being the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in `a`.

Thus, after the loop completes all `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will be:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], \ldots, (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - \ldots - T[n-2])] \]

The final element in `a` will be:
\[ a[n-1] = 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]) \]

So, the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`, `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])]`**

In simpler terms, the list `a` will have `n` elements where each element is computed by subtracting the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to that point from 1000.
