To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `a` based on the input list `T`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, appending to `a` the result of subtracting `T[i-1]` from the last element of `a`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` starts as `[1000]`.
   - `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the loop appends `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to `a`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `n-1` iterations, `a` will contain `n` elements.
   - The first element of `a` is `1000`.
   - Each subsequent element `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.

Thus, the final state of `a` can be described as:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], \ldots, (\text{previous element}) - T[n-2]] \]

The final `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces.

**Output State: **`a` contains `n` elements starting with `1000` and each subsequent element is the previous element minus the corresponding element in `T`. The `result` is a space-separated string of these elements.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `a` will have `n` elements where each element is computed by iteratively subtracting the values from `T` from the initial value `1000`. The `result` will be a string representation of this list `a` with elements separated by spaces.
