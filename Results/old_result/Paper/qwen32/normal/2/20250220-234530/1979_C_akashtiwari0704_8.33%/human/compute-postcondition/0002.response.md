The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `bets`. This means `bets` now holds an integer value obtained from user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `bets` is an input integer.**
