To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the variable `ans`. The loop iterates over the range of `bets`, and in each iteration, it appends the string representation of the `i-th` element of the list `a` (after it has been updated) followed by a space to the string `ans`.

Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = bets - 1`, after all iterations, `ans` will contain the string representations of the first `bets` elements of the list `a` (after they have been updated), each followed by a space.

Let's summarize the final state of the variables involved:

- `t`, `n`, `k`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, and `sumo` remain unchanged as per the problem statement and the nature of the loop.
- `ans` will be a string containing the string representations of the first `bets` elements of the list `a` (after they have been updated), each followed by a space.

Given that the loop runs `bets` times, the final value of `ans` will be the concatenation of these string representations with spaces in between.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **the string representation of the first `bets` elements of the list `a` (after they have been updated), each followed by a space.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a string with the updated values of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, each separated by a space.
