Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.
- `k` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `k_i` is between 2 and 20 inclusive.
- `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list whose first `bets` elements are updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`.
- `prod` is the product of the original first `bets` elements of the list `a`.
- `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of `a` and is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `prod`.

The provided Python code snippet contains only one statement:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement outputs the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, or `sumo`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that would change the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
