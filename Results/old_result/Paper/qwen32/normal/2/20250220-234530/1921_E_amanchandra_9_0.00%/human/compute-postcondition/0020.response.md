The value of `l` is assigned the maximum between 1 and `yb - x`. Given that `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, the value of `l` depends on the comparison between `yb - x` and 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`**.
