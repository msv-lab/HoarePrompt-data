Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible scenarios. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initial Check (`xa > xb`)**:
   - The condition `if xa > xb: print('Draw')` is incorrect. This condition checks if Alice's row position is greater than Bob's row position, but it doesn't necessarily mean the game will end in a draw. For example, if Alice is below Bob but still has enough moves to reach Bob, she could potentially win.

2. **Handling Odd and Even Differences (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`)**:
   - The logic for handling odd and even differences between `xa` and `xb` is flawed. Specifically, the ranges `l` and `r` are calculated incorrectly and the conditions for determining the winner are not properly checked.

3. **Range Calculation (`l` and `r`)**:
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` should consider the movement capabilities of both players and the board boundaries more accurately. The current implementation does not correctly account for the possible moves and their implications on the game's outcome.

4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - The conditions for determining whether Alice or Bob can win are not correctly implemented. The program does not properly simulate the optimal moves of both players and check if one can force a win.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the relative positions of Alice and Bob and simulate their optimal moves. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves Alice needs to reach Bob's row
        alice_moves = h - xa
        bob_moves = xb - 1
        
        # If Alice can reach Bob's row before Bob can reach Alice's row, Alice wins
        if alice_moves < bob_moves:
            print("Alice")
        elif alice_moves > bob_moves:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            # If they can reach each other's row in the same number of moves, check column positions
            if abs(ya - yb) <= alice_moves:
                print("Alice")
            elif abs(ya - yb) <= bob_moves:
                print("Bob")
            else:
                print("Draw")

func()
```

This corrected version properly considers the number of moves each player can make and determines the winner based on their relative positions and movement capabilities.
