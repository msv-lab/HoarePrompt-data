Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a grid's height (`h`) and width (`w`), and the coordinates of two points (`(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`). For each test case, it determines and prints the winner between Alice and Bob based on their positions and the grid dimensions, or declares a draw.**
