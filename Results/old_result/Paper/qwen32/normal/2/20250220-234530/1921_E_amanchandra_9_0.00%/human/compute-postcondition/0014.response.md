Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the loop counter starting from 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`. Otherwise, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.**
