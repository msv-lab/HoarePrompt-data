The code assigns the value of `min(w, yb + x)` to the variable `r`. Given the initial state, the values of `w`, `yb`, and `x` remain unchanged, but `r` is now defined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the loop counter starting from 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, and `abs(xa - xb)` is even, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.
