The provided code snippet reads six integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The loop counter `i` and the integer `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is the loop counter starting from 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input.**
