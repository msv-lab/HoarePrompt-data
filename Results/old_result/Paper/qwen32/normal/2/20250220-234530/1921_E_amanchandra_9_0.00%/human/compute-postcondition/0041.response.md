Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` (coordinates of two points). It returns a result for each test case based on the given coordinates and dimensions. Specifically, if `x_a` is not equal to `x_b` or `y_a` is not equal to `y_b`, it performs some computation (implied by the problem context) and returns a result. If `x_a` equals `x_b` and `y_a` equals `y_b`, it implies an invalid scenario as per the constraints, but the exact handling of this case is not specified in the given output description.**
