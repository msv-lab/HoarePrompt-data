The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`) described in the initial state. The condition that `xa` is greater than `xb` does not influence the execution of this particular `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
