The code appends a new element to the list `li`. This new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6.
- `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
- `li` is a list containing `2*n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last element is `a + (k+1)*c + d*h`.
- `k` is `k + 1`.
- `h` is `h + 1`.

After executing the line `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)`, the list `li` now contains `2*n + 2` elements. The new element appended is `a + k * c + d * h`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `2*n + 2` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, the next `n` elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the last two elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*h` and `a + k * c + d * h`, `k` is `k + 1`, `h` is `h + 1`.**
