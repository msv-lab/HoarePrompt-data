Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters is greater than the number of "D" characters only when `n` is odd. If so, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".**
