In this task, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `results`. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `results` one by one. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses.

Given:
- `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` must be greater than 0, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.
- The loop variable `i` represents the current element being processed in the list `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` held the value of the last processed element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `results` that hasn't been processed yet. However, since the loop variable `i` is reassigned to the next element in the list automatically, we don't need to adjust `i` directly. Instead, we need to ensure that there is indeed a next element in `results`.

Since the loop iterates over all elements in `results`, the only way for the loop to execute one more time is if there are still elements left in `results` to process. Therefore, the state of `results` should remain the same, but conceptually, we are moving to the next element.

State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where `t` must be greater than 0, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**

Note: The specific value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the exact position in the list, but we know it will be the next element in the list during the next iteration.
