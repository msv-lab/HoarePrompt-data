The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold whatever string is provided as input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `arr` is the string provided as input.**
