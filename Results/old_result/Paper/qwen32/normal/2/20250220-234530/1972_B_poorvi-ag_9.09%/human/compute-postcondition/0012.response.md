Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer and is odd, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the string provided as input, and `results` is a list containing either ['yes'] if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, or ['no'] if `arr` has fewer or equal 'U' characters compared to 'D' characters.**
