Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer and is odd, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `arr` is the string provided as input, and `arr` contains more 'U' characters than 'D' characters.**

In simple terms, the `results` list now contains the string 'yes', while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
