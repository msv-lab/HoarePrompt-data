You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters is greater than the number of "D" characters only when `n` is odd. If so, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The game involves a circular arrangement of coins where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The objective is to determine if Alice (who starts first) can win given the initial configuration of the coins.

### Key Observations:

1. **Even Number of Coins**: If the number of coins `n` is even, Alice will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because each turn reduces the number of coins by one, and since `n` is even, the last coin will be left for Bob to pick, making Alice the loser.
   
2. **Odd Number of Coins**: If `n` is odd, the game dynamics change. Here, Alice has an advantage if she can force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of coins. However, the problem simplifies further if we consider the count of 'U' (facing-up) coins:
   - If the number of 'U' coins is greater than the number of 'D' (facing-down) coins, Alice can potentially force a win by always picking strategically.
   - Otherwise, Bob can force a win.

### Provided Solution Analysis:

The provided solution uses the following logic:
- For each test case, it checks if the number of coins `n` is even. If so, it appends 'no' to the results list (indicating Bob wins).
- If `n` is odd, it compares the counts of 'U' and 'D'. If the count of 'U' is greater, it appends 'yes' (Alice wins); otherwise, it appends 'no'.

### Issues with the Provided Solution:

While the solution correctly handles the case when `n` is even, the logic for the odd case is flawed. The count of 'U' versus 'D' does not directly determine the winner when `n` is odd. Instead, the parity of `n` alone should be sufficient to determine the winner when `n` is odd, assuming optimal play.

### Correct Approach:

- If `n` is even, Alice will always lose.
- If `n` is odd, Alice can always win by playing optimally.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution incorrectly uses the count of 'U' and 'D' when `n` is odd, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to solely rely on the parity of `n`.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.
