To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. The output states given indicate that the loop has executed a certain number of times based on the length of the `results` list.

From the given output states:
- After 1 iteration, `results` must have a length greater than 0.
- After 2 iterations, `results` must still have a length greater than 0.
- After 3 iterations, `results` must have a length greater than 1.

This pattern suggests that the loop will continue to iterate as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is the length of the `results` list.

Since the loop simply prints each element of the `results` list, the final output state will be that all elements of the `results` list have been printed. The state of the `results` list itself does not change; it remains the same list of `'yes'` and `'no'` values.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is that all elements of the `results` list have been printed, and the `results` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **all elements of the `results` list have been printed, and `results` remains unchanged.**
