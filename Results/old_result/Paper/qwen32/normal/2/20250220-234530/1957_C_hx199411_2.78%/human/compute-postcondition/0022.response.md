To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variable `num` changes based on the values of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations. The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
   - `num` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each of the `k` iterations, the loop reads two integers `c` and `r`.
   - If `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` was equal to `r` in each iteration.
   - Specifically, if there are `x` iterations where `c` equals `r`, and `y` iterations where `c` does not equal `r`, then `x + y = k` and `num = x * 1 + y * 2`.

Therefore, the final value of `num` is determined by the counts of `c == r` and `c != r` across all `k` iterations.

**Output State**: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c` equals `r` and 2 for each iteration where `c` does not equal `r` after `k` iterations.**

In simpler terms, `num` is the total increment accumulated over `k` iterations based on the equality of `c` and `r`.
