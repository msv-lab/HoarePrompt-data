The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` have certain values or conditions, but these are not affected by the current line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` must be greater than 0; `num` is 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.**
