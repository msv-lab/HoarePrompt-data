The given code snippet sets `num` to 0. This change affects the variable `num` directly. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5, `i` is 6.**
