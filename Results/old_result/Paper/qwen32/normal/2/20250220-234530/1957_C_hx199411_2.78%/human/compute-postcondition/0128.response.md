To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variables evolve as the loop runs through all `t` test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Head (`while t:`)**:
   - Initially, `t` is the number of test cases.
   - In each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 until it reaches 0.

2. **Inside the Loop**:
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read.
   - `num` is initialized to 0 and incremented based on the moves (`r_i`, `c_i`).
     - If `r_i == c_i`, `num` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
   - Depending on the value of `m`:
     - If `m == 0`, the output is `0`.
     - If `m == 1`, the output is `1`.
     - If `m > 1`, a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is used to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all `t` test cases have been processed, `t` will be 0.
   - The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` will reflect the last test case processed.
   - The output for each test case will have been printed.

Given the above, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

- `t` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed.
- `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` will reflect the values from the last test case.
- The `dp` array will reflect the computation for the last test case if `m > 1`.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, we focus on the final value of `t` and the state of the variables from the last test case.

Output State: **t is 0; n, k, num, and m reflect the values from the last test case; dp reflects the computation for the last test case if m > 1.**

In simpler terms, the loop will have finished processing all test cases, and `t` will be 0. The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` will hold the values from the last test case, and if applicable, the `dp` array will contain the results of the DP computation for that last test case.
