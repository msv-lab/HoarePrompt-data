The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is increased by 2.**
