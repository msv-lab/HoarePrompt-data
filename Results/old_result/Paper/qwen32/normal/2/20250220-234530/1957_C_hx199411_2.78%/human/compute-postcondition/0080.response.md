To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

Given:
- The loop runs as `for i in range(3, m + 1):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5.

The variable `m` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same. From the problem statement, we know that `m` must be at least 4, and it is calculated as `m = n - num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` being incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer such that `n - num >= 3`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, and `dp[4]` set to 25, `i` is 5**
