The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 previously)
- `k` is greater than 0
- `c` is the first integer from the input
- `r` is the second integer from the input

After executing `num += 1`, the value of `num` increases by 1. Since the initial value of `num` is not specified, we can only say that it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `num + 1`.**
