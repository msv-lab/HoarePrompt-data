The given code snippet reads two integers from the input, which represent `n` and `k`. After executing the code, `n` will hold the first integer read, and `k` will hold the second integer read. The values of `t`, `r_i`, and `c_i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.**
