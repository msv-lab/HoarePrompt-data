The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is greater than 0
- `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input
- `i` is incremented by 1
- If `c` initially equaled `r`, `num` is set to 2, otherwise `num` is set to 3
- If `c` did not initially equal `r`, `c` and `r` are updated to the new input values

We only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1); If `c` initially equaled `r`, `num` is set to 2, otherwise `num` is set to 3; If `c` did not initially equal `r`, `c` and `r` are updated to the new input values.**

To make it clear, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. 

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; If `c` initially equaled `r`, `num` is set to 2, otherwise `num` is set to 3; If `c` did not initially equal `r`, `c` and `r` are updated to the new input values.**

Since we are only adjusting `i` in the loop head, the final simplified state is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1;**
