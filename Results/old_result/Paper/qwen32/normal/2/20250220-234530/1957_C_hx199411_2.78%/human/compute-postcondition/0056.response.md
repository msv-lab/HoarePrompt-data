The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This means the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the new input.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `num` is recalculated as 1 if the new `c` equals the new `r`, otherwise `num` is 2.
- `m` is recalculated as `n - num`.
- `c` and `r` are now the new integers read from the input.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**
