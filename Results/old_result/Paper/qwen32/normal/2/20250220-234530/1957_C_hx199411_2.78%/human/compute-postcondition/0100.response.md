Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `num` has been incremented by 2. If `c` equals `r`, `num` was initially 1 and is now 3. Otherwise, `num` was initially 2 and is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
