Postcondition: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is the integer read from the input, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `leaves` is a `deque` containing all nodes that have exactly one neighbor, and `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If `moves` is not empty, then `moves` contains some value(s). Otherwise, `moves` is falsy.**
