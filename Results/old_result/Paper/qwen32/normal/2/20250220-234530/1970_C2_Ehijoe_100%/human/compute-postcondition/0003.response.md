The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` changes the type of the `nodes` variable from a regular dictionary to a `defaultdict` where the default value for new keys is an empty list. This does not affect the values of `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, or `empty`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`.**
