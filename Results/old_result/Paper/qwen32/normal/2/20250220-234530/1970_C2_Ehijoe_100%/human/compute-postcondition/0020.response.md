The code snippet `leaves.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the `deque` named `leaves`. Since the initial state specifies that `leaves` is a `deque` and `key` is a key from the `defaultdict` `nodes`, after executing this line, `leaves` will contain the `key` as its last element.

The other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `leaves` is a `deque` containing the `key`.**
