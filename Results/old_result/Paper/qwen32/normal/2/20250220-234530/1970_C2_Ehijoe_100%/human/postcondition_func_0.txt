The function `func_1` determines whether there is a cycle in a graph represented by the `nodes` dictionary starting from the `start` node, excluding the path coming from the `parent` node. It returns `False` if the current node has only one neighbor which is the parent, indicating a dead end or a leaf node. Otherwise, it recursively checks each neighbor and returns `True` if any recursive call indicates the presence of a cycle.
