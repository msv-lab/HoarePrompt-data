Postcondition: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, and `leaves` is a `deque`. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, then `leaves` contains `new_key`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged. `key` is `new_key`.**
