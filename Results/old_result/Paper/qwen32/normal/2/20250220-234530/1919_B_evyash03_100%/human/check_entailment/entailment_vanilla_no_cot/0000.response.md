Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns its absolute value, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

To solve this problem optimally, one should consider dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal way to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. The given solution does not implement any such logic and thus is incorrect.
