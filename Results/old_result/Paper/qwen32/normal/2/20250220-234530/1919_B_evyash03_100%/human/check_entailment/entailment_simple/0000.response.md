### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The program defines a function `func_1` which takes a string `expression` and its `length`. It counts the number of `'+'` characters in the string and calculates the number of `'-'` characters as `sub = length - count`. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`.

However, this approach does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The provided function simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`, which does not account for the optimal splitting strategy required to minimize the total penalty.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the third test case from the example:
- Input: `+-+-+-`
- Expected Output: `0`

The optimal way to split this string is into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in penalties of `0` for each subarray, thus the total penalty is `0`.

The provided function would calculate:
- Count of `'+'`: 3
- Count of `'-'`: 3
- Absolute difference: `abs(3 - 3) = 0`

Although the function gives the correct answer for this specific test case, it is not a general solution. For instance, consider the fourth test case:
- Input: `--+++++++-`
- Expected Output: `4`

The optimal way to split this string is into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, resulting in penalties of `2`, `7`, and `1` respectively, thus the total penalty is `10`. However, the function would calculate:
- Count of `'+'`: 7
- Count of `'-'`: 3
- Absolute difference: `abs(7 - 3) = 4`

While the function happens to give the correct answer for this test case, it is not due to the correct logic but rather coincidentally.

### Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum penalty as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
