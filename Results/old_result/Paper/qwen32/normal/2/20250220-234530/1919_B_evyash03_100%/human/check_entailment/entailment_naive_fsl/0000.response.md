Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why this is the case.

The program calculates the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then returns the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty, which involves more complex logic.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
6
+-++--+
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
One optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, -1], [1])`. The penalties for these subarrays are:
- `p([1, -1]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0`
- `p([1, 1]) = |1 + 1| * 2 = 4`
- `p([-1, -1]) = |-1 - 1| * 2 = 4`
- `p([1]) = |1| * 1 = 1`

Total penalty = `0 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 9`, but a better split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`:
- `p([1, -1, 1, -1]) = |1 - 1 + 1 - 1| * 4 = 0`
- `p([1, -1]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0`

Total penalty = `0 + 0 = 0`.

However, another optimal split is `([1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1])`:
- `p([1, -1, 1]) = |1 - 1 + 1| * 3 = 3`
- `p([-1, 1, -1]) = |-1 + 1 - 1| * 3 = 3`

Total penalty = `3 + 3 - 4 = 2`.

The program would incorrectly calculate the penalty as `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is not the minimum penalty.

Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all cases.
