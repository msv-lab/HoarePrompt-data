### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself, then calls `func_1` to compute the penalty.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It counts the number of `'+'` characters in the string.
2. It calculates the number of `'-'` characters by subtracting the count of `'+'` from the total length of the string.
3. It returns the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`.

#### Annotations:
- Before the function call: `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of `'+'` and `'-'`.
- Inside the function: `count` is the number of `'+'` characters in `expression`.
- After computing `sub`: `sub` is the number of `'-'` characters in `expression`.
- The function returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is equivalent to `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

#### Evaluation:
The program's logic is flawed because it does not attempt to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply computes the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`.

Let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `+`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The array is `[1]`, and the penalty is `1`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `-----`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Program Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, and the penalty is `5`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0`
   - Explanation: The array can be split into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty is `0`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `--+++++++--`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array can be split into `([-1, -1], [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1])`, and the penalty is `4`.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The array can be split into several subarrays with minimal penalty.

While the program happens to produce the correct output for these specific test cases, this is coincidental and does not reflect a correct implementation of the problem's requirements. The program does not perform any splitting to minimize the penalty; it only computes the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem optimally. It only happens to give the correct answer for certain specific cases due to the nature of those cases, but it does not guarantee a correct solution for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
