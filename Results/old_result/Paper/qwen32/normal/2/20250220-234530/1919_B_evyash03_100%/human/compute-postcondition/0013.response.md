Given the initial state, `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`, and `sub` is `length - count`.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `sub` and `count` and returns it.

Since `sub` is defined as `length - count`, the expression `abs(sub - count)` simplifies to `abs((length - count) - count)`, which further simplifies to `abs(length - 2*count)`.

Output State: **The program returns the absolute value of (length - 2*count)**.
