### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem optimally. Let's break down why this is the case:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves grouping consecutive elements in such a way that the sum of each subarray is zero, which results in a penalty of zero for that subarray.

2. **Program Logic**: The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string. This calculation does not involve any actual splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. It simply computes a value based on the counts of '+' and '-', which does not guarantee an optimal solution.

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the program correctly outputs `0` because the counts of '+' and '-' are equal, and the optimal split would indeed result in subarrays with a sum of zero.
   - For the input `--++++++-`, the program also outputs `4`, which coincidentally matches the expected output for a specific optimal split. However, this is not due to the logic of the program, which does not perform any splitting to minimize the penalty.

4. **General Case**: The logic of the program does not generalize to all possible inputs. There are many cases where the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' does not correspond to the minimum possible penalty. The program fails to consider the actual splits needed to achieve the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem optimally. It only happens to give the correct answer for certain specific cases due to the nature of those cases, but it does not guarantee a correct solution for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
