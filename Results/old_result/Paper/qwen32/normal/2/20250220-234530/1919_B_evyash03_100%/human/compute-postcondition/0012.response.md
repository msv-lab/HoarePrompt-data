The value of `sub` is calculated as `length - count`. The values of `expression`, `length`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **expression is a string of length length consisting of characters '+' and '-', length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, count is the number of '+' characters in expression, sub is length - count.**
