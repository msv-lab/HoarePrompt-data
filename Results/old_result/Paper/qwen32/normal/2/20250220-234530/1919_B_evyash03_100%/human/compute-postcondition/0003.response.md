Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000, and the current character being evaluated `char` is '+'; `count` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remain unchanged.
