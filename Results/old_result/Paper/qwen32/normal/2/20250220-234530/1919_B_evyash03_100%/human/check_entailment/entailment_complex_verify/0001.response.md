### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
- The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The optimal strategy involves grouping consecutive elements such that the sum of each subarray is zero, which results in a penalty of zero for that subarray.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the penalty for a given string `expression`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Counting '+' Characters**: The program iterates through the string and counts the number of '+' characters.
2. **Calculating '-' Characters**: It calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' from the total length of the string.
3. **Returning the Penalty**: It returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

#### Annotations:
- **Before Function Call**: `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', and `length` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{length} \leq 5000\).
- **Inside Function**: After counting the '+' characters, `count` holds the number of '+' characters in `expression`.
- **After Calculation**: `sub` is calculated as `length - count`, representing the number of '-' characters.
- **Return Statement**: The function returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is equivalent to `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

#### Evaluation:
The program does not actually perform any splitting of the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This approach does not guarantee an optimal solution because it does not consider the actual sums of subarrays or their lengths.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the string `--++++++-`:

- **Optimal Split**: `([-1,-1],[1,-1,1,-1,1,1])` results in a total penalty of `4`.
- **Program Output**: The program calculates:
  - Count of '+': 6
  - Count of '-': 2
  - Penalty: `abs(6 - 2) = 4`

While the program gives the correct answer for this specific case, it is not because of the logic used. The logic is flawed because it does not perform any splitting to minimize the penalty.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem optimally. It only happens to give the correct answer for certain specific cases due to the nature of those cases, but it does not guarantee a correct solution for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
