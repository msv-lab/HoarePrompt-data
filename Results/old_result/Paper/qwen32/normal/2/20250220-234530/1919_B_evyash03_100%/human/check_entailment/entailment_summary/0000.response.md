Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to minimize the total penalty when splitting the array into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The current implementation simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for optimal splitting or the penalty calculation as specified.

The example outputs provided in the problem statement do not match what the given program would produce. For instance, for the third test case with the input string "+-+-+-", the program would output `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, but the correct output should be `0` because the string can be split into subarrays `[1,-1,1,-1]` and `[1,-1]`, both of which have a penalty of `0`.

Therefore, the program's logic is incorrect for solving the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
