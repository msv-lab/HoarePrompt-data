### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to perform a "balanced shuffle" operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves creating a table of prefix balances and positions, sorting this table based on specific criteria, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted table.

2. **Steps in the Provided Program:**
   - **Initialization:** 
     - `s` is the input string.
     - `balance` keeps track of the current balance of the parentheses sequence.
     - `details` is a list that will store tuples of `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in the input string `s`.
       - `balance` is the prefix balance up to but not including the current character.
       - `-i` is used to ensure that in case of ties in balance, the higher position (lower index) comes later in the sorted order.
       - `char` is the current character in the string.
   
   - **Building the Table:**
     - Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
     - Update the `balance` based on whether the character is '(' or ')'.
     - Append a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list.
   
   - **Sorting the Table:**
     - Sort the `details` list. Since Python's sort is stable and uses lexicographical order, the tuples will be sorted first by `balance` (ascending) and then by `-i` (descending, which corresponds to ascending positions).
   
   - **Forming the Result:**
     - Extract the characters from the sorted `details` list and join them to form the final result string.
     - Print the result string.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character.
   - It sorts the characters based on the required criteria.
   - It constructs the final shuffled sequence by extracting the characters from the sorted list.

Given these steps and the logic applied in the code, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
