Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `details` is a list containing three tuples `[(balance, 0, char), (balance, -1, char), (balance, -3, char)]`; `i` is 3; `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is "(", `balance` is increased by 1. If `char` is ")", `balance` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The `details` list now includes an additional tuple `(balance, -3, char)` due to the execution of the `append` method. The values of `s`, `i`, and `char` remain unchanged. The `balance` value is dependent on whether `char` is "(" or ")", but its exact value is not specified and remains as described in the initial state.
