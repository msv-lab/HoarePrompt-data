To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the entire string `s`, which is a balanced parentheses sequence. The loop iterates through each character in `s`, updating the `balance` based on whether the character is an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)`. It also appends a tuple to the `details` list containing the current `balance`, the negative index of the character, and the character itself.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in the loop:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `balance` starts at 0.
   - `details` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `(`, `balance` is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is `)`, `balance` is decremented by 1.
     - A tuple `(balance, -i, char)` is appended to the `details` list, where `i` is the current index of the character in the string.

3. **Final State**:
   - Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, every opening parenthesis `(` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`. This means that by the end of the loop, the `balance` will be 0 because the increments and decrements will cancel each other out.
   - The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in `s`, with the `balance` reflecting the net effect of all previous parentheses up to that point, the negative index of the character, and the character itself.

Given these points, the final output state is:

- `s` remains the same as the input string.
- `balance` will be 0 because the parentheses are balanced.
- `details` will be a list of tuples, one for each character in `s`, with the correct `balance`, negative index, and character.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`, where `balance` reflects the net effect of all previous parentheses up to that point, `-i` is the negative index of the character, and `char` is the character itself.**
