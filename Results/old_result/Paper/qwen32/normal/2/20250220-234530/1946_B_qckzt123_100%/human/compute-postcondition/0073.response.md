The code snippet `ans += t` updates the value of `ans` by adding `t` to it. The values of `t`, `tmp`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given:
- `t` is `((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`
- `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends
- `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`
- `k` must be greater than 1
- `i` is `k - 2`

After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`.

Output State: **`t` is `((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`; `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends; `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`; `k` must be greater than 1; `i` is `k - 2`.**
