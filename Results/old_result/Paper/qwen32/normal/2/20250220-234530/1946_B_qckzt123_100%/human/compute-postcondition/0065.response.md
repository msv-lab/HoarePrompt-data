To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `k - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `k` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 0 and go up to `k - 2`.

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `t`: the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0.
- `tmp`: the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends.
- `ans`: `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

None of these variables (`t`, `tmp`, `ans`) are directly involved in the loop's execution condition. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

However, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 1 to allow the loop to run at least once. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, but since it's part of the `range` function in Python, it will automatically start from 0 when the loop begins.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1**
