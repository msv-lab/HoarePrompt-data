To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables. Here is the code snippet again for reference:

```python
ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0.
- `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends.

The code calculates `ans` using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. This formula ensures that `ans` is a non-negative value modulo `MOD`.

Since the code does not modify `t` or `tmp`, these variables retain their initial values. The only variable that changes is `ans`, which is calculated based on the values of `s`, `t`, and `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0; `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends; `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.**
