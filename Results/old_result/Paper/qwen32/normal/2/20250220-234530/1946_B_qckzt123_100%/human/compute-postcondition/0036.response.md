The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `t` by 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the list `a`) % 1000000007) * 2`
- `tmp` is 0 if the last contiguous subarray sum was negative; otherwise, it is the sum of the last contiguous subarray with a positive sum
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `k` is at least 2
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer
- `MOD` is 1000000007
- `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`
- `i` is 2

After executing `t *= 2`, the new value of `t` will be `(((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the list `a`) % 1000000007) * 2) * 2`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `(((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the list `a`) % 1000000007) * 2) * 2`; `tmp` is 0 if the last contiguous subarray sum was negative; otherwise, it is the sum of the last contiguous subarray with a positive sum; `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `k` are integers such that `k` is at least 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`; `i` is 2**
