Output State: **`t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is `0 + x` if `tmp` was initially `0`; otherwise, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is updated by adding `x` to its current value. The value of `t` depends on the new value of `tmp` and is calculated as `max(0, tmp)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
