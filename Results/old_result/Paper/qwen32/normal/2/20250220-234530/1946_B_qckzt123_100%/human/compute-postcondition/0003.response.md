The given code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `T` is the number of test cases (which is already read and not affected by this line), `n` and `k` are integers for each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `MOD` is a constant.

After executing the line `n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())`, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `t`, `T`, `a`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007.**
