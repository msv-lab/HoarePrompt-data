The given code snippet reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into a list of strings based on spaces, and then maps each string to an integer, resulting in a list of integers. This list replaces the previous value of `a`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a`. The values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer read from the input; `MOD` is 1000000007.**
