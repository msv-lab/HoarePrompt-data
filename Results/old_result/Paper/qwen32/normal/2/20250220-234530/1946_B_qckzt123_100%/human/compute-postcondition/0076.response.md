`t` is multiplied by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `(((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD) * 2 % MOD`; `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends; `ans` is `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t` which is equivalent to `ans % MOD`; `k` must be greater than 1; `i` is `k - 1`.**
