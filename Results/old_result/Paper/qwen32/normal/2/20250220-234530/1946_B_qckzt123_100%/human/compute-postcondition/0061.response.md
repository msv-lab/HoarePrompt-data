Postcondition: **`t` is `max(tmp + x, max(tmp + 2*x, 0))`, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is `((s + t_initial) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains `tmp + x`.**
