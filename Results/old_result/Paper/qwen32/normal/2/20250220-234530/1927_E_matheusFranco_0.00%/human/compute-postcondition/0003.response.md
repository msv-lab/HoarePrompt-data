`t` is decremented by 1, so if `t` was initially greater than 0, after the operation, `t` remains greater than 0 unless it was exactly 1, in which case it would become 0. However, since the initial condition specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, we can safely assume that after decrementing, `t` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0**
