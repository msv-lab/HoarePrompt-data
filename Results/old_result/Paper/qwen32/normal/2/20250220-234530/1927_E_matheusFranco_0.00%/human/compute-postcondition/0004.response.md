The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, but this does not specify a concrete value for `t` that would ensure the loop executes one more time. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be a specific value greater than 0.

Since the condition is `t > 0`, any positive value for `t` would satisfy this condition. However, to be precise and ensure the loop executes one more time, let's assume `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration (a common scenario). Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` should be at least 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be 1**
