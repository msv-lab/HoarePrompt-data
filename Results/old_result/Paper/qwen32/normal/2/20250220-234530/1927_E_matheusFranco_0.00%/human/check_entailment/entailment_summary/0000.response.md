### Reasoning:

Let's analyze whether the provided functions correctly solve the problem of generating a k-level permutation.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to generate a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by at most 1.

#### Analysis of `func_1()`:
- **Input**: Two integers `n` and `k`.
- **Process**:
  - Initializes a list `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
  - Iterates over `k` to distribute values into the `permutation` list.
  - For each index `i` in the range `k`, it places values starting from `curr_v` at positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2k`, etc.
  - The values are sequentially incremented and placed in the permutation list.
- **Output**: Prints the constructed permutation as a space-separated string.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:
- **Input**: An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- **Process**: For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to generate and print the permutation.
- **Output**: None, but `func_1()` handles the printing of each permutation.

#### Verification:
To verify if `func_1()` generates a k-level permutation, let's consider the pattern it uses:
- Values are distributed in a way that ensures each segment of length `k` has a sum that differs by at most 1.
- By placing values in a cyclic manner across segments, the sums of these segments are balanced.

However, the provided `func_1()` does not guarantee that the sums of all segments of length `k` will differ by at most 1. The distribution method used might not achieve the required balance, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

#### Example:
Consider `n=10` and `k=4`:
- `func_1()` would place values in a pattern like `[1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]` and continue filling the gaps.
- This pattern does not ensure that the sums of all segments of length 4 differ by at most 1.

#### Conclusion:
The provided `func_1()` does not guarantee the construction of a k-level permutation as defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
