To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

Given:
- `permutation` is a list of `n` elements.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initialized to 2.

For the loop to execute, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than the length of `permutation`, which is `n`.

### Analysis:
- The length of `permutation` is `n`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 2.

The condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` translates to `2 < n`.

### Conclusion:
Since `n` is given as an integer where `2 <= k <= n`, `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, `2 < n` will be true for any valid `n` greater than 2. However, if `n` is exactly 2, then `2 < n` would be false, and the loop would not execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be strictly greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
No other variables in the loop condition need adjustment besides ensuring `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `n > 2`; `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, and elements at indices `1, 1+k, 1+2*k, ..., 1+floor((n-2)/k)*k` set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 2, floor((n-1)/k) + 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2; `i` is 2**
