To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given the current state:
- `n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `n > 2`.
- `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with specific elements set to certain values.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 2`.
- `i` is 2.

The length of the `permutation` list is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`.

Currently, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 2`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `k + 2 < n`.

Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, the smallest possible value for `k` is 2. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `k + 2` is 4. This means `n` must be greater than 4 to satisfy `k + 2 < n`.

No other states outside of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `n` need to be adjusted according to the loop condition.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `k` is even, `2 <= k <= n`, `k` is even, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, and elements at indices `1, 1+k, 1+2*k, ..., 1+floor((n-2)/k)*k` set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 2, floor((n-1)/k) + 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 2`; except the element at index 2 which is now `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 3`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 2`; `i` is 2**
