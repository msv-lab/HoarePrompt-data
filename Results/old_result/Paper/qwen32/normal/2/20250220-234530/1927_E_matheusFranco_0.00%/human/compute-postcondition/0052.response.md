To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order, but the exact order isn't specified in the initial state.
- `idx` is initialized to 0.
- `idx_v` is initialized to 1.
- `curr_v` is initialized to `n + 1`.
- `result` is a string that represents the space-separated values of the list `permutation`.

Given the initial state, the `permutation` list is not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine its exact content. However, we know it contains integers from 1 to `n` in some order. The `result` variable is constructed as a space-separated string from this list.

Since the exact permutation is not specified, we can only describe the `result` in terms of the `permutation` list.

Therefore, the output will be the space-separated string representation of the `permutation` list.

Output: **result (where result is the space-separated string representation of the permutation list)**
