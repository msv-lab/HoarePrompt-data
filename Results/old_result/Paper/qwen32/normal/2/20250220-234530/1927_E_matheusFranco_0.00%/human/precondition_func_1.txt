This function does not have any parameters in its signature. It reads an integer t from the input, which represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where n is the length of the desired permutation and k is the level of the permutation. It is guaranteed that k is even and 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function then calls `func_1()` t times to process each test case.
