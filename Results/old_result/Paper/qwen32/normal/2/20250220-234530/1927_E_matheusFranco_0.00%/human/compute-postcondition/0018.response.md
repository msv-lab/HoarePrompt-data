The code increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially `2 * k`. After adding `k` to it, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `2 * k + k`, which simplifies to `3 * k`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 1, the element at index `k` set to 2, and the element at index `2 * k` set to 3; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3 * k`.**
