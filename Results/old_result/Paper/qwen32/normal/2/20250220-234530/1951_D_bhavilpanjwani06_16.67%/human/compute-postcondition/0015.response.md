Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ \(10^{18}\) and are assigned the values read from the input. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
