The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, both `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\).

After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ \(10^{18}\) and are assigned the values read from the input.**
