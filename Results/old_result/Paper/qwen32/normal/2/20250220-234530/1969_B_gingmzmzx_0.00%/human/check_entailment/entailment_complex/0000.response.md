### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided program seems to be calculating something different than the required minimum cost. Instead of calculating the cost of cyclic shifts, it calculates the number of valid (0, 1) pairs in the string, which is the number of '0's that appear after at least one '1'. This is not directly related to the minimum cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. Identify the boundary between the sequence of '1's and '0's in the sorted string.
2. Calculate the cost of moving all '1's to the left of all '0's using the minimum number of cyclic shifts.

A more appropriate approach would involve:
- Counting the number of '1's encountered before the first '0'.
- For each subsequent '0', adding the number of '1's encountered so far to the total cost, as each '0' needs to be moved past all previously counted '1's.

The current implementation does not follow this logic and instead counts the number of valid (0, 1) pairs, which is not the same as calculating the minimum cost of sorting the string.

### Conclusion:

Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the functionality of the provided code, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
