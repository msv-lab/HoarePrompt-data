Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and contains at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is updated such that the count of `c` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` after the current `c`. If `c` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])` if `c` is not 0, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`.**
