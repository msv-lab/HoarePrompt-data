The given code snippet resets the value of `ans` to 0. This does not affect the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`). Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0.**
