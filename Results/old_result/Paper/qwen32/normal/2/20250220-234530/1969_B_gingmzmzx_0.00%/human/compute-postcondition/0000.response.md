Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an input integer, while the conditions and constraints on `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
