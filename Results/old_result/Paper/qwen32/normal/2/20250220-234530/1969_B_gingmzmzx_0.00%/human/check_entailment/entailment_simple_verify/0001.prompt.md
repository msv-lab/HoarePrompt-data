You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all zeros followed by all ones) using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of shifting a substring is defined as the length of that substring.

### Program Analysis

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Zeros**: For each binary string `s`, it counts the total number of zeros (`zeroes`).
3. **Tracking Counts**: It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
4. **Calculating Cost**:
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string.
   - If `c` is a zero, it checks if there have been any ones encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). If yes, it adds 1 to the answer because moving this zero past the ones would require a shift.
   - If `c` is a one, it adds the remaining number of zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the answer. This accounts for the cost of moving all remaining zeros past this one.

### Correctness Evaluation

The logic seems flawed because it does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts. Specifically:

- The program assumes that each zero needs to be moved past every one encountered so far, which is not necessarily true for cyclic shifts.
- The program also assumes that each one needs to be moved past every remaining zero, which again does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.

### Counterexample

Consider the string "1010". According to the program:
- It will count 2 zeros and 2 ones.
- When processing the first '1', it will add 2 (remaining zeros) to the answer.
- When processing the second '1', it will add 1 (remaining zero) to the answer.
- Total cost: 3.

However, the optimal solution involves:
- Shifting the substring "10" to get "01" (cost 2).
- No further shifts are needed.
- Total cost: 2.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
