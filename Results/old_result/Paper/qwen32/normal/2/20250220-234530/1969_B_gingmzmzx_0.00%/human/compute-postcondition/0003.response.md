The code snippet counts the number of zeroes in the list `s` and assigns this count to the variable `zeroes`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is 2 ≤ len(s) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`.**
