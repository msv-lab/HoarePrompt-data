The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and contains at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**
