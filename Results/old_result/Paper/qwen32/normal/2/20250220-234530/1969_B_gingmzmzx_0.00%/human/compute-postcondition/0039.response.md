The given code snippet increments the variable `ans` by 1 if the second element of the list `cnt` is greater than 0. Otherwise, it does not change `ans`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Since `cnt` is either `[2, 0]` or `[0, 2]`, the condition `cnt[1] > 0` will be true if `cnt` is `[0, 2]` and false if `cnt` is `[2, 0]`.

Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by 1 only if `cnt` is `[0, 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[2, 0]` if `c` was 0 or `[0, 2]` if `c` was 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt` is `[0, 2]`.**
