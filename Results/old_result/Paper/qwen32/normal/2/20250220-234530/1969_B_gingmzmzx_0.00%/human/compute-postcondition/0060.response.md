Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and contains at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is `[0, 1]` else `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
