The given code snippet increments the variable `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` (the count of 1s in the list `s`) is greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, where `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

The only variable that could be affected by the code snippet is `ans`. The value of `ans` will increase by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`**.
