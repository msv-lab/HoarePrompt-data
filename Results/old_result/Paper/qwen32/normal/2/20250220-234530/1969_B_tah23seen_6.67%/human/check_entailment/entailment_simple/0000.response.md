### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem of sorting a binary string with the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the `func_1` function that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Swap Logic**: The program swaps elements directly when it encounters a '0' at a higher index (`right`) and a '1' at a lower index (`left`). This swap operation is not equivalent to a cyclic shift of the substring, which is required by the problem statement. A direct swap does not account for the cost structure defined by the problem, which is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `cost += right - left + 1` assumes that swapping `s[right]` and `s[left]` is equivalent to performing a cyclic shift of the substring from `left` to `right`. This is incorrect because a cyclic shift involves moving a segment of the string, not just swapping two elements.

3. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions and the way `left` and `right` are updated do not ensure that all necessary cyclic shifts are considered. The program may miss opportunities to reduce the cost further by considering larger substrings for cyclic shifts.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings that are already sorted or strings that require multiple cyclic shifts to be sorted.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string as per the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
