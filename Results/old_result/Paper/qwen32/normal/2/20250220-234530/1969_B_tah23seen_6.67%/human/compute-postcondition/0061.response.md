To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

Given the current state:
- `right` is `len(s)`
- `left` is `4`
- `len(s)` must be greater than `3`
- `s[3]` must not be '1'

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition: `left < len(s)`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is `4`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `left` must still be less than `len(s)`.
   - Since `left` is `4`, `len(s)` must be greater than `4` to satisfy this condition.

2. **Condition: `s[left] != '1'`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is `4`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `s[4]` (the character at index `4`) must not be `'1'`.

From these analyses, we can conclude that:
- `len(s)` must be greater than `4`.
- `s[4]` must not be `'1'`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head conditions.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`right` is `len(s)`, `left` is `4`, `len(s)` must be greater than `4`, and `s[4]` must not be '1'**
