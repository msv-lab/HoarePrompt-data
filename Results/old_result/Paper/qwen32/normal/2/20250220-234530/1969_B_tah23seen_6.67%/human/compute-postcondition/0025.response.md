To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[0]` being '0'.
- `left` is 1.
- `right` is len(s).

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `left < len(s)`: Since `left` is 1 and `s` has at least two elements (as per the condition \(2 \leq \text{len}(s)\)), this condition is satisfied.
2. `s[left] != '1'`: For the loop to execute again, `s[left]` must be '0'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `left` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s[1]` must be '0'. If `s[1]` is already '0', no adjustment is needed. However, if `s[1]` is '1', we need to adjust it to '0'.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `s[1]` to '0' if it is not already.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[0]` being '0' and `s[1]` being '0'; `left` is 1; `right` is len(s)**
