Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `s` will contain all the strings from the list `sChar`, preserving their order. The constraints on the strings in `sChar` remain the same as initially described.
