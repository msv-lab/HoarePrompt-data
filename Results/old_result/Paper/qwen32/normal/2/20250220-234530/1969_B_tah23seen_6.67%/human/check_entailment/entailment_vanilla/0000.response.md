Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to transform a binary string into a non-decreasing order (i.e., all 0s should come before all 1s) using the minimum cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` of characters.
   - Initializes `left` pointer at 0 and `right` pointer at 1.
   - Initializes `cost` to 0.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left <= right` and both pointers are within the bounds of the string.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these two elements and adds the cost `(right - left + 1)` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0'.
   - Similarly, it moves the `left` pointer to the next '1'.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the accumulated `cost`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Logic Flaw**: The program attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, which does not guarantee the minimum cost. Cyclic shifting involves moving a substring, not just swapping individual characters.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `(right - left + 1)` is correct for a single operation but does not account for the optimal sequence of operations needed to sort the entire string.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the string is already sorted or where there are multiple '0's and '1's that need to be moved in a specific order.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the third test case: `11000`.
- The program would initially set `left` at the first '1' and `right` at the first '0'.
- It would swap them, incurring a cost of 3 (since `right - left + 1 = 3`).
- However, this does not necessarily lead to the minimum cost solution. The optimal solution involves multiple operations with different substrings.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem due to its flawed logic and incorrect handling of the cyclic shift operation.

**Correctness: False**
