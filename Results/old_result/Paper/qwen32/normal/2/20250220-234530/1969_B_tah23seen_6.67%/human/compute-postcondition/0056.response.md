To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `right` is `len(s) - 1`
- `left` is `3` (though `left` is not part of the loop condition, it is mentioned for completeness)
- `s[len(s) - 2]` is not '0'

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition: `right < len(s)`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `right` is `len(s) - 1`. This means `right` is already at the last index of the string `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `right` would need to be less than `len(s)`. Since `right` is currently `len(s) - 1`, this condition is not satisfied.

2. **Condition: `s[right] != '0'`**
   - The problem states that `s[len(s) - 2]` is not '0', but it does not provide information about `s[len(s) - 1]` (which is `s[right]`).
   - To satisfy this condition, `s[right]` should not be '0'. However, since `right` is already at the last index and the first condition (`right < len(s)`) is not met, adjusting `s[right]` to not be '0' won't help because the loop won't start another iteration due to the first condition failing.

Since the first condition `right < len(s)` is not satisfied, the loop cannot execute one more time with the current state. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `right` to be less than `len(s)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `right` to be `len(s) - 2` (or any value less than `len(s) - 1`), and ensure `s[right]` is not '0'.

State: **`right` is `len(s) - 2`, `left` is `3`, and `s[right]` is not '0'**
