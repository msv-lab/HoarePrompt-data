Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a string `s`. For each string, it checks if the string has a length of 1 or consists of identical characters. If so, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of the string, which is either a shuffled version of the string or the string rotated by one position if the shuffle did not change the order.**
