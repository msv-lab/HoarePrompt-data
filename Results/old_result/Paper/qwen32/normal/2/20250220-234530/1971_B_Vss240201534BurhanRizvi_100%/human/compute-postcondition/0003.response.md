Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- Initial State: 
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
  - `s` is the input string with a length of 1.

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  print('No')
  ```

In this case, the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. The values of `t` and `s` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
