The code snippet `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the string `s` and rearranges it such that the first character of `s` is moved to the end of the string, while the rest of the characters remain in their original order.

Given the initial state, `s2` was described as containing all characters from `s` but in a random order. After executing the code, `s2` specifically becomes the string `s` with its first character moved to the end.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string; `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end.**
