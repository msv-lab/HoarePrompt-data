Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string; `s2` is a string that contains all characters from `s` but in a random order.**

Explanation: The variable `s2` is created by taking all characters from the input string `s` and arranging them in a random order. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
