To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the newly input string.
- `s2` is either `s` (if `s` equals `s2`) or `s[1:] + s[0]` (if `s` does not equal `s2`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `s`, and `s2`. It will always print `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
