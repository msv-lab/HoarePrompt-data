The code snippet rotates the string `s` by moving its first character to the end, and assigns the result to `s2`. Given that initially `s` is equal to `s2`, after executing the code, `s2` will be the rotated version of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string with a length greater than 1 and does not consist of all identical characters, `s2` is the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end.**
