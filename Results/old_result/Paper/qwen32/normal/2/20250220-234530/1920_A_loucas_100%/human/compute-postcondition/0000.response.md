The code snippet `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This affects the value of `loop` but does not change the initial conditions of `t`, `n`, or the constraints.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and there are constraints represented by pairs (a, x), these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case; `loop` is an input integer.**
