Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `innerLoop` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a`, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing `a`. `iterable2` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is `[a, a]` if `x` is 1, `[a]` if `x` is 2, or an empty list otherwise, `less` is an empty list if `x` is 1, a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, or an empty list otherwise, `no` is an empty list if `x` is 1 or 2, or a list containing `a` otherwise, `iterable2` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
