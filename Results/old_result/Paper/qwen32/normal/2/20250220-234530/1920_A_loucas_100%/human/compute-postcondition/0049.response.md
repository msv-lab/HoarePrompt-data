To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the expression used to define `num`.

Given:
- `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count_in_range`

We need to understand the values of `min(less)`, `max(big)`, and `count_in_range` based on the initial state provided:

1. **`min(less)`**: This represents the minimum value in the list `less`.
2. **`max(big)`**: This represents the maximum value in the list `big`.
3. **`count_in_range`**: This is presumably the count of some elements within a specified range, but without additional context about the range or the lists `less` and `big`, we'll treat it as a known value.

Let's denote these values symbolically:
- Let `min_less` be the minimum value in the list `less`.
- Let `max_big` be the maximum value in the list `big`.
- Let `count_in_range` be the count of elements in the specified range.

Thus, `num` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{num} = \text{min\_less} - \text{max\_big} + 1 - \text{count\_in\_range} \]

Without specific values for `less`, `big`, and `count_in_range`, we cannot compute a numerical value for `num`. However, we can describe the expression precisely based on the given information.

Therefore, the output of the `print(num)` statement will be the result of the above expression.

Output: **num (where num is calculated as min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count_in_range)**
