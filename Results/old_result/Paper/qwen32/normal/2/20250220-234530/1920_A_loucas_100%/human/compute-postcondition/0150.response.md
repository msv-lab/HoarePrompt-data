Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. The function processes each test case based on the constraints and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, if there is a constraint of type 1 and type 2, it performs some computation or check (implied by the problem context but not detailed here), and returns a corresponding result.**
