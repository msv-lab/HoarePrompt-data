Postcondition: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and `num` is less than 1, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.**
