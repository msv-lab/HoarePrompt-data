To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- The expression `min(less) - max(big) + 1` is provided but it is not directly assigned to any variable. 
- There is no explicit mention of a variable named `num` in the initial state.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(num)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(num)` statement attempts to print the value of a variable named `num`.
- However, there is no definition or assignment of `num` in the provided initial state or the code snippet.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, it is impossible to determine the value of `num` because it is not defined anywhere in the initial state or the code snippet. Therefore, the code would result in a `NameError` if executed, as `num` is not recognized.

However, since the task is to describe the output based on the given information and format, we'll describe the situation as follows:

Output: **NameError: name 'num' is not defined** (since `num` is not defined in the given context)
