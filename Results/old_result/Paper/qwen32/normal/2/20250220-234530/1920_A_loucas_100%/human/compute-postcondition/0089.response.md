The code snippet `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is initially defined as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. After decrementing `num` by 1, its new value will be `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `min(less) - max(big)`.

The other variables (`iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`, `no`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element, and `i` is such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`**.
