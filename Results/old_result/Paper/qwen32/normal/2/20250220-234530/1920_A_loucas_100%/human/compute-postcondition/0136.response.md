Postcondition: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`; `iterable` is 4; `loop` is greater than 4; `innerLoop` is the input integer; `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1; `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2; `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. If `num` is less than 1, the conditions remain as specified.**
