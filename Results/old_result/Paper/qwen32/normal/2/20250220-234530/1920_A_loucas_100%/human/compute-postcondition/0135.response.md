The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, none of the variables are directly modified by the `continue` statement. The control flow changes, but the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and `num` is less than 1; `iterable` is 4; `loop` is greater than 4; `innerLoop` is the input integer; `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1; `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2; `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.**
