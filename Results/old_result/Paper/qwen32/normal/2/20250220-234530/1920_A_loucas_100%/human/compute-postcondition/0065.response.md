Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and `x` is not equal to 1, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
