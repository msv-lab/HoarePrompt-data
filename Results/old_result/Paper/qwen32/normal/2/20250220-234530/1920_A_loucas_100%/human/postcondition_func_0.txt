The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of integers that satisfy certain conditions derived from the constraints. Specifically, it computes how many integers lie between the minimum value of type 2 constraints and the maximum value of type 1 constraints, excluding any values that are explicitly listed in type 3 constraints. If no such integers exist, it prints 0.
