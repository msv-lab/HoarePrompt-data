Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is the number of nodes, `m` is the number of edges, and `k` is another integer. It also receives `m` lines of three integers each, representing edges between nodes and a value associated with each edge. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
