Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values read during the last iteration, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of dividing its original value by `gcd`. All other variables retain their previous values.
