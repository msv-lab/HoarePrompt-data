The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `t-1`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
