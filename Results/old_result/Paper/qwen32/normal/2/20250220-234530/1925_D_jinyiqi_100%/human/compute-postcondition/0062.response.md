To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the variables evolve through each iteration and what their final states will be once the loop completes.

Here's a summary of the key variables and their transformations within the loop:

1. **Loop Control Variable (`i`)**: This variable starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `t`.
2. **Input Variables (`n`, `m`, `k`)**: These are read at the start of each iteration and do not change within an iteration.
3. **Sum of `f` Values (`sum_f`)**: This accumulates the sum of `f` values for each edge provided in the `m` lines of input.
4. **Combinatorial Calculation (`cn2`)**: This is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` at the start of each iteration and does not change within an iteration.
5. **Numerator (`p`)**: Calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, then divided by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `p` and `q`.
6. **Denominator (`q`)**: Calculated as `2 * cn2`, then divided by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `p` and `q`.
7. **Greatest Common Divisor (`gcd`)**: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` before they are simplified.
8. **Final Output**: Computed as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, where `M` is 10.

After all `t` iterations, the loop control variable `i` will have reached `t`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) will reflect the values from the last iteration.

### Final Output State:
- **`i`**: `t` (since the loop runs `t` times).
- **`n`**: The value of `n` from the last iteration.
- **`m`**: The value of `m` from the last iteration.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` from the last iteration.
- **`sum_f`**: The sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations of the last test case.
- **`cn2`**: Calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` for the last test case.
- **`p`**: Calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd` for the last test case.
- **`q`**: Calculated as `2 * cn2 // gcd` for the last test case.
- **`gcd`**: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q` for the last test case.
- **Output**: The final result printed for the last test case, which is `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

Output State: **`i` is `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd` are from the last iteration, and the output is the final result printed for the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop control variable `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases `t`, and the other variables will hold the values corresponding to the last test case processed. The final output will be the result of the computation for the last test case.
