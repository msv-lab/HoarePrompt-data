### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution to determine if the implementation correctly addresses the problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value.
- The teacher selects `k` pairs of children randomly and independently.
- If a selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future selections.
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions and express it as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).
- The final result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Provided Solution Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:** The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:** It sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
3. **Calculating Combinations:** It calculates the number of ways to choose any two children out of `n`, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
4. **Computing Numerator (p) and Denominator (q):**
   - Numerator \(p\) is calculated as \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\).
   - Denominator \(q\) is calculated as \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\).
5. **Simplifying the Fraction:** The solution simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
6. **Modular Inverse:** Finally, it computes the modular inverse of the simplified denominator modulo \(10^9+7\) and multiplies it with the simplified numerator to get the result.

#### Analysis of the Formula:
The formula used in the solution appears to be incorrect. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Numerator (p):** The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) does not accurately represent the expected contribution of the initial friendship values. The expected value calculation involves more complex combinatorial considerations and the evolving nature of friendship values over multiple excursions.
- **Denominator (q):** The term \(2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2\) does not correctly represent the total number of possible outcomes for selecting pairs over `k` excursions, especially considering the dependency introduced by the increasing friendship values.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- The probability of selecting a particular friend pair in each excursion.
- The evolving friendship values over multiple excursions.
- The expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum of friendship values.

The provided solution does not account for these complexities and thus cannot be considered correct.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided solution does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the correctness of the solution is:

Final: **False**
