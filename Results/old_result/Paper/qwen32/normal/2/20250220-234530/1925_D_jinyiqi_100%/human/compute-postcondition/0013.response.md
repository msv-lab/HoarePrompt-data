Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 2 * f + f, `a` is the first of the new input integers, `b` is the second of the new input integers, `f` is the third of the new input integers, `j` is 2**.

In natural language: The value of `sum_f` has been updated to be the initial value of `2 * f` plus the new value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
