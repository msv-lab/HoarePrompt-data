To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `f`, then adds `f` to `sum_f`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the changes:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4 (unchanged).
  - `i`: 0 (unchanged).
  - `n`: The first input integer (unchanged).
  - `m`: The second input integer, which determines the number of iterations (unchanged).
  - `k`: The third input integer (unchanged).
  - `sum_f`: 0 (initially).

- **Loop Iterations**:
  - For each iteration `j` from 0 to `m-1`:
    - Reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `f`.
    - Adds `f` to `sum_f`.

After `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read during the loop.

**Final Output State**:
- `t`: Remains the same as the input integer.
- `i`: Remains 0.
- `n`: Remains the first input integer.
- `m`: Remains the second input integer.
- `k`: Remains the third input integer.
- `sum_f`: The sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations.
- `j`: Will be `m-1` after the last iteration, but since `j` is a loop variable, it does not persist outside the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations.**
