The code appends the first line of input (which is a binary string of length `n`) to the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the second binary string remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing the first binary string.**
