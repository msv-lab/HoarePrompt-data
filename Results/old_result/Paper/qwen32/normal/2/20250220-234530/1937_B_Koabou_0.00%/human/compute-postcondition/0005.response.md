The code appends a new input (which is expected to be a binary string of length `n`) to the list `a`. 

Given the initial state, `a` already contains the first binary string. After executing the code, `a` will contain two binary strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `_` is 1**.
