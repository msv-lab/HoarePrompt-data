Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The first and second lines of each test case contain binary strings of length n, representing the rows a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n} and a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
