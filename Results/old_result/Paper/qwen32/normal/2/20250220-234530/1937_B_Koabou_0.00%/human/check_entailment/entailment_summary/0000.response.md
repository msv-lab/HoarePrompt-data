### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Objective**: Find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string.
2. **Path Constraints**: The grasshopper can move right or downwards.
3. **Lexicographical Order**: Among all possible paths, we need to find the smallest string when the path is represented as a sequence of grid values.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings representing the grid.
- It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string `s` by iterating through the columns and making decisions based on the values in the grid.
- The logic for constructing `s` seems flawed:
  - It checks if there is a point where moving down from the top row to the bottom row results in a lexicographically smaller string.
  - If such a point is found, it constructs the string `s` accordingly.
  - If no such point is found, it defaults to concatenating the entire top row with the last character of the bottom row.
- After constructing `s`, it calculates the number of paths that yield this string, but the calculation seems incorrect:
  - It sets `t` to `x - i + 1` under certain conditions, which doesn't accurately represent the number of paths leading to the lexicographically smallest string.

#### Issues Identified:
- The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is incorrect. It doesn't consider all possible paths and their corresponding strings.
- The method for calculating the number of paths that yield the smallest string is flawed. It doesn't correctly count all paths that produce the smallest string.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Explore all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.
2. Construct the string for each path.
3. Track the lexicographically smallest string encountered.
4. Count the number of paths that yield this smallest string.

Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
