Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; the first and second lines of each test case contain binary strings of length `n`; `a` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing the first binary string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `_` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; the third line of each test case contains yet another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing three binary strings; `_` is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
