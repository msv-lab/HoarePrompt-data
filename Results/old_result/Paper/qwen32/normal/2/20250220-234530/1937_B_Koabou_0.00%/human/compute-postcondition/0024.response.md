Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`; `x` is `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is now set to the value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous states and constraints.
