The code snippet creates a new string `s` by concatenating the first `i + 1` characters of the first binary string in the list `a` with the substring of the second binary string starting from index `i` to the end. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `i` is incremented by 1 before the operation.

Given that `i` was initially `i`, after the operation `i` becomes `i + 1`. The new string `s` is formed as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`.**
