You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: i is equal to numCases, numbers is [], suma is the cumulative sum of the minimums of all pairs from all test cases, numInteger is the last input integer read, t remains unchanged, numCases remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `2n` positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform `n` moves.
- Each move involves selecting two integers `x` and `y`, adding `min(x, y)` to our score, and erasing `x` and `y`.
- Our goal is to maximize the final score after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of integers `2n`.
2. Reads the integers and sorts them in ascending order.
3. Iteratively picks pairs of integers from the sorted list, adds the smaller one to the score, and removes both integers from the list.
4. Prints the final score for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
The strategy used in the program is to always pick the smallest available integers first. This ensures that we are maximizing the sum of the minimum values of each pair, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the final score.

#### Why This Works:
- By sorting the list in ascending order, the smallest elements are at the beginning.
- When we pick the first two elements in each iteration, we are essentially picking the smallest pair available, which maximizes the contribution to the score.
- This approach ensures that we are always making the optimal choice in each step, leading to the maximum possible score.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Single Pair Case (n=1):**
   - Input: `1\n2 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
   - **Explanation:** The smallest pair is `(2, 3)`, so the score is `min(2, 3) = 2`.

2. **Multiple Identical Elements (n=2):**
   - Input: `2\n1 1 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`
   - **Explanation:** The pairs could be `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, resulting in a score of `1 + 1 = 2`.

3. **All Elements Identical (n=3):**
   - Input: `3\n1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: `3`
   - **Explanation:** All pairs are `(1, 1)`, resulting in a score of `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

4. **Larger Numbers (n=5):**
   - Input: `5\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100`
   - Expected Output: `150`
   - Program Output: `150`
   - **Explanation:** The pairs could be `(10, 20)`, `(30, 40)`, `(50, 60)`, `(70, 80)`, and `(90, 100)`, resulting in a score of `10 + 30 + 50 + 70 + 90 = 250`.

Based on the analysis and testing of various scenarios, the program appears to correctly implement the strategy to maximize the score.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always picking the smallest available integers in each move, ensuring the optimal solution for all test cases.
