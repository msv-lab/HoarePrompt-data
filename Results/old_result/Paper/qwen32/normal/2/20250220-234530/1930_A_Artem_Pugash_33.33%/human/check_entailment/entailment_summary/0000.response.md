### Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Reading Input:** The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting:** The list of integers is sorted in ascending order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`).
3. **Pairing and Summing Minimums:** The program then iteratively pairs the smallest remaining integers (by popping them from the front of the sorted list) and adds the minimum of each pair to the score `suma`.
4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the computed score for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Optimal Strategy:** The strategy of sorting the list in ascending order and always pairing the smallest available integers ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible relative to the remaining integers. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the sum of the minimums.
- **Implementation Details:** The implementation correctly handles the input reading, sorting, and pairing logic. The use of `pop(0)` ensures that the smallest elements are always considered first, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 (only one pair to consider) and when all integers are the same (all pairs contribute the same minimum value).

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the final score by always pairing the smallest available integers. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
