To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.
   - It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the prefix sum `i - offset` after `i` steps.
   - The `offset` is used to handle negative indices by shifting them into the positive range.
   - For each element in the prefix sum array, it updates the `dp` array considering both possible increments (+1 or -1).
   - Finally, it returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum after all steps.

2. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the number of valid arrays for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The logic in `func_1` seems correct for counting the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sums using a dynamic programming approach. It correctly handles the transitions between states by considering both possible increments (+1 or -1) at each step.
- **Handling Negative Indices**: The use of `offset` to handle negative indices is a common technique in dynamic programming problems involving ranges that include negative numbers.
- **Modulo Operation**: The results are computed modulo `998,244,353` as required by the problem statement.
- **Input Parsing**: The input parsing in `func_2` is straightforward and correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It correctly counts the number of valid arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum arrays `p`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
