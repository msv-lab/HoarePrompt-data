To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider how the variables evolve with each iteration and how they will look after `t` iterations.

From the provided information, we know:
- `t` is the total number of iterations the loop will perform.
- `index` keeps track of our position in the `data` list.
- `n` and `p` are updated in each iteration based on the current `index`.
- `results` accumulates the results from each call to `func_1(n, p)`.

After `t` iterations, the `index` will have advanced through all the necessary elements in the `data` list, and `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of a call to `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in each iteration.

Let's break down the final state:

1. **`t`**: This remains unchanged as it represents the total number of iterations.
2. **`index`**: After `t` iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last `p` list processed. The exact value can be calculated by summing up the lengths of all `p` lists and the corresponding `n` values processed.
3. **`results`**: This will be a list of length `t`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in each iteration.
4. **`n` and `p`**: These will reflect the values used in the last iteration of the loop.

### Calculation of Final `index`
The `index` starts at 1. For each iteration, it advances by 1 (to get `n`) and then by `n` (to get the `p` list). Therefore, after `t` iterations, the `index` will be:
\[ \text{final\_index} = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{t} (1 + n_i) \]
where \( n_i \) is the value of `n` in the \( i \)-th iteration.

### Final Output State
- `t` remains the same.
- `index` is calculated as described above.
- `results` contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in each iteration.
- `n` and `p` reflect the values used in the last iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in each iteration; `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` remains the same, `index` points just past the last processed `p` list, `results` contains all the results from each iteration, and `n` and `p` are the values from the last iteration.
