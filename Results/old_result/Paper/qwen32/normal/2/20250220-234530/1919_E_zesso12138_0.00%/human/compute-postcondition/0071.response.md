To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the line `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`.
- `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except:
  - `new_dp[j + 1]` is `((dp[j]) % MOD + (dp[j]) % MOD) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `dp[j] > 0`.
  - `new_dp[j - 1]` is `((dp[j]) % MOD + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[j] > 0`.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `j` is 2.

### Code Execution:
Given the code snippet `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`:
- Since `dp` is a list of zeros, `dp[j]` is 0.
- Therefore, `new_dp[j + 1]` remains unchanged because `(new_dp[j + 1] + 0) % MOD` is just `new_dp[j + 1]`.

### Output State:
Since `dp[j]` is 0, adding `dp[j]` to `new_dp[j + 1]` does not change `new_dp[j + 1]`. All other parts of the `new_dp` list remain as they were initialized.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`; `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `((dp[j]) % MOD + (dp[j]) % MOD) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `dp[j] > 0`; `new_dp[j - 1]` is `((dp[j]) % MOD + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[j] > 0`; `i` is 2; `n` is at least 0; `j` is 2.**
