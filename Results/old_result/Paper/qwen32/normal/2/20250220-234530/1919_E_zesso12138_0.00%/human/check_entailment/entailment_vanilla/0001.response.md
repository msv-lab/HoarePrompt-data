### Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when we compute the prefix sums `p` and sort them, we get the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

#### Explanation of the Provided Code:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the prefix sum `i - offset` (where `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices).
   - It iterates through each element in the array `p` and updates the DP array based on the possible transitions from the previous state (either adding `1` or `-1`).
   - Finally, it returns the value at the position corresponding to the final sum of `p` adjusted by the offset.

2. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results accordingly.

#### Analysis:

- The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
- The use of an offset (`n`) ensures that all possible prefix sums (which can range from `-n` to `n`) are mapped to valid indices in the DP array.
- The transitions in the DP array correctly account for the addition of `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
- The modulo operation ensures that the results do not overflow and remain within the required bounds.

#### Testing Against Examples:

- The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code:
  - For `n=1` and `p=[0]`, the output is `0` because there is no way to have a prefix sum of `0` with just one element.
  - For `n=1` and `p=[1]`, the output is `1` because the only possible array is `[1]`.
  - For `n=3` and `p=[-1, 1, 2]`, the output is `0` because there is no valid array `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
  - For `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, the output is `3` because there are three valid arrays `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
  - For `n=5` and `p=[-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`, the output is `1` because there is only one valid array `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles the constraints appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
