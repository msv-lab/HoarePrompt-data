You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when we compute the prefix sums `p` and sort them, we get the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

#### Explanation of the Provided Code:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the prefix sum `i - offset` (where `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices).
   - It iterates through each element in the array `p` and updates the DP array based on the possible transitions from the previous state (either adding `1` or `-1`).
   - Finally, it returns the value at the position corresponding to the final sum of `p` adjusted by the offset.

2. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results accordingly.

#### Analysis:

- The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
- The use of an offset (`n`) ensures that all possible prefix sums (which can range from `-n` to `n`) are mapped to valid indices in the DP array.
- The transitions in the DP array correctly account for the addition of `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
- The modulo operation ensures that the results do not overflow and remain within the required bounds.

#### Testing Against Examples:

- The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code:
  - For `n=1` and `p=[0]`, the output is `0` because there is no way to have a prefix sum of `0` with just one element.
  - For `n=1` and `p=[1]`, the output is `1` because the only possible array is `[1]`.
  - For `n=3` and `p=[-1, 1, 2]`, the output is `0` because there is no valid array `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
  - For `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, the output is `3` because there are three valid arrays `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
  - For `n=5` and `p=[-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`, the output is `1` because there is only one valid array `a` that can produce this sorted prefix sum array.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles the constraints appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
