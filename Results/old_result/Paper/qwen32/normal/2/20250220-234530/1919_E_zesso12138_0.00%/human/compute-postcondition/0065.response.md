Output State: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `((dp[j]) % MOD + (dp[j]) % MOD) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j]) % MOD`. `i` is 2, `n` is at least 0, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to be the sum of its current value and `dp[j]`, both taken modulo `MOD`. All other parts of the state remain unchanged.
