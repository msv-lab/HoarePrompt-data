Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description to identify any discrepancies.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide a specific string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`, but it does not do this correctly.
   - The function seems to be checking for the presence of all characters in `s` and then constructing a new string, but it does not ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1` removes characters from the set `alphabet` as they appear in `s`. This approach does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.
   - The logic for constructing the missing string (`s2 + be9i`) is flawed and does not ensure that it is the correct missing subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `n` is larger than `m` (length of `s`), which means no string of length `n` can possibly be a subsequence.
   - The code does not correctly identify the missing subsequence when `s` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `n`.

#### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the provided code might not correctly identify `aa` as the missing subsequence because of its flawed logic.

#### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
