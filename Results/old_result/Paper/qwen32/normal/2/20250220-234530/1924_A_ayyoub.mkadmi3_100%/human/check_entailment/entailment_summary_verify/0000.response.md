### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to verify if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide a specific string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of a main loop that handles multiple test cases and a helper function `func_1` that processes each test case. Let's break down the code:

1. **Main Loop**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - Calls `func_1` with `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, it either prints "YES" or "NO" followed by a missing subsequence if applicable.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - Creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - Iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it adds the character to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` has more than one character, it removes the character from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has only one character left, it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - Computes `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function summary states that `func_1` checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a tuple with a boolean, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`.
- However, this summary does not capture the intended functionality of checking all possible subsequences of length `n`.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - It only checks for the presence of characters and resets the alphabet when a character repeats, which is not sufficient to verify all subsequences.

2. **Constructing Missing Subsequence**:
   - The logic for constructing the missing subsequence (`s2 + be9i`) is flawed.
   - It does not ensure that the constructed string is indeed a missing subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `n` is larger than `m` (length of `s`), which means no string of length `n` can possibly be a subsequence.
   - The code does not correctly identify the missing subsequence when `s` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `n`.

#### Example Case Analysis:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the provided code might not correctly identify `aa` as the missing subsequence because of its flawed logic.

#### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
