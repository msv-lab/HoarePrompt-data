Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the last character of `s1`.**

To break it down:
- The first element of the tuple is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) which checks if the length of `s1` (which is the same as the length of `s`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
- The second element is a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of the string. Here, `r` is calculated as `len(s) // k`.
- The third element is the last character of `s1`, which is stored in `s2`.

So, the output state includes these three computed values.
