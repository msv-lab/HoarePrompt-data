`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 32. The precondition about the test cases and their strings remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**
