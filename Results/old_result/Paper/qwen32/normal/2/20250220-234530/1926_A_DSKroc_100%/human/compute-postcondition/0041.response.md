The code snippet `bc += 1` increments the value of `bc` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `q`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `s` is a non-empty string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next character in the string `s` following the current `i`, `bc` is incremented by 1.**
