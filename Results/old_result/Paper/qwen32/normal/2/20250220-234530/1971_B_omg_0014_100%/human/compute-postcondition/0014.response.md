Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`, and the length of `a` is not equal to 1; `b` is the string formed by sorting the characters of `s` in ascending order; `c` is the string formed by sorting the characters of `s` in descending order. If `s` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, then `s` equals `b`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `s`.**
