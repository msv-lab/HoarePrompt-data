You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are identical. If they are, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already in lexicographically smallest order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking Unique Characters:**
   - It converts the string `s` into a set `a`. This set will contain unique characters from the string.
   - If the length of this set is 1 (`len(a) == 1`), it means all characters in the string are the same. In this case, it prints "NO" because no rearrangement can produce a different string.

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If the length of the set is more than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string.
   - The program then creates two sorted versions of the string:
     - `b`: The string sorted in ascending order.
     - `c`: The string sorted in descending order.
   - It checks if the original string `s` is equal to the ascending sorted string `b`.
     - If `s` is equal to `b`, it prints the descending sorted string `c`.
     - Otherwise, it prints the ascending sorted string `b`.

4. **Ensuring Different Output:**
   - By using either the ascending or descending sorted version of the string, the program ensures that the output string `r` is different from the input string `s` when there are at least two different characters in `s`.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `codeforces`
  - Unique characters: Yes.
  - Sorted ascending: `ccdeeefors`
  - Since `codeforces` != `ccdeeefors`, it prints "YES" followed by `ccdeeefors` (or any other valid permutation).

- **Test Case 2:** `aaaaa`
  - Unique characters: No.
  - Prints "NO".

- **Test Case 3:** `xxxxy`
  - Unique characters: Yes.
  - Sorted ascending: `xxxxxy`
  - Since `xxxxy` != `xxxxxy`, it prints "YES" followed by `xxxxxy` (or any other valid permutation).

- **Test Case 4:** `co`
  - Unique characters: Yes.
  - Sorted ascending: `co`
  - Since `co` == `co`, it prints "YES" followed by `oc`.

- **Test Case 5:** `d`
  - Unique characters: No.
  - Prints "NO".

- **Test Case 6:** `nutdealer`
  - Unique characters: Yes.
  - Sorted ascending: `aeldeeinrt`
  - Since `nutdealer` != `aeldeeinrt`, it prints "YES" followed by `aeldeeinrt` (or any other valid permutation).

- **Test Case 7:** `mwistht`
  - Unique characters: Yes.
  - Sorted ascending: `himsttw`
  - Since `mwistht` != `himsttw`, it prints "YES" followed by `himsttw` (or any other valid permutation).

- **Test Case 8:** `hhhhhhhhhh`
  - Unique characters: No.
  - Prints "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. It prints "NO" when no rearrangement can produce a different string and prints "YES" followed by a valid rearranged string otherwise.
