The code calculates the value of `p` using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. Given that `n` is the number of elements in the sorted list `a`, the value of `p` will be the index of the middle element if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even. 

Since `n` is a new input integer and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, these remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
