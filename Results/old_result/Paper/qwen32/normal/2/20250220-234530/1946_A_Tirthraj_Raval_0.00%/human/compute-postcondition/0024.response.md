Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases (a positive integer between 1 and 10,000), and for each test case, it accepts `n`, the number of integers in the list (a positive integer between 1 and 100,000), and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
