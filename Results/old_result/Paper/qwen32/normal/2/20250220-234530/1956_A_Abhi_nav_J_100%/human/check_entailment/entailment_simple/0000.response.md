### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Input Parsing:
- The input is read correctly, and the values are parsed into variables `k`, `q`, `k_wali_list`, and `q_wali_list`.
- `k_wali_list` represents the sequence `a` of positions to be removed.
- `q_wali_list` represents the different numbers of players `n_i` for which we need to find the number of winners.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game process for a single value of `n_i` (denoted as `b` in the function).
- According to the problem statement, in each round, players at positions specified by `a` are removed from the lineup. If there are fewer players than the position specified, that position is skipped.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of remaining players after all possible removals have been made.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect:
- The function simply checks if `a` (the first element of `k_wali_list`) is less than or equal to `b`. If true, it returns `a - 1`; otherwise, it returns `b`.
- This logic does not simulate the game process at all. It does not account for multiple rounds of removal, nor does it handle the sequence `a` properly.

#### Expected Behavior:
- For each `n_i` in `q_wali_list`, the function should simulate the game process:
  1. Start with `n_i` players.
  2. In each round, remove players at positions specified by `a` (if they exist).
  3. Repeat until no more players can be removed.
  4. Return the count of remaining players.

#### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the game rules as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
