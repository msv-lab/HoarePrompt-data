The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100, and `b`, a list of `q` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, the function returns a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
