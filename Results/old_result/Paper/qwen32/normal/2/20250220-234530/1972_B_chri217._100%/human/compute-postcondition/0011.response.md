The code snippet reads a new positive integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. This means the value of `n` changes from its initial state to the newly read integer. The values of `t`, `s`, and `cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the new string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**.

Natural Language: The value of `n` has been updated to a new positive integer read from the input, while `t`, `s`, and `cases` retain their original values.
