Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer read from input representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of coins in each test case such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down, `cases` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    cases.append((n, s))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the new string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the new string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing three tuples, the first being the original tuple, the second being the original `(n, s)`, and the third being the newly appended `(n, s)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
