The code snippet reads a new line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `s`. This means the original value of `s` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is an empty list**.
