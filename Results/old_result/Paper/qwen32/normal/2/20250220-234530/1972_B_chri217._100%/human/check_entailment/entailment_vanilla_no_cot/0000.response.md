To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the input string `s`.

### Analysis:

1. **Game Rules Recap:**
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - If the number of `'U'` coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the number of `'U'` coins is even, Bob will always win because Alice will eventually be forced into a losing position.

3. **Implementation Check:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly counts the number of `'U'` coins using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - It then checks if this count is odd or even using the modulo operator `%`.
   - If the count is odd (`ups % 2` evaluates to `True`), it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count is even (`ups % 2` evaluates to `False`), it returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob wins.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in `func_2` aligns with the key insight derived from the game rules.
   - Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner based on the input.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
