The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since `t` is decreased by 1 in each iteration, the value of `t` at the start of the next iteration should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 (before it was decreased).

Given that `t` is decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if we denote the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration as `t_end`, then at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t_end + 1`.

However, since we know that `t` is decreased by 1 at the end of the iteration, the value of `t` at the start of the current iteration (which is the end of the previous one) must have been 1 more than its current value. Therefore, if `t` is currently 0 (meaning the loop just finished), it must have been 1 at the start of this iteration. If `t` is currently 1, it must have been 2 at the start of this iteration, and so on.

So, if `t` is currently some value `x` at the end of the iteration, it must have been `x + 1` at the start of the iteration.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration other than it being decreased by 1, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, we adjust `t` to be 1 more than its current value (which is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration before being decreased by 1).

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the new string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**
