The code snippet counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' within the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string input from the user; `m` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.**
