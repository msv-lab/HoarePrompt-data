The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `m`, `p`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed
- `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`
- `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer the user inputs. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
