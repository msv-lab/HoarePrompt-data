The code snippet `p = s.count('pie')` counts the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `p`.

Given that `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, and `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, the value of `p` will be the count of 'pie' in the modified string `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
