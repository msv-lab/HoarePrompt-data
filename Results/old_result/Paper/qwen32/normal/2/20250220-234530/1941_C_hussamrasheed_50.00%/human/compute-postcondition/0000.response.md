Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to an integer value read from the input, while the conditions for `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are described in the problem statement and have not yet been modified by the code snippet provided.
