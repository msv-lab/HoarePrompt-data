The code snippet `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This affects the value of `s` and potentially the value of `m` since `m` is defined as the number of times 'map' appeared in `s`.

Given the initial state, after executing the code:
- `s` will no longer contain any 'map' substrings.
- `m` will be 0 because all 'map' substrings have been removed from `s`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new input string with all 'map' substrings removed; `m` is 0; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
