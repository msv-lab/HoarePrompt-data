Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 15. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is incremented by the smaller of `n // 15` and `m // 10`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The values of `x`, `n`, and the condition regarding `cnt` remain unchanged.
