To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, we need to focus on how the value of `cnt` changes based on the initial conditions.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` must be at least 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Let's substitute the known values of `x` and `y` into the expression:
- `x + y` equals `1 + 2` which is `3`.
- `(x + y) * x` equals `3 * 1` which is `3`.
- `(x + y) * y` equals `3 * 2` which is `6`.

So the expression becomes:
```python
cnt += min(n // 3, m // 6)
```

This means `cnt` will be incremented by the minimum of `n // 3` and `m // 6`.

Since `n` is at least 3, `n // 3` will be at least 1.
Since `m` is at least 6, `m // 6` will be at least 1.

The exact values of `n // 3` and `m // 6` depend on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but we know they are both integers and at least 1.

Therefore, `cnt` will be incremented by at least 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6)`**.
