To determine the new state after the given code executes, let's analyze the changes:

Given:
- `n` must be at least 4
- `m` must be at least 12
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1
- `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6)`

The line of code to execute is:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, calculate the expressions inside the `min` function:
- `(x + y) * x` evaluates to `(1 + 3) * 1` which is `4`.
- `(x + y) * y` evaluates to `(1 + 3) * 3` which is `12`.

Next, calculate the divisions:
- `n // 4`: Since `n` is at least 4, the minimum value for `n // 4` is `1` (if `n` is exactly 4).
- `m // 12`: Since `m` is at least 12, the minimum value for `m // 12` is `1` (if `m` is exactly 12).

Therefore, `min(n // 4, m // 12)` will be at least `1`.

Thus, `cnt` is increased by at least `1`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6) + min(n // 4, m // 12)`**.

This means `cnt` is increased by the sum of two minimum values, both of which are at least 1.
