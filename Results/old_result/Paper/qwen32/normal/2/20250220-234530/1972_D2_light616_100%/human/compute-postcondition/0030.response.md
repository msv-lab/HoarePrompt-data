The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given that `y` was initially 2, it is now 3. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, `y_final`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 9, `m` is at least 9, `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by at least 1.**
