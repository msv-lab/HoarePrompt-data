### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

##### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` (count of valid pairs) to 0.
2. **Outer Loop**: Iterates through possible values of `x` from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
3. **Inner Loop**: For each `x`, iterates through possible values of `y` starting from 1, checking if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
4. **Condition Check**: Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
5. **Output**: Prints the count of valid pairs.

##### Function `func_2`:
Reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Range of `x` and `y`**: The loops iterate over `x` and `y` but do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges. Specifically, the condition \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\) severely restricts the pairs considered.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` only considers coprime pairs, which is too restrictive. The problem does not require \(a\) and \(b\) to be coprime.
3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The counting mechanism does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
The annotations confirm the behavior of the program:
- The outer loop runs until \(x \cdot x > n\), which means it only considers small values of `x`.
- The inner loop checks pairs \((x, y)\) under the condition \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\), which is too restrictive.
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` further restricts the pairs to coprime ones, which is not required by the problem.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. It fails to consider all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and incorrectly restricts the pairs to coprime ones.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
