The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not retain its value between iterations and is not used within the loop body, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` represents the number of remaining iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Given that `func_1()` has already been called, we do not need to adjust its state as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `0 <= t <= 10^4` (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `func_1()` has been called.**
