To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `x` is defined as `x_final`, which is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- `y` is the last value checked in the inner loop for the previous `x`.
- `cnt` is defined as `cnt_final`, which is the sum of all valid `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.

Given this information, `cnt` holds the final computed sum based on the specified conditions and calculations. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and the pairs `(x, y)` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

The `print(cnt)` statement will output the final computed value of `cnt`, which is the sum of all valid `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of all valid min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs (x, y) where gcd(x, y) == 1)**
