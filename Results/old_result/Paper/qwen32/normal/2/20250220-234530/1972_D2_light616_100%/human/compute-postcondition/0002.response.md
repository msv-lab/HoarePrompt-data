To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables or introduce new ones.

However, assuming `func_1()` does not modify the variable `t` or introduce any new variables that affect the given initial state, the output state would simply reflect that `func_1()` was called, and no changes were made to `t`.

Given this assumption, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`; `func_1()` has been called.**
