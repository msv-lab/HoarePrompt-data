Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens needed. Specifically, the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect and does not properly account for the placement of icons on the grid.

Let's break down the logic that should be used:

1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells. Since each screen is 5x3 (15 cells), we need to determine how many 2x2 icons can fit on a single screen. The maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a single screen is 2 (as placing 3 would require 12 cells, leaving only 3 cells which cannot form another 2x2 icon).

2. **1x1 Icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, we need to place the remaining 1x1 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and after placing 2 2x2 icons (which take up 8 cells), we have 7 cells left. If we place only 1 2x2 icon (which takes up 4 cells), we have 11 cells left.

Given these points, the correct approach would be:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons.
- Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Determine the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def main():
    ap = int(input())
    for _ in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        remaining_cells_after_2x2 = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4
        
        # Calculate remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_1x1 = x - (screens_for_2x2 * 15 - remaining_cells_after_2x2)
        if remaining_1x1 < 0:
            remaining_1x1 = 0
        
        # Calculate screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)

main()
```

This corrected code should provide the correct number of screens needed for any given combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
