Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input. Regardless of whether `x > 0 and y == 0` is true or false, the values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except that `k` is incremented by 1.**
