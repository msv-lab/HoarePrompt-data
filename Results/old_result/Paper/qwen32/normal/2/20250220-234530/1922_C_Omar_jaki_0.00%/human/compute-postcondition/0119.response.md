Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the positions of the cities in increasing order, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the indices of two different cities. The function returns the index of the closest city to the midpoint of the cities at indices `x_i` and `y_i` for each query.**
