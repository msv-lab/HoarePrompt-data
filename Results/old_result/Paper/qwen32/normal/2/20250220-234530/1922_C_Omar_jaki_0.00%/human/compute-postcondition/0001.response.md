The code snippet assigns the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `r()` to the variable `t`. This means `t` will now hold the value of the first integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps integers from input.**
