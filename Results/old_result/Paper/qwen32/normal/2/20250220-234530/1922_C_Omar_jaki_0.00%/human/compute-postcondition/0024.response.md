To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step-by-step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **List `b`**: The list `b` is structured as `[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., vk]`. This means the first two elements are `0`, followed by a series of values `v1, v2, ..., vk`.
- **Variable `u`**: It is described as a truthy value that has been decremented by 1. Since it's a truthy value, it was initially non-zero, but after decrementing, its exact value is not specified.
- **Variables `c` and `d`**: These are values returned by a function `r()`. We know that `c < d`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

Let's analyze the indices being accessed in the list `b`:
- **Index `(d - 1) * 2`**:
  - Since `d` is a value returned by `r()` and `c < d`, `d` must be at least 2 (because `c` starts from 1 at minimum).
  - Therefore, `(d - 1) * 2` will be an even number starting from 2 (when `d = 2`), 4 (when `d = 3`), and so on.
  - Given the structure of `b`, this index will point to one of the values `v1, v2, ..., vk` because the first two elements are `0`.

- **Index `(c - 1) * 2`**:
  - Similarly, since `c` is a value returned by `r()` and `c < d`, `c` must be at least 1.
  - Therefore, `(c - 1) * 2` will be an even number starting from 0 (when `c = 1`), 2 (when `c = 2`), and so on.
  - Given the structure of `b`, this index will point to either `0` (when `c = 1`) or one of the values `v1, v2, ..., vk` (when `c > 1`).

### Calculation:
- If `c = 1`, then `b[(c - 1) * 2]` is `b[0]`, which is `0`.
- If `c > 1`, then `b[(c - 1) * 2]` is `b[(c - 1) * 2]`, which is one of the values `v1, v2, ..., vk`.

- For `d`, `b[(d - 1) * 2]` is always one of the values `v1, v2, ..., vk`.

### Conclusion:
- If `c = 1`, the expression simplifies to `b[(d - 1) * 2] - 0`, which is simply `b[(d - 1) * 2]`.
- If `c > 1`, the expression is `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`, where both indices point to values within `v1, v2, ..., vk`.

Given the above analysis, the output depends on the specific values of `c` and `d`, but we can describe it precisely:

Output: **`b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` (where `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]` are elements from the list `b` corresponding to the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` respectively)**
