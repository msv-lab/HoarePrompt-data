The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `dic`. None of the other variables (`t`, `times`, `check`, `n`, `data`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers from the input, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**
