Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is `k` (which means `k` is a variable with some unknown value).
- `costs` is `[1-k, 1]`.
- `h` is `n-k+1`, which simplifies to `0-k+1` or `1-k`.
- It is also mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly `2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
