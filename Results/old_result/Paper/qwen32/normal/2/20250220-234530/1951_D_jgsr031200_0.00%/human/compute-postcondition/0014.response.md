Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `h + curr`; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is a defined positive integer.** 

In natural language, the value of `h` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
