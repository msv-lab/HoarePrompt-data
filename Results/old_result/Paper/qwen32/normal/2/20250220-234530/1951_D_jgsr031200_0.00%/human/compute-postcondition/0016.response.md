In this task, the loop iterates over the elements of the `costs` list. The loop head only involves the variable `i`, which takes on the values from the `costs` list during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `h + curr`.
- `curr` is `n // i`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since the loop iterates over the `costs` list, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the first element in the `costs` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should take the value of the next element in the `costs` list.

Initially, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`. If the previous iteration used the first element (`n - k + 1`), then the next iteration should use the second element (`1`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1`.

State: **`n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `h + curr`, `curr` is `n // i`, `i` is `1`**
