### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions and constructing a solution based on those conditions. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the program:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing "YES", `1`, and `1`. This is because if Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants, she can buy exactly one jewel for one coin.

2. **Insufficient Coins**: The program correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO". This is because if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants, it's impossible for her to buy the required number of jewels.

3. **General Case**: For the general case where `n > k`, the program tries to construct a solution using two prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`. However, this approach is flawed:
   - The program calculates `curr` as `n // i` for each price `i` in `costs`.
   - It then adds `curr` to `h` and subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.
   - After processing both prices, it checks if `h` (the total number of jewels bought) is less than `k`. If it is, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the prices `1-k` and `1`.

   There are several issues with this approach:
   - The price `1-k` is invalid because prices must be positive integers.
   - The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is incorrect. The program should aim to find a combination of up to 60 prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding her budget of `n` coins.
   - The current implementation does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the chosen prices.

### Conclusion:
Given the flaws in the logic for the general case, the program is not correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
