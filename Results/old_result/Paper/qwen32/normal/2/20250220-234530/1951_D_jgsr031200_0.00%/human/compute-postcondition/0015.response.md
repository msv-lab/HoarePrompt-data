The code snippet `n -= i * curr` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `i` and `curr` from it. Given that `curr` is defined as `n // i`, the expression `i * curr` essentially computes the largest multiple of `i` that is less than or equal to `n`. After this operation, `n` will be reduced by this multiple.

Since `n` is initially a positive integer and `curr` is calculated as `n // i`, the new value of `n` will be the remainder when `n` is divided by `i`.

Output State: **`n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `h + curr`, `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is a defined positive integer.**
