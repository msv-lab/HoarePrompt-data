Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), \(n \neq k\), and the current value of `n` is less than `k`, we need to determine the output of the following Python code snippet:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.
- There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the values of `n` or `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the specific values of `n` and `k` as long as they satisfy the given constraints.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
