To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: This is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
2. **`n`**: This is another input integer.
3. **`a`**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. **`max`**: This is the maximum value of the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `max` is described as "the maximum value of the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a`". 
- To find this value, you would need to iterate through the list `a` and find the minimum of each consecutive pair of elements. After finding these minimums, you would then determine the maximum of these minimum values.

However, since the specific values of `n`, `a`, and the resulting `max` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `max` in terms of the given conditions.

### Output Description:
The `print(max)` statement will output the maximum value of the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a`.

Output: **max (where max is the maximum value of the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a`)**
