Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the current input, `i` is 3. If `min(a[3], a[2])` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to `min(a[3], a[2])`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
