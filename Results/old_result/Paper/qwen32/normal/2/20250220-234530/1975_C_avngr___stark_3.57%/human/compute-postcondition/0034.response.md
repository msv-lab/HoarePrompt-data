The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from its previous state (which was the length of the list `a`) to the newly input integer.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the list of integers, `max` is the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`, and `_` is now the next iteration index (previously finished iteration index + 1).**
