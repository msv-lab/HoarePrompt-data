Postcondition: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, and `_` is now the next iteration index (previously finished iteration index + 1). If `min(a[i], a[i - 1])` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to `min(a[i], a[i - 1])`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
