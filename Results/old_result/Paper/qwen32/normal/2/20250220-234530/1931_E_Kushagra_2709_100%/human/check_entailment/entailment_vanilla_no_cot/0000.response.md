To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `zerocnts` functions correctly solves the problem described.

### Analysis:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to determine the winner of the game between Anna and Sasha, given the rules of the game and the initial list of numbers.

2. **Game Rules Recap**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen numbers.
   - The game ends when only one number remains in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Anna's move reduces the length of the number by removing trailing zeros.
   - Sasha's move increases the length of the list by combining two numbers.
   - The key observation is that Sasha can always combine numbers to form a large number, but Anna can reduce the size of numbers by removing trailing zeros.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - `zerocnts(num)`: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - `func_1(n, m, nums)`: This function calculates the total length of the numbers after Anna's optimal moves and determines the winner based on the remaining length compared to \(m + 1\).

5. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`: This calculates the total length of all numbers in the list.
   - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`: This creates a list of trailing zero counts for each number, sorted in descending order.
   - `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`: This loop subtracts the trailing zeros from the total length, considering Anna's optimal strategy to remove the maximum possible trailing zeros.
   - `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`: This checks if the remaining length is sufficient for Sasha to win.

### Evaluation:

- The logic seems to assume that Anna will always remove the maximum possible trailing zeros in her turns, and Sasha will always concatenate numbers to maximize the length.
- The condition `tot >= m + 1` is used to determine if Sasha can achieve a number with at least \(10^m\) digits, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
