The code snippet increments the value of `tot` by 1. The other variables (`num`, `i`) remain unchanged unless the condition in the most internal loop or if statement is met, which would break out of the loop or if statement. However, the given code does not include that condition, so we only consider the increment of `tot`.

Given that `tot` was initially 2, after executing `tot += 1`, `tot` becomes 3.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 3, and `i` is `k - 2`.**
