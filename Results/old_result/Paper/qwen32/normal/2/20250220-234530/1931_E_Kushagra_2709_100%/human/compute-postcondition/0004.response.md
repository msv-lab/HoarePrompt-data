Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9, `tot` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `num` and `tot` remain unchanged. The condition that the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0' is still valid. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
