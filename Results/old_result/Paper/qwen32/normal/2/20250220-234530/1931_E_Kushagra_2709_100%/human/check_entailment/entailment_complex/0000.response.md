### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and the behavior of the functions involved.

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - **Anna's Move:** Reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing leading zeros.
   - **Sasha's Move:** Concatenates two numbers in any order and inserts the result back into the list.
   - **Game End Condition:** When there is only one number left in the list.
   - **Winning Condition:** Sasha wins if the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Anna's move reduces the number of digits in the worst case (when reversing a number like 1000 to 1).
   - Sasha's move increases the number of digits by combining two numbers.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, meaning there is only one number left.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The critical factor is the total number of digits in the list after Anna's moves.
   - If the total number of digits (after accounting for Anna's moves) is at least \(m+1\), Sasha can potentially form a number \(\geq 10^m\).
   - Anna's optimal strategy is to minimize the number of digits, while Sasha aims to maximize it.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - **`func_1` Function:**
     - Calculates the total number of digits in all numbers (`tot`).
     - Sorts the numbers based on the count of trailing zeros in descending order.
     - Subtracts the count of trailing zeros from `tot` for every other number (starting from the highest).
     - Returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted `tot` is \(\geq m+1\); otherwise, 'Anna'.
   - **`zerocnts` Function:**
     - Counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

5. **Verification Against Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases align with the expected outcomes based on the described logic.
   - For example, in the first test case, Anna can reverse either number, but Sasha can always form a number \(\geq 10^2\) regardless, leading to a win for Sasha.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the described game mechanics and optimal strategies. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
