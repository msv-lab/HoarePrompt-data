You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1'; the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid; the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1').
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: t is the initial input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), i is t-1, n is the input integer for the last test case, a is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string s of the last test case contains exactly one '1', otherwise a is 0, b is 'SQUARE' if any string s of the last test case contains more than one '1', otherwise b is '', and j is n-1. The final printed output is 'TRIANGLE' if a is not 0, otherwise it is 'SQUARE'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an `n × n` grid of strings. Each string in the grid consists of `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of all the '1's, and the size of this shape is greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
