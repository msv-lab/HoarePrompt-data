`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` will now hold the integer value provided by the user input. The constraints for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) remain valid. The other variables (`n`, `grid`) and their conditions are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1'; the `grid` contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid; the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1').**
