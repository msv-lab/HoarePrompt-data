### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine whether the '1's in the grid form a triangle or a square. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not correctly identify the shapes based on the given definitions.

Here are the issues with the current implementation:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program incorrectly identifies a triangle if any row contains exactly one '1'. According to the problem statement, a triangle must have rows with an increasing (or decreasing) odd number of '1's centered around a middle column. The current code does not check for this pattern.

2. **Square Detection**: The program identifies a square if any row contains more than one '1'. This is also incorrect because a square requires every row to have the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be aligned in a way that forms a square.

3. **Logic Flow**: The program only checks the conditions for one row per test case and does not consider the entire grid. It should iterate through the entire grid to ensure that all '1's fit the criteria for either a triangle or a square.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether the '1's form a triangle or a square. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, one would need to implement logic that checks for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square across the entire grid.
