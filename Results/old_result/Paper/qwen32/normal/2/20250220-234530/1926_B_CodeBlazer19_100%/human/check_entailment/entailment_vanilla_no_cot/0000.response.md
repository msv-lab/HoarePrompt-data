Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape formed by the `1`s in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are some issues with the code:

1. The variable `a` is initialized to `0` and then set to `'TRIANGLE'` if any row contains exactly one `1`. However, this does not correctly identify a triangle because a triangle can have more than one row with exactly one `1` (in the case of an upside-down triangle), and it can also have rows with more than one `1`.

2. The variable `b` is set to `'SQUARE'` if any row contains more than one `1`. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square because a square requires all rows to have the same number of `1`s, and these `1`s must be aligned in a specific way.

3. The program does not check the alignment of the `1`s within the rows to confirm if they form a triangle or a square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Check if all rows with `1`s have the same number of `1`s to potentially identify a square.
- Verify that the `1`s are aligned in a square pattern.
- Check if the `1`s form a triangle pattern by verifying the number of `1`s in each row increases or decreases by 2 consecutively and are centered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    def is_square(grid, n):
        count_ones = [row.count('1') for row in grid]
        non_zero_counts = [x for x in count_ones if x > 0]
        return len(set(non_zero_counts)) == 1 and non_zero_counts[0] > 1

    def is_triangle(grid, n):
        count_ones = [row.count('1') for row in grid]
        non_zero_counts = [x for x in count_ones if x > 0]
        if len(non_zero_counts) < 2:
            return False
        increasing = all(non_zero_counts[i] + 2 == non_zero_counts[i+1] for i in range(len(non_zero_counts)-1))
        decreasing = all(non_zero_counts[i] - 2 == non_zero_counts[i+1] for i in range(len(non_zero_counts)-1))
        return (increasing or decreasing) and non_zero_counts[0] > 1

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This should never happen based on problem constraints

func()
```

This program checks for both square and triangle patterns by counting the number of `1`s in each row and verifying the required properties for each shape.
