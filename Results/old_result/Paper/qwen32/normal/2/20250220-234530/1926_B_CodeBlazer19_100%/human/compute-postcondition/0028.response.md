Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' because at least one input string `s` contains exactly one '1'.
- `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if at least one input string `s` contains more than one '1'; otherwise, it is an empty string.
- `j` is set to `n-1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(a)
```

From the initial state, we know that `a` is explicitly set to 'TRIANGLE'. Therefore, the `print(a)` statement will output the value of `a`.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
