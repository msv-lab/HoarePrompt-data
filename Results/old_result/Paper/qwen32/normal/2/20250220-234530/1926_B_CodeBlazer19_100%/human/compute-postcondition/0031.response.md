Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if at least one input string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if at least one input string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, and `j` is `n-1`.**
