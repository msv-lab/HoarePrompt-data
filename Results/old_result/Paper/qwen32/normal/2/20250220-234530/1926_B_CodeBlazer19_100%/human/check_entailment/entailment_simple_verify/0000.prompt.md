You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error in Identifying Shapes**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle, and if any row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this logic is flawed because:
   - A square can have multiple rows with more than one '1', but it doesn't necessarily mean that a single row with more than one '1' implies a square.
   - A triangle can have multiple rows with different counts of '1's, but the program only checks for the presence of a single '1' in any row to conclude it's a triangle.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle various configurations of triangles and squares correctly. For example:
   - Consider a triangle with '1's in the following pattern:
     ```
     001
     011
     111
     ```
     The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because it sees multiple rows with more than one '1'.
   - Consider a square with '1's in the following pattern:
     ```
     000
     010
     010
     ```
     The program would incorrectly identify this as a triangle because it sees a row with exactly one '1'.

3. **Misuse of Variables**: The variables `a` and `b` are used to store the result, but they are not initialized properly. The variable `a` is initially set to `0`, and then it is set to the string `'TRIANGLE'`. This misuse of variables can lead to unexpected behavior.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to properly analyze the structure of the '1's in the grid to determine if they form a triangle or a square according to the given definitions. This involves checking the alignment and count of '1's in each row to match the specific patterns of triangles and squares.
