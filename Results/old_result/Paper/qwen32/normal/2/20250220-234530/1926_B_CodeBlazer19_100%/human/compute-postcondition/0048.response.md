The code snippet assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. This assignment overrides any previous value `b` might have had, including the conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 0 if `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 1.**
