### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately identifies several critical flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Triangle Identification**:
   - The program incorrectly identifies a triangle if any row has exactly one `1`. According to the problem description, a triangle must have `2*i - 1` ones in the `i-th` row, centered around a vertical axis. The program does not check for this specific pattern or alignment.
   - Additionally, the program does not account for upside-down triangles, which are also valid triangles according to the problem statement.

2. **Square Identification**:
   - The program identifies a square if any row has more than one `1`. However, this is insufficient to confirm that the `1`s form a square. A square requires that all rows containing `1`s have the same number of `1`s, starting from the same column.
   - The program does not verify that the `1`s are aligned consistently across multiple rows, which is essential for identifying a square.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The variables `a` and `b` are used to store the type of shape, but the logic for setting these variables is flawed. Setting `a` to `'TRIANGLE'` when a row has exactly one `1` is incorrect, as explained above.
   - The decision-making process after processing all rows is also flawed. The program prints `'TRIANGLE'` if `a` is not `0`, which can happen even if the grid does not actually contain a triangle. Similarly, it prints `'SQUARE'` if `b` is set, without verifying the full conditions for a square.

### Correct Implementation Considerations:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Check each row to see if it fits the pattern of a triangle (i.e., `2*i - 1` ones centered around a vertical axis).
- Ensure that the `1`s form a consistent pattern across multiple rows to identify a square.
- Handle both upright and upside-down triangles.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the fact that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to distinguish between a triangle and a square, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
