Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is the new user's input, `j` is 3. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is `'TRIANGLE'` and `b` is `''`. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `'SQUARE'`. If `s` does not contain any '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `''`.**
