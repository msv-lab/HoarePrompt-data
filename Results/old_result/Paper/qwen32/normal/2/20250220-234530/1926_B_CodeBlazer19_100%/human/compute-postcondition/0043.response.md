Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string provided by user input, and the string `s` does not contain exactly one '1'. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to `'SQUARE'`. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.**
