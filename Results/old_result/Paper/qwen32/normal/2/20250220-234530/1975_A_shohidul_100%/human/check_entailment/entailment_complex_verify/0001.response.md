### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. The operations can be performed any number of times.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Already Sorted**: If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the answer is "Yes".
2. **Split and Swap**: For the array to be sortable by splitting and swapping, there must exist a point where the array can be split such that:
   - The first part (prefix) is greater than or equal to the first element of the second part (suffix).
   - The second part (suffix) is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Additionally, the last element of the prefix should be less than or equal to the first element of the suffix.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the provided code and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Check if Already Sorted**:
   - The code checks if the entire array is already sorted using `check_all`. If true, it prints "YES".
   
2. **Finding the Split Point**:
   - If the array is not sorted, the code iterates through the array to find the first point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - Once found, it considers the suffix starting from index `i` (`new = a[i:]`).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Whether the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix.
     - `new_all`: Whether the suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Multiple "NO" Outputs**: The current implementation might print "NO" multiple times if there are multiple points where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, which is incorrect.
- **Logic Flaw**: The condition `check_all_new` is not sufficient. It only checks if the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix, but it doesn't ensure that the entire prefix (before the split point) is greater than or equal to the suffix.
- **Single Check**: The program should only print "NO" once after checking all possible split points, not immediately after finding one invalid split point.

#### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations confirm the logic flow but do not address the logical flaws in the conditions checked. Specifically, the annotations do not highlight the issue with `check_all_new` and the need to ensure the entire prefix is greater than or equal to the suffix.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program needs to be corrected to properly check all possible split points and ensure the entire prefix is greater than or equal to the suffix.
