The code snippet calculates whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and assigns the result to the variable `new_all`. 

Given the initial state, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. The code uses a list comprehension within the `all()` function to check if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element. This essentially checks if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The variable `new_all` is now a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
