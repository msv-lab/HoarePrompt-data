The given code snippet checks if each element in the sublist `new` is less than or equal to the next element in `new`. This is done using a list comprehension combined with the `all()` function, which returns `True` only if all elements in the iterable (in this case, the list comprehension) are `True`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`

The line of code:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```
will set `new_all` to `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise it will set `new_all` to `False`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, and `check_all_new`) are not modified by this line of code, they retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**
