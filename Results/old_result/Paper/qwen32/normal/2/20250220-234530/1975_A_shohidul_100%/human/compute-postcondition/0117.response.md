The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
