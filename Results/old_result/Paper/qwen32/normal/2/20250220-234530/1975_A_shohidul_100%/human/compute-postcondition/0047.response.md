The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is mentioned to be greater than 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `n` is described as an input integer, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. The variable `a` is described as a list of integers obtained from the input, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
4. The variable `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

Since none of the variables affect the `print` statement, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
