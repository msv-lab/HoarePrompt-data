The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but none of these directly influence the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is static and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is set to `False`.
- `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end.
- Either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

None of these conditions or variable definitions change the fact that the `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
