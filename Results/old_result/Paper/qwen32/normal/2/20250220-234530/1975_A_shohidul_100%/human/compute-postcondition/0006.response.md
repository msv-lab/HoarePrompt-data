The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides context about variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all`, but these do not influence the execution of the `print` statement directly since it does not reference any of these variables.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and its current value is `True`.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
