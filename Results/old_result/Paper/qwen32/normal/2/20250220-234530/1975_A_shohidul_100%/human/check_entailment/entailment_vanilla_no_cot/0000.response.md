Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be split and rearranged to be sorted is flawed. The program only checks if the array can be split at the first point where it is not sorted and then verifies if the resulting parts can be rearranged to form a sorted array, but this is not sufficient for all cases.

To correctly solve the problem, one should find the longest non-decreasing prefix and the longest non-decreasing suffix, and then check if the elements between these two parts can be rearranged to fit between them without violating the non-decreasing order. The current implementation does not account for this more complex requirement.
