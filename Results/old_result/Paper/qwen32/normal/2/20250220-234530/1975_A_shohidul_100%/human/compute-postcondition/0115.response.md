Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'YES'` without referencing any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
