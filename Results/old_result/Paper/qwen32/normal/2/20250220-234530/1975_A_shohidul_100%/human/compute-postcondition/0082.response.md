Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True, the program continues with the existing state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all`. If `check_all` is False, `i` is set to the value of `n`.**
