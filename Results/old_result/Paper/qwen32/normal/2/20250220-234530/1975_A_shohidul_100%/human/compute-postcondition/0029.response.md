Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is True if each element in `new` is greater than or equal to the preceding element, otherwise `new_all` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.**
