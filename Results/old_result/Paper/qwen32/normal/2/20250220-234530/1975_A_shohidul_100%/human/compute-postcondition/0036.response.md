The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all` are modified by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; otherwise, `check_all_new` is False, `new_all` is True if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element in `new`; otherwise, `new_all` is False.**
