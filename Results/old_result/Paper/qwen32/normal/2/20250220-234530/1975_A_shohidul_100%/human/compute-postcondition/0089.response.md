Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. At the current index `i`, the element `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.**
