Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is False.
- `i` is 2.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is False.
- `new_all` is True if each element in `new` is greater than or equal to the preceding element, otherwise `new_all` is False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
