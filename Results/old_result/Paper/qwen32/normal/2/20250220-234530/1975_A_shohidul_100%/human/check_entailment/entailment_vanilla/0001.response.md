Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine if the array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap them.

### Key Observations:
1. **Already Sorted**: If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the answer is trivially "Yes".
2. **Split and Swap**: For the array to be sortable by splitting and swapping, there must exist a point where the array can be split such that:
   - The first part (prefix) is greater than or equal to the first element of the second part (suffix).
   - The second part (suffix) is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the provided code and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Check if Already Sorted**:
   - The code checks if the entire array is already sorted using `check_all`. If true, it prints "YES".
   
2. **Finding the Split Point**:
   - If the array is not sorted, the code iterates through the array to find the first point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - Once found, it considers the suffix starting from index `i` (`new = a[i:]`).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Whether the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix.
     - `new_all`: Whether the suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Multiple "NO" Outputs**: The current implementation might print "NO" multiple times if there are multiple points where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, which is incorrect.
- **Logic Flaw**: The condition `check_all_new` is not sufficient. It only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix, but it doesn't ensure that the entire prefix (before the split point) is greater than or equal to the suffix.
- **Single Check**: The program should only print "NO" once after checking all possible split points, not immediately after finding one invalid split point.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, we would need to ensure that we check all possible split points and verify that the entire prefix is greater than or equal to the suffix, not just the first element of the prefix.
