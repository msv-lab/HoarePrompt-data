Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; at index `i`, the element `a[i-1]` is greater than the element `a[i]`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is False; either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False (or both) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or if statement. Therefore, all the preconditions and variable states remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
