Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` contains either two additional elements `'yes', 'no'` or `'no', 'no'` or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'` if `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains either three additional elements `'yes', 'no', 'no'` or `'no', 'no', 'no'` or four strings `'no', 'no', 'yes', 'no'`. Otherwise, `results` contains two additional elements `'yes', 'no'` or `'no', 'no'`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `results` list now contains an additional element `'no'`, regardless of its previous contents. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
