The code appends the string `'yes'` to the `results` list. This affects the `results` list by adding one more element to it. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` is a list that now contains one additional element `'yes'`. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` originally contained two strings, the first being `'no'` and the second being `'no'`, and now contains three elements: `'no'`, `'no'`, and `'yes'`. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged except for the addition of `'yes'`.**
