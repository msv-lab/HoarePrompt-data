The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. The initial state specifies that `results` already contains a single element, which is either `'no'`, `'yes'`, or `'no'` based on certain conditions related to the string `arr`. After appending `'no'`, the `results` list will now contain two elements, with the second element being `'no'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` is a list containing two strings, the first being either `'no'`, `'yes'`, or `'no'`, and the second being `'no'`.**
