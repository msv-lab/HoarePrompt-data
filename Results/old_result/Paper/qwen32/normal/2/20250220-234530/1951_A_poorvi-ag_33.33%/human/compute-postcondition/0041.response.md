Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations.
- `i` is equal to `t` after the loop.
- `results` is a list with at least `t+1` elements.
- `r` is the `(t+1)`th element in `results`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `r` is explicitly stated to be the `(t+1)`th element in the list `results`.
- Since lists in Python are zero-indexed, the `(t+1)`th element corresponds to the index `t` in the list `results`.
- Therefore, `r = results[t]`.

### Output:
The code prints the value of `r`, which is the element at index `t` in the list `results`.

Given the information, the precise description of what will be printed is:
Output: **r (where r is the (t+1)th element in the list `results`)**

However, to match the format exactly as requested:
Output: **r (where r is the element at index t in the list `results`)**
