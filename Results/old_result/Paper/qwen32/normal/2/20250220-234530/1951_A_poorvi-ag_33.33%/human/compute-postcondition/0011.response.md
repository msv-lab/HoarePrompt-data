Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is the string input from the user. The number of '1's in `arr` is even. `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, or it contains an even number of '1's but does not have '11' as a substring. `results` remains an empty list.**
