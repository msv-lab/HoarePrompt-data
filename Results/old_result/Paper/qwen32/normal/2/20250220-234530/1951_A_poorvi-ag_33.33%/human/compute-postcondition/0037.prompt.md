Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
        results.append('no')
    if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is the string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the string `'yes'`. If the number of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, and `arr` is the new string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains either two strings `'no', 'no'` or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'` depending on whether the `if` condition was true and an additional `'yes'` was appended. Otherwise, `results` contains one additional element `'yes'` if the `if` condition was true, or one additional string `'no'` if the `else` part was executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, and `arr` is the new string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains either two additional elements `'yes', 'no'` or `'no', 'no'` or `'no', 'yes'` or `'no', 'no', 'no'` or `'no', 'no', 'yes'` or `'no', 'yes', 'no'` or `'no', 'no', 'yes', 'no'` or `'no', 'no', 'no', 'no'` or `'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no'`. Otherwise, `results` contains one additional element `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the `if` condition, or two strings `'no', 'no'` or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'`. If `arr.count('1') % 2 == 0`, `results` may contain additional elements as specified in the if part. If `arr.count('1') % 2 != 0`, `results` contains either two additional elements `'yes', 'no'` or `'no', 'no'` or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'` and includes another `'yes'` at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
