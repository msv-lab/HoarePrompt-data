The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` changes based on the user's input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, and `arr` is the string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the string `'yes'`. If the number of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`.**
