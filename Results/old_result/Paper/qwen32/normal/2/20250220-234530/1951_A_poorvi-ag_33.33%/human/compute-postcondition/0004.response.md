`arr` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `arr` now holds the string input from the user. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user.**
