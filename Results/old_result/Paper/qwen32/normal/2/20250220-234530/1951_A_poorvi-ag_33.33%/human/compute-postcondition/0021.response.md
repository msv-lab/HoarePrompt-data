Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` is a list. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains two strings, the first being `'no'` and the second being `'no'`. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.**
