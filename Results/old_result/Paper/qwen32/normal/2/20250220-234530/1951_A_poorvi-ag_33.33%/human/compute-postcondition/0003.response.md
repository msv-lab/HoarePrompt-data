Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**
In natural language: The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. A new variable `n` is introduced and assigned the value of an input integer.
