To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider how the loop modifies the variables based on the given code snippet.

The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the `results` list. After the loop completes, the variable `i` will be equal to `t`, which represents the total number of iterations.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until it has processed all elements in the `results` list. Therefore, after all iterations are complete:

- `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `t` remains the same as it represents the total number of iterations.
- `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes executing.
- `results` will still be the same list, but all its elements will have been printed.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations; `i` is equal to `t` after the loop; `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being either `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration. All elements in `results` have been printed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will match `t`, indicating all iterations have completed, and all elements in the `results` list will have been printed.
