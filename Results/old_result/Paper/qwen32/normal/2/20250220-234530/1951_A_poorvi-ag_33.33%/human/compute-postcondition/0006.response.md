The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user, and `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring.**
