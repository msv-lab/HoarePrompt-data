The code snippet appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Given the initial conditions, `results` was either an empty list or contained the string `'no'` if `arr` had exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring. After appending `'no'`, `results` will definitely contain the string `'no'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user and contains an odd number of '1's, and `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`.**
