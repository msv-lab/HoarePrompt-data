The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is the string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`. If the number of '1's in `arr` is even and `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the string `'yes'`. If the number of '1's in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`.**
