Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 1. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. If `u` equals 0, `a` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of groups of elements where `op` became 0, and `op` is the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `u` is not equal to 0, `v` (the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`) determines the state: if `v` is odd, `v % 2` is not equal to 0; if `v` is even and non-zero, `a` is a non-empty list, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)`, and `op` is 0 or 1 depending on the last element processed, where `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution; if `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1.**
