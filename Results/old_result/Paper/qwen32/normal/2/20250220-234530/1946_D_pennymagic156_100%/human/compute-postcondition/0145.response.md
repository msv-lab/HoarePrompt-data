The given Python code snippet initializes two variables, `op` and `cnt`, both to 0. This operation does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. Additionally, `v % 2` is equal to 0. The current value of `v` is non-zero. `op` is 0. `cnt` is 0.**
