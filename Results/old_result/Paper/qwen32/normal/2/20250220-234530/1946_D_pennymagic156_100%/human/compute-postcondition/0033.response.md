The code snippet provided swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Initially, `a` holds the value returned by `func_1()` and `t` contains elements from `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. After the swap, `a` will now hold the list `t`, and `t` will be reset to an empty list.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is [], `ans` is -1, `i` has completed its iterations from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and varies with each iteration, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and varies with each iteration, `op` and `ai` are determined by the XOR operations within the loop.**
