Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `val` is the third element in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
