The given Python code snippet initializes two variables `op` and `ai` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, or `v`. The only changes are the assignments to `op` and `ai`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `u == v == 0`, the state remains unchanged. `op` is 0. `ai` is 0.**
