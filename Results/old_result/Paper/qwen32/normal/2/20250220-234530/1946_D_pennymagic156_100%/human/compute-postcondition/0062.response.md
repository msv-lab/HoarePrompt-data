The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, or `v` will be changed by this statement.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.**
