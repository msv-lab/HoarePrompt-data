Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `u == v == 0`, the state remains unchanged. `op` is 0. `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, and `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0 and now also contains the new `ai` if `op` was 0, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op`, `ai` is 0 if `op` was 0, `val` is the second element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least three elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` was 0 and now also contains the new `ai`, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op` XORed with the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0 if `op` was 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `val` is the third element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
