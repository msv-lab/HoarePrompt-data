The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `ai`. This change does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0 and now also contains the new `ai`, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op`, `ai` is 0, `val` is the second element in `a`.**
