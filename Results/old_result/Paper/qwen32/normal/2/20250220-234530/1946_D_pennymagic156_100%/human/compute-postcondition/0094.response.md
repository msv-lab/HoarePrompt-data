The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here's the breakdown:

- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`, effectively extracting the least significant bit (LSB) of the shifted value.
- `^=` performs an in-place XOR operation between `op` and the extracted bit.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `op`. Since the exact values of `val` and `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `op`, but we can express it in terms of the original `op` and the extracted bit from `val`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `cnt` is 0**.
