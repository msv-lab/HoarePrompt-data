To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's break down the operation:

The line of code is:
```python
op ^= val >> i & 1
```

Here's what happens:
- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` performs a bitwise AND with 1, which extracts the least significant bit (LSB) of the result from the right shift operation.
- `^=` performs an in-place XOR operation between `op` and the extracted bit.

Given the initial state:
- `op` is 0.
- `val` is the second element in the list `a`.
- `i` is iterating from 29 down to 0, but since `u` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) is currently 0, `i` must be such that the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, so we'll consider the general case.
- `val` is a specific value, but its exact binary representation is not provided, so we'll denote the `i`-th bit of `val` as `bit_val_i`.

Let's denote the `i`-th bit of `val` as `bit_val_i`. The operation `val >> i & 1` will yield `bit_val_i`.

Thus, `op ^= bit_val_i` means `op` will be updated to `op XOR bit_val_i`. Since `op` is initially 0, the new value of `op` will simply be `bit_val_i`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `[val]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0, `val` is the second element in the list `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `op` is now the `i`-th bit of `val`. All other variables remain unchanged.
