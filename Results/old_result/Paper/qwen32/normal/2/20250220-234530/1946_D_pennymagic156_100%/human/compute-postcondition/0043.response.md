The code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is 0, `cnt` is 1.**
