The code appends `ai` to the list `t`. Given the initial state, `ai` is `val` if `op` is 0. Since no changes are made to `n`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, or `val`, those remain unchanged. The only change is that `t` now includes the new element `ai`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0 and now also contains the new `ai`, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op`, `ai` is `val` if `op` is 0, `val` is the second element in `a`.**
