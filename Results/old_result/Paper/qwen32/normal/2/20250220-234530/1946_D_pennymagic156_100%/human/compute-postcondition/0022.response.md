The given code snippet performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`. 

Given the initial state:
- `ai` is 0
- `val` is the second element in the list `a`

After executing the line `ai ^= val`, the new value of `ai` will be `0 ^ val`, which simplifies to `val`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `[val]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the second element in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ai` has been updated to be equal to `val`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
