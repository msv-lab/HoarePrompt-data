Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on whether `i + x - 1` is less than `n`: if true, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`; `i` is incremented by 1 if the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is true, otherwise `i` is set to 2; `sums` is recalculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if the condition is true, otherwise `sums` is `sums + a[0]`. If `i` was initially 0, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` includes this new `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is adjusted based on the condition involving `i` and `x`, and `ans` includes either the new `sums` or `sums + a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` was initially 0, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` includes the newly appended `sums`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` includes an additional element which is the current value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` includes an additional element which is the current value of `sums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
