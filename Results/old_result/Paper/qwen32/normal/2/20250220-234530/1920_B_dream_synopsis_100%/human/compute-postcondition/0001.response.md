The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n`, `k`, or `x`, only that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.

After executing the code, `n`, `k`, and `x` will hold the values read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.**
