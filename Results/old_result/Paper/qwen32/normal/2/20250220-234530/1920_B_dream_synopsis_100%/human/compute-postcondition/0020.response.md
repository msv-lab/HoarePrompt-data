To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `k` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a certain value.
- We need to increment `i` to proceed to the next iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the current value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.

2. **Determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

3. **Check the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i_prev + 1` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Given that the loop variable `i` is the only one that can be adjusted, we need to increment `i` by 1.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `3`.
- The loop will continue as long as `3 <= k`.

### General Case:
- If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

### Final State:
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `sums`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

For clarity, if `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is 3.**

Generalizing:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1.**

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
