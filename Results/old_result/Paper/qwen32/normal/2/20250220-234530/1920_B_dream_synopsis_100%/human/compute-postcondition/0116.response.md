Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements, where the first two elements are the initial value of `sums` and the third element is the updated value of `sums`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
