Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `sums`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
