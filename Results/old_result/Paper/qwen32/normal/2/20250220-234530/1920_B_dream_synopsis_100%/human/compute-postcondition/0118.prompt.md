Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if \(i + x - 1 < n\), `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, if \(i + x - 1 \geq n\), `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`. If `i` was initially 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if \(i + x - 1 < n\), `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, if \(i + x - 1 \geq n\), `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements. If `i` was initially 0, the first two elements of `ans` are `sum1` and the third element is `sums` updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the first two elements of `ans` are the initial value of `sums` and the third element is the updated value of `sums` which is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
