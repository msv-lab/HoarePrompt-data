The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` to it. Given that `a` is a reversed (descending) sorted list of integers, `sums` will increase by the value of `a[i-1]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` remain integers such that k ≥ 0.
- `x` remains the integers read from the input.
- `a` remains a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `sum1` remains the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `ans` remains a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
