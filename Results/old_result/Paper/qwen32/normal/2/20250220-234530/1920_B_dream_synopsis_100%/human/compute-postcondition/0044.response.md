The code snippet reverses the list `a`. This means the order of elements in `a` is flipped, but the elements themselves remain the same. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.**
