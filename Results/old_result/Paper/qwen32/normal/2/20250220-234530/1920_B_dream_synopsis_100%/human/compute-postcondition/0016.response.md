Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`. `sums` is updated to be `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `sums` is increased by the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
