Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of `i` satisfies the condition \(i + x - 1 < n\)**.
