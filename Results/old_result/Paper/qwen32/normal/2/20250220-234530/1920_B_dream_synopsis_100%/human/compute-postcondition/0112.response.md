Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In natural language: The value of `sums` is updated by adding the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` and subtracting twice the element at index `i + x - 1` of the list `a`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
