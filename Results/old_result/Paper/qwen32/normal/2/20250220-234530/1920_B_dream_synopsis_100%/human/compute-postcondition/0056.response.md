The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` adds the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the variable `sums`. Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, and `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `a[i - 1]` is a specific integer from the list.

Since `sums` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it was previously initialized to 0 or some other value before this line of code was executed. After executing the line, `sums` will be updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`. `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.**
