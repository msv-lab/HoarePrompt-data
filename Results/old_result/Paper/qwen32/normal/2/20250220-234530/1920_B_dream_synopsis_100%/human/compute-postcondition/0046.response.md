The given code snippet resets the `ans` list to an empty list. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list.**
