Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` is an integer such that k ≥ 0, `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list. The current value of `i` is 0.**
