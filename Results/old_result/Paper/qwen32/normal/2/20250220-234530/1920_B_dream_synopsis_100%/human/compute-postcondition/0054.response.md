Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the single element `sums`, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Natural Language: The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `sums`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
