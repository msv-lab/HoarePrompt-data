To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `k`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, to move to the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1.

Let's analyze the current state and how it should change:
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
  - `n` is the first integer from the input
  - `k` is at least 0
  - `x` is the third integer from the input
  - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
  - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`
  - `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`
  - `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided
  - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more specific about `i`:
- If `i` was `j` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `j + 1`.

So, if `i` was `j` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided; `i` is \(j + 1\)**.

If we assume `i` was `j` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `j + 1`. Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, if `i` was 0 at the start and 0 at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 1. Thus, generally:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided; `i` is \(i + 1\)**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`; `sums` is updated based on the conditions provided; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
