The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` and `k` are integers, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed sums for each iteration of the loop.**
