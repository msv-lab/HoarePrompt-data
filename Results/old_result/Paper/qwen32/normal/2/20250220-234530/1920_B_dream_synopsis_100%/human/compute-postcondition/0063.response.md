The code modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `sums` which is updated in the `ans` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
