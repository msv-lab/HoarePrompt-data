Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sums` is updated by adding the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` and subtracting twice the element at index `i+x-1` of the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
