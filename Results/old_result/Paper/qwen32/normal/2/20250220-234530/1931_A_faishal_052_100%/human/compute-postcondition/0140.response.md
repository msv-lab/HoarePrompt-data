The code snippet `temp = ''` sets the variable `temp` to an empty string. This affects only the variable `temp`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 2, `i` is 3**.
