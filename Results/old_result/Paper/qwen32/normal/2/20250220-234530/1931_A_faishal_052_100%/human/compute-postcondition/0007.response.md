Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the single element [1], `lex` is an input integer, and the current value of `lex` is less than 28.**

Explanation: The only change is that the list `arr` now contains one element, which is the integer `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
