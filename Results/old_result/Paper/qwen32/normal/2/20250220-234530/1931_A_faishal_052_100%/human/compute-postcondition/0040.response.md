Let's analyze the loop and determine the final output state based on the provided conditions.

The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times. The loop modifies the variable `lex` and appends values to the list `arr` based on the value of `lex`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `1`.
   - If `28 <= lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.
   - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`)**:
   - The same logic as the first iteration applies, but now the value of `lex` has been modified from the previous iteration.

Given the loop only runs twice, we need to consider the possible states of `lex` after each iteration:

- If `lex` starts less than 28, after the first iteration, `lex` will be `lex - 1` and `arr` will be `[1]`. In the second iteration, if `lex - 1` is still less than 28, `lex` becomes `lex - 2` and `arr` becomes `[1, 1]`. If `lex - 1` is between 28 and 51, `lex` becomes `lex - 27` and `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`. If `lex - 1` is between 52 and 78, `lex` becomes `lex - 53` and `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
  
- If `lex` starts between 28 and 51, after the first iteration, `lex` will be `lex - 26` and `arr` will be `[26]`. In the second iteration, if `lex - 26` is less than 28, `lex` becomes `lex - 27` and `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`. If `lex - 26` is between 28 and 51, `lex` becomes `lex - 52` and `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`. If `lex - 26` is between 52 and 78, `lex` becomes `lex - 78` and `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.

- If `lex` starts between 52 and 78, after the first iteration, `lex` will be `lex - 26` and `arr` will be `[26]`. In the second iteration, if `lex - 26` is less than 28, `lex` becomes `lex - 27` and `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`. If `lex - 26` is between 28 and 51, `lex` becomes `lex - 52` and `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`. If `lex - 26` is between 52 and 78, `lex` becomes `lex - 78` and `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.

- If `lex` starts greater than 78, `arr` remains empty after both iterations.

Since the loop runs exactly 2 times, the final state of `arr` will depend on the initial value of `lex`. However, the variable `info` remains an empty list throughout the loop, and `cases` remains unchanged.

**Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list with up to two elements depending on the initial value of `lex`, and `lex` is updated based on the described rules.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `info` remains an empty list, `cases` stays the same, and `arr` will contain either zero, one, or two elements based on the initial value of `lex`. The exact contents of `arr` and the final value of `lex` depend on the initial value of `lex`.
