Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `lex` is an integer, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` was initially 28 or more, `arr` is [26] if `lex` is less than 52 or between 52 and 78 inclusive, and `arr` remains an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78.**
