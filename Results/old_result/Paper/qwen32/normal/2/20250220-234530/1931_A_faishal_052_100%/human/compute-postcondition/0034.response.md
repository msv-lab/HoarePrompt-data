The code snippet provided attempts to modify the variable `lex` by subtracting 26 from its current value. However, the initial state does not include any information about the variable `lex`. Since `lex` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its new value after the operation.

Given that the only variables mentioned in the initial state are `cases`, `info`, and `j`, and none of these are affected by the code snippet, the output state remains unchanged for these variables.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing [26], `j` is 2**.
