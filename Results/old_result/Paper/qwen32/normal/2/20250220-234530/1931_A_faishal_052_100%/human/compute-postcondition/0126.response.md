Given the initial state, `arr` is already set to `info[0]`, which is described as "the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it." This means `arr` is already sorted except for the last element, `lex`.

When the line `arr.sort()` is executed, it sorts the entire `arr` list. Since `arr` was already sorted except for the last element `lex`, after sorting, `arr` will be fully sorted.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is now the fully sorted list from `info[0]`.**

In simpler terms, `arr` is now fully sorted, and all other variables remain unchanged.
