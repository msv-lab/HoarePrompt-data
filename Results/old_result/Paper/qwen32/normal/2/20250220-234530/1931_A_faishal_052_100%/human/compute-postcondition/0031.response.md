The given code attempts to append the value `1` to a list named `arr`. However, the initial state does not include a definition or initialization of `arr`. Assuming there was a typo and the intention was to append to `info` (as it's the only list mentioned in the initial state), the corrected code would be:

```python
info.append(1)
```

Given this assumption, here is the output state:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing the element `[1]`, `j` is 2**.

This means that the list `info` now contains one element, which is the integer `1`. The values of `cases` and `j` remain unchanged.
