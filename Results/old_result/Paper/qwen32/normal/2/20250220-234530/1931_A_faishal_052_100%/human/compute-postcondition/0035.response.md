The code snippet provided attempts to append the value `26` to a list named `arr`. However, in the initial state, there is no mention of a list named `arr`. Assuming `arr` was intended to be `info` (since `info` is the only list mentioned), the value `26` would be appended to `info`.

Given the initial state and the assumption that `arr` should be `info`, the updated state would be:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing [26], `j` is 2**.
