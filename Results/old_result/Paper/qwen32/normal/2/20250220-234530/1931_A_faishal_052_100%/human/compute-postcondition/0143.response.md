The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will execute when `j` is 0, 1, or 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since the loop condition is `j in range(3)`, the loop will not execute again if `j` is incremented to 3.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` should be incremented to the next value within the range, which is not possible since `j` is already at its maximum value in the range. However, if we consider the state right before the last iteration, `j` would have been 1, and the loop would have executed again with `j` being 2.

Since the task is to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, and given that `j` is currently 2, the loop will not execute again. But if we hypothetically consider the state right before the last iteration:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`, `j` is 1, `i` is 3**

However, strictly adhering to the current state where `j` is 2, the loop will not execute again, so there is no valid next iteration state within the given range. 

If we strictly follow the requirement to provide the state at the start of the next iteration based on the current state:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2, `i` is 3** (indicating the loop will not execute again)
