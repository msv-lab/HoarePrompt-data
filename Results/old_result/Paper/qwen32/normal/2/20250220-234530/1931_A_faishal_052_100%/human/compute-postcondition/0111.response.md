Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with `26` appended to it if `lex` > 78, otherwise just `arr`), `j` is 1, `i` is 2, and `lex` is `lex - 26` if `lex` <= 78.**
