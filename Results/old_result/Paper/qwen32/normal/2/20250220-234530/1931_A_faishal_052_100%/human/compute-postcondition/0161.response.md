Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78) and processes it to produce a string of three characters. The string is derived by converting specific values related to `n` into characters using ASCII values, and the function prints this string for each test case.**
