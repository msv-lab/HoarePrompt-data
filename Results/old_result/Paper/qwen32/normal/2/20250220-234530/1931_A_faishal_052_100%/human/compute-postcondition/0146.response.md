The given code snippet modifies the variable `temp` by appending a new character to it. The new character is determined by converting the value of `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character using the `chr` function.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists.
- `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case.
- `temp` is initially set to `chr(info[3][2] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`.
- `j` is 3.
- `i` is 3.

The line `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)` appends `chr(info[3][3] + 96)` to `temp`.

Therefore, the new value of `temp` will be the concatenation of its previous value and the new character derived from `info[3][3] + 96`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is `chr(info[3][2] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96) + chr(info[3][3] + 96)`, `j` is 3, `i` is 3**.
