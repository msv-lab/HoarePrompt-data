The code appends the current value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since the initial state specifies that `arr` can have up to two elements depending on the initial value of `lex`, after appending `lex`, `arr` will now have one more element than it originally had.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list with up to three elements (originally up to two, now one more element has been added), `lex` is updated based on the described rules.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` is added to the list `arr`, increasing its size by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
