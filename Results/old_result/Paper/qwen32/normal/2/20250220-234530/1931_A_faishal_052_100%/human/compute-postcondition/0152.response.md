The code snippet modifies the `temp` variable by appending a character to it based on the value of `info[i][j]`. Specifically, it converts `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character using the `chr()` function and appends it to `temp`.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists.
- `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case.
- `temp` is an empty string.
- `j` is 3.
- `i` is 4.

The value of `temp` changes from an empty string to a string containing one character, which is determined by `info[4][3] + 96`. 

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the character `chr(info[4][3] + 96)`, `j` is 3, `i` is 4**.
