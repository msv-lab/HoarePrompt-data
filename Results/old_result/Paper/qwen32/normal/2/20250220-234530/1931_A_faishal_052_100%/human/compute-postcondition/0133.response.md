The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the implicit `range(3)` which defines the iterations. Since `j` is the only variable explicitly mentioned in the loop header, it's the only one we can adjust.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 0. In the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, as per the behavior of the `range` function in Python.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the character `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, `j` is 1**
