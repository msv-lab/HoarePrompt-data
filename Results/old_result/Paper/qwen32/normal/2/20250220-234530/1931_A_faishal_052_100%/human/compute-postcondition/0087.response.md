The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list. This means the previous contents of `arr` within the `info` list are no longer accessible via `arr`. However, the `info` list itself remains unchanged unless further modifications are made to it. The values of `cases`, `lex`, `j`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`, and `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is an empty list.**
