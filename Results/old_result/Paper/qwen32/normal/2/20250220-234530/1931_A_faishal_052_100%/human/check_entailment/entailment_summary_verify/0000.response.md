### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary. We'll focus on the correctness of the logic used to determine the lexicographically smallest word.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Lexicographical Order**: The goal is to find the smallest possible combination of three letters such that their positional sum equals the given integer `n`.
2. **Positional Values**: Each letter from 'a' to 'z' corresponds to a value from 1 to 26. The sum of these values for a three-letter word should match `n`.
3. **Algorithm Logic**: The program should iteratively assign the smallest possible values to the three letters while ensuring their sum equals `n`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initial Loop for Two Letters**:
  - The loop runs twice to assign values to the first two letters.
  - If `lex < 28`, it assigns `1` to both letters, which is correct for small values.
  - If `lex >= 28`, it assigns `26` to both letters, which is incorrect because it overestimates the values too early.

- **Handling Remaining Value**:
  - After assigning values to the first two letters, the remaining value (`lex`) is assigned to the third letter.
  - This approach does not ensure the smallest possible combination.

- **Sorting**:
  - Sorting the array after assignment is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results, as the goal is to maintain the smallest possible order from the start.

#### Correct Approach:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
- Ensure that the sum of these values does not exceed `n`.
- Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
- Ensure that the values are assigned in a way that maintains lexicographical order.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- For `n = 24`:
  - Assign `1` to the first letter.
  - Assign `1` to the second letter.
  - Remaining value is `22`, so assign `22` to the third letter.
  - Result: `aav` (which is correct).

- For `n = 28`:
  - Assign `1` to the first letter.
  - Assign `1` to the second letter.
  - Remaining value is `26`, so assign `26` to the third letter.
  - Result: `aaz` (which is correct).

- For `n = 52`:
  - Assign `1` to the first letter.
  - Assign `26` to the second letter.
  - Remaining value is `25`, so assign `25` to the third letter.
  - Result: `acz` (which is incorrect; should be `aaz`).

#### Conclusion:
The program's logic for handling values greater than or equal to 28 is flawed. It incorrectly assigns `26` to both letters prematurely, leading to incorrect results. Sorting the array after assignment is also unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
