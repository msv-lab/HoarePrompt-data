Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word (consisting of lowercase Latin letters) that sums up to a given integer `n` when the positions of the letters in the alphabet are added together.

### Key Points:
- Each letter has a position from 1 to 26.
- We need to find the smallest possible combination of three such positions that add up to `n`.
- The result should be sorted lexicographically.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Generating Possible Combinations:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice, trying to assign values to the first two positions:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it assigns 1 to the current position and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it assigns 26 to the current position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again assigns 26 to the current position and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it assigns the remaining value of `lex` to the third position.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted to ensure the positions are in ascending order.
   - The sorted list `arr` is appended to the `info` list.

3. **Generating Output:**
   - For each test case stored in `info`, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting each position in `arr` to its corresponding letter using `chr(position + 96)`.
   - The constructed string `temp` is printed as the output for that test case.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Generating Positions:**
  - The logic used to generate the positions is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all possible combinations of three positions that sum up to `n`.
  - Specifically, the conditions for assigning 1 or 26 are too restrictive and do not cover all cases.
- **Lexicographical Order:**
  - While the program sorts the positions, it does not guarantee that the resulting word will be the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given sum `n`.

### Example:
For `n = 24`, the correct smallest word is `"aav"`, but the program might generate something else due to its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic for generating the positions and ensuring the lexicographically smallest word, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
