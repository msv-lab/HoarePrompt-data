To determine the output of the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists.
- `lex` is adjusted based on some rules for each test case (though this detail is not directly relevant to determining `temp`).
- `temp` is a string constructed from specific elements within the `info` list.
- Specifically, `temp` is constructed using the characters `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[4][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[4][2] + 96)`.
- `j` is set to 2.
- `i` is set to 4.

Given these details, we need to focus on the construction of `temp`:
- `temp` is built from the fifth sublist of `info` (since indexing starts at 0, `info[4]` refers to the fifth sublist).
- Within this sublist, the first three elements (`info[4][0]`, `info[4][1]`, and `info[4][2]`) are used.
- Each of these elements is converted to a character using the formula `chr(element + 96)`.

The formula `chr(x + 96)` converts an integer `x` to a lowercase letter where `x = 1` corresponds to 'a', `x = 2` corresponds to 'b', and so on up to `x = 26` corresponding to 'z'. 

Thus, the characters in `temp` depend on the values of `info[4][0]`, `info[4][1]`, and `info[4][2]`.

Since the exact values of `info[4][0]`, `info[4][1]`, and `info[4][2]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact characters that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **temp (where temp is a string consisting of the characters chr(info[4][0] + 96), chr(info[4][1] + 96), and chr(info[4][2] + 96))**
