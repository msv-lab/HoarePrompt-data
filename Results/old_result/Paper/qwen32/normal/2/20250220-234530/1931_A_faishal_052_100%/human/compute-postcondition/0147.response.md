To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables involved.

The given loop is:
```python
for j in range(3):
    temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
```

From the problem statement, we know:
- The loop runs for `j` from 0 to 2 (3 iterations).
- `temp` is initialized as an empty string.
- `i` is fixed at 3 throughout the loop.

Let's break down the iterations:
1. **First Iteration (j=0)**:
   - `temp = temp + chr(info[3][0] + 96)`
   - `temp` becomes `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`

2. **Second Iteration (j=1)**:
   - `temp = temp + chr(info[3][1] + 96)`
   - `temp` becomes `chr(info[3][0] + 96) + chr(info[3][1] + 96)`

3. **Third Iteration (j=2)**:
   - `temp = temp + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`
   - `temp` becomes `chr(info[3][0] + 96) + chr(info[3][1] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`

After these three iterations, the loop terminates because `j` reaches the upper limit of the range (3).

Thus, the final value of `temp` will be the concatenation of characters derived from `info[3][0]`, `info[3][1]`, and `info[3][2]`.

The final output state is:
- `cases` remains an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` remains a list containing `cases` sublists.
- `lex` remains adjusted based on the described rules for each test case.
- `temp` is `chr(info[3][0] + 96) + chr(info[3][1] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`.
- `j` is 3 (after the loop ends).
- `i` remains 3.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is `chr(info[3][0] + 96) + chr(info[3][1] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`, `j` is 3, `i` is 3.**

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, `temp` will contain the concatenated characters derived from the ASCII values of `info[3][0] + 96`, `info[3][1] + 96`, and `info[3][2] + 96`. The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `lex`, `j`, and `i`) will retain their respective states as described.
