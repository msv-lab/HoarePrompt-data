The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`. Since `i` is incremented in each iteration, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. The value of `cases` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value (let's say `k`), and `cases` is a constant value between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k + 1` and it should still be less than `cases`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can denote the new state as follows:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to be more precise, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules, `i` is incremented by 1**

If we need to be more specific about the transition, we can say:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules, `i` is now `i + 1`**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate generalization would be:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules, `i` is incremented by 1**

But to match the format of the previous examples, we can write:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules, `i` is `i + 1`**

So the final answer is:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules, `i` is `i + 1`**
