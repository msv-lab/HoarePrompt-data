Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 28, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is [26]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.**
