Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the updated `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being the updated `arr` with `26` appended to it if `lex` > 78, or `arr` with `1` appended to it if `lex` < 28, or just `arr` if 28 <= `lex` <= 78), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` < 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26. Additionally, if `lex` <= 78, `lex` is further decreased by 26 from its previously adjusted value.**
