Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is the integer value obtained from the input, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `j` is 0, `i` is 2. If `lex` was originally less than 28, then `lex` is reduced by 1 and `arr` becomes [1]. If `lex` was originally less than 52 but at least 28, then `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` becomes [26]. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater but less than or equal to 78, then `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` becomes [26]. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, then `arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either 1 appended to it if `lex` < 28, or 26 appended to it if `lex` > 78, or just `arr` if 28 <= `lex` <= 78), `j` is 1, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` < 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either `1` appended to it if `lex` was originally less than 28, `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78, or `[26, 26]` appended to it if `lex` was originally greater than 78), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if it was originally less than 28, and decreased by 26 otherwise. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, it is further decreased by 26 if it is now between 52 and 78 inclusive.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
