The given code snippet initializes a variable `temp` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `cases`, `info`, or `lex`. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `temp`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is an empty string.**
