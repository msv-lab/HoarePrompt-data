The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially an empty list, after appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1]`. The values of `cases`, `info`, `lex`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is the integer value obtained from the input and is less than 28, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is [1]**.
