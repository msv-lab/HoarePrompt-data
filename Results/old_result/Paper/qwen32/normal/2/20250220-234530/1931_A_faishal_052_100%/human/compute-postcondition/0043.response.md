The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. The values of `cases` and `lex` remain unchanged. Since `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, it will be added as a single element (a sublist) to `info`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is a sorted list with up to three elements, `lex` is updated based on the described rules.**
