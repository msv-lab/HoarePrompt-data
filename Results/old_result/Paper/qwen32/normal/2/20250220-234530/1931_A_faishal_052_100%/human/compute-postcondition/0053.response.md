The code appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `arr` contains one element, which is `[26]`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `lex` is greater than or equal to 28, and `lex` is less than 52.**
