The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will execute twice if the initial value of `j` is 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing two sublists.
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is 2.

Since the loop iterates over `j` in the range(2), the next value of `j` should be 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

The values of `cases`, `info`, and `i` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `j` is 1, `i` is 2**
