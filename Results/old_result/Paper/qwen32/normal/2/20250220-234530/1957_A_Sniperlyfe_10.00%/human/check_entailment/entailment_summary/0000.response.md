Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, with the constraint that each polygon must have at least 3 sides (since a polygon cannot be formed with fewer than 3 sides). However, the current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly assumes that any group of 4 sticks of the same length can form a square (a type of regular polygon), regardless of the number of sides required for the polygon.

The logic in `func_1` sums up the integer division of the count of each unique stick length by 4, which would work correctly only if the goal was to form squares exclusively. But since the problem requires forming any regular polygon (not just squares), the solution needs to account for polygons with different numbers of sides.

For example, in the fourth test case, the program should recognize that it can form a pentagon (5 sides) with sticks of length 2 and a square (4 sides) with sticks of length 4. However, the current implementation does not consider this flexibility and will only count complete sets of 4 sticks of the same length.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect because it does not fully address the problem's requirement to form polygons with varying numbers of sides.

Correctness: **False**
