The code appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `p` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `p` will contain one element, which is the value of `c`.

The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged, and `c` is described as `c + x`, but since no further operations are performed on `c` in the given code snippet, we assume `c` retains its value.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the single element `c`, `c` is `c + x`**.
