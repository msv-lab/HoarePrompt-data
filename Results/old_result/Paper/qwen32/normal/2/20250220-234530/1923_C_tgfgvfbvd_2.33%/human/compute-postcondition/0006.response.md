The code snippet `c += x` increments the variable `c` by the value of `x`. However, `x` is not defined in the initial state provided. Given the information, we cannot determine the exact new value of `c` because `x` is unknown. 

Since `x` is not specified, we can only say that `c` will be its current value plus `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is `c + x`**.
