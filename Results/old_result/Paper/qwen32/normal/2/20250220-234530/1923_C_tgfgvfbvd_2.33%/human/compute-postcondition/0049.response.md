The given code snippet `c += x` attempts to increment the variable `c` by the value of `x`. However, `x` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming there was a typo and `x` should be `_` (as `_` is the only undefined variable in the context provided that could logically fit here), the operation would be `c += _`.

Given that `_` is initially 1, the operation `c += _` would increment `c` by 1.

Therefore, the updated value of `c` would be 1 (since it was initially 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 1, `_` is 1**.
