The code snippet `s = p[b - 1]` updates the value of `s` to be equal to `p[b - 1]`. This means that the previous condition for `s` (which was dependent on whether `a - 2 >= 0` or not) is overridden, and now `s` is simply the cumulative sum up to the `b-1` index of the list `p`.

Given the initial conditions, the only variable that changes is `s`. All other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are the integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b - 1]`; `_` is 1.**
