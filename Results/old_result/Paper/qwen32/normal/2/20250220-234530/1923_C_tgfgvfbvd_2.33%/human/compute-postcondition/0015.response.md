In the given for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and `m`. The loop will execute based on the value of `m`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `m` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `m` is at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted according to the task requirements.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`**.
