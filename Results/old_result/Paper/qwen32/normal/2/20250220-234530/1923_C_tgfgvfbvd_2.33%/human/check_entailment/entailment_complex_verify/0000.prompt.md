You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); the loop has executed `t` times, with each execution involving reading `n` and `m`, a list `l` of `n` integers, computing cumulative sums into list `p`, and processing `m` queries. Each query involves reading `a` and `b`, computing `s` as the sum of elements from index `a-1` to `b-1` in `l`, and printing 'YES' if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, otherwise 'NO'. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` are reset for each test case, while `_` in the outer loop is decremented until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function calculates the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) and prints 'YES' if the sum is at least twice the number of elements in the queried range and the range contains more than one element; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good".
- A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
  1. The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. Each element `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`.
  3. Each element `b_i` is greater than 0.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses prefix sums to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - It calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and stores them in the list `p`.
   - This allows for quick calculation of the sum of any subarray `c[l_i:r_i]`.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` using the prefix sums.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray `(b - a + 1)`. If so, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Verification Against Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: The sum of `a` equals the sum of `b`. The program ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, which implies that we can construct `b` such that the sum condition holds.
- **Condition 2**: `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`. If the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, we can construct `b` by assigning values to `b_i` such that `b_i ≠ a_i` and `b_i > 0`. For example, we can assign `b_i = a_i + 1` for all `i`, ensuring that the sum condition still holds.
- **Condition 3**: `b_i > 0`. Since we are assigning `b_i = a_i + 1` (or any positive value different from `a_i`), this condition is satisfied.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- **Subarray Length 1**: If the subarray has only one element, the sum condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` cannot be satisfied unless the element is at least 2. If the element is 1, it cannot be split into two different positive numbers, hence the program correctly returns "NO".
- **All Elements Equal**: If all elements in the subarray are equal, the sum condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` must still hold. For example, if the subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`, the sum is 3, which is not enough to satisfy the condition for a subarray of length 3, so the program correctly returns "NO".
- **General Case**: For any subarray, if the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray, the program correctly identifies it as "good".

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly determines whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray and checks if the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it correctly identifies the subarray as "good" by ensuring that a corresponding array `b` can be constructed that satisfies all the conditions. The program handles edge cases such as subarrays of length 1 and subarrays with all elements equal correctly.
