The code snippet `c += x` increments the variable `c` by the value of `x`. Given that `c` was initially defined as `c + x`, after executing the code, `c` will effectively be `c + x + x`, which simplifies to `c + 2*x`.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` remain the integers obtained from the input.
- `l` remains the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
- `p` remains the list containing the single element `c`.
- `c` is now `c + 2*x`.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is a list containing the single element `c`; `c` is `c + 2*x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
