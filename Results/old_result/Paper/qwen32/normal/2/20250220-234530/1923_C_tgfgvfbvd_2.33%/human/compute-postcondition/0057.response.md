To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given loop and the provided states after the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`. During each iteration:
- The variable `c` (cumulative sum) is incremented by the current element `x`.
- The updated value of `c` is appended to the list `p`.

### Initial State:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` and `m`: Integers with `m > 0`.
- `l`: A list of integers.
- `p`: An initially empty list.
- `c`: Initialized to 0.
- `_`: Initialized to 1 (though `_` is not used in the loop).

### Output States After Iterations:
1. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - `p = [1]`
   - `c = 1`
   
2. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - `p = [1, 1 + x]`
   - `c = 1 + x`
   
3. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - `p = [1, 1 + x, 1 + x + y]`
   - `c = 1 + x + y`

### Generalizing the Pattern:
- After `k` iterations, `p` contains the cumulative sums starting from 1 up to the `k`th element of `l`.
- `c` holds the cumulative sum of the first `k` elements of `l` plus 1.

### Final State:
The loop will iterate over all elements in `l`. Therefore, after all iterations:
- `p` will contain the cumulative sums starting from 1 up to the last element of `l`.
- `c` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `l` plus 1.

### Calculation:
Let's denote the elements of `l` as `l[0], l[1], ..., l[n-1]` where `n` is the length of `l`.
- `p` will be `[1, 1 + l[0], 1 + l[0] + l[1], ..., 1 + l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`
- `c` will be `1 + l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`

### Final Output State:
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `_` remain unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 1.
- `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing, `p` will have a series of cumulative sums starting from 1, and `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l` plus 1. All other variables remain as they were initially.
