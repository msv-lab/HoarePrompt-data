The code snippet `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Given that `c` was initially defined as `c + 2*x`, and `x` is the next element in the list `l`, after executing the code, `c` will be updated to its current value plus `x`.

Let's break down the changes:
- Initially, `c` was `c + 2*x`.
- After `c += x`, `c` becomes `(c + 2*x) + x`, which simplifies to `c + 3*x`.

Therefore, the new value of `c` is `c + 3*x`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `c`, `c` is `c + 3*x`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.
