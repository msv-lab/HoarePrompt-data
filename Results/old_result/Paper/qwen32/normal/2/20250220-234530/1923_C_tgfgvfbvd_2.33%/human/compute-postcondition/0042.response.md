Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has executed `m` times, with each iteration involving the reading of integers `a` and `b` from the input, calculating `s` based on the conditions provided, and printing 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds. The variable `_` in the loop head is now 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state except for the decrement of `_` in each iteration.**_

In simpler terms, after the loop has run for `m` iterations, it will have processed `m` pairs of integers `(a, b)`, calculated the sum `s` for each pair, and printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given condition. The loop counter `_` will be 0, indicating that all iterations are complete. All other variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` will retain their initial values unless modified within the loop, which they are not in this case.
