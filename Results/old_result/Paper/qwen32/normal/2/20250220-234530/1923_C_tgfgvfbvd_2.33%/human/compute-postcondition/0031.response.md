Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers, with `m` being greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.
- Either `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, or `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`.
- `_` is decremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Explanation:
The conditions and calculations described in the initial state do not affect the content of the print statement. The print statement does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `_`) because it directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
