The code snippet provided increments the variable `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` is initially set to 2 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 1 if `s[1]` is 'R'. After executing `l += 1`, the new value of `l` will be 3 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 2 if `s[1]` is 'R'. 

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[1]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[1], a[2]]`; if `s[1]` is 'R', `b` is `[a[n-1], a[n-2], a[1]]`; `l` is 3 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 2 if `s[1]` is 'R'; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `n - 2` if `s[1]` is 'R'; `i` is 2.**
