Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[1]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[1]]` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `[a[0], a[n-1]]` if `s[1]` is 'R'; `l` is 2 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 1 if `s[1]` is 'R'; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `n - 2` if `s[1]` is 'R'. Otherwise, if `s[1]` is 'R', `b` is `[a[n-1], a[n-2]]` if `s[1]` is 'R' and `[a[n-1], a[0]]` if `s[1]` is 'L'; `l` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 0 if `s[1]` is 'R'; `r` is `n - 2` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `n - 3` if `s[1]` is 'R'. `i` is 1.**
