The code appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Given that `p` is initially 1, `ans` will now contain the single element `[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers (constructed from `a` based on `s`), `l` and `r` are such that `l` equals `r + 1` (or vice versa), `ans` is [1], `p` is 1**
