### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its logic against the problem statement.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the list `a` of `n` integers, and the string `s` of `n` commands.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the commands and computes the required remainders.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to `b` and decrements `r`.

3. **Computing Products:**
   - After constructing `b`, the function initializes an empty list `ans` and a variable `p` to 1.
   - It then iterates through `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product of the current element and the previous product.
   - It appends the updated product `p` to `ans`.

4. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, the function returns the list `ans` in reverse order.

#### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and stores these products in `ans`.
  - However, the problem requires the remainder of the product of all elements of the current state of the array `a` at the beginning of each command, not the product of elements in `b`.
  - The current implementation does not compute the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each command but instead computes the product of the elements in the order specified by `s`.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The problem explicitly asks for the remainder of the product when divided by `m`. The current implementation does not apply the modulo operation during the product calculation.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each command and take the result modulo `m`. This requires maintaining the product of the elements and adjusting it as elements are removed from `a`.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness:** **False**
