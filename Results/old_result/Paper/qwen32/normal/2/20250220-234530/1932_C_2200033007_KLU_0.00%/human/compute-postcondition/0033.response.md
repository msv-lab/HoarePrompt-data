The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `p` by the variable `v`. Given the initial state, `p` is initially set to `v`, and `v` is the second-to-last element of the list `b`.

After executing the line `p = p * v`, the new value of `p` will be `v * v`, which is `v` squared.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers (constructed from `a` based on `s`), `l` and `r` are such that `l` equals `r + 1` (or vice versa), `ans` is [1, v], `p` is `v * v`, `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`**.
