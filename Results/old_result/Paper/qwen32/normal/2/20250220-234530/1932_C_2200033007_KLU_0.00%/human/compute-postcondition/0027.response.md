The given code snippet is `p = p * v`. However, there is no variable `v` defined in the initial state. Given the context and the requirement to strictly follow the provided format, we'll assume that `v` was intended to be another variable from the initial state or a placeholder for a specific value. Since `v` is not defined, we cannot perform the multiplication as specified.

However, if we hypothetically consider `v` to be a variable that should be part of the initial state or assume it's a typo and should be another variable like `p` itself or any other variable, we would need more information. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `v` was meant to be `p` (a common scenario in such problems to demonstrate multiplication).

If `v` were `p`, the operation would be `p = p * p`, which means `p` would be squared.

Given the initial state and assuming `v` is `p`:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `b` remains a list of `n` integers (constructed from `a` based on `s`)
- `l` and `r` remain such that `l` equals `r + 1` (or vice versa)
- `ans` remains an empty list
- `p` is updated to `p * p` (which is `1 * 1` initially, so `p` remains 1)

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers (constructed from `a` based on `s`), `l` and `r` are such that `l` equals `r + 1` (or vice versa), `ans` is an empty list, `p` is 1**.
