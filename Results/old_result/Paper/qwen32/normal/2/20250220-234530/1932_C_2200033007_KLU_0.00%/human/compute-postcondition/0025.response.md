The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `p`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The list `b` contains all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`. The pointers `l` and `r` are such that `l` equals `r + 1` (or vice versa), indicating that all elements have been processed. `ans` is an empty list. `p` is 1.**
