The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially set to `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`. After executing `r -= 1`, `r` will be `n - 2` if `s[1]` is 'L', and `r` will be `n - 3` if `s[1]` is not 'L'.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[1]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[n-1]]`; otherwise, `b` is `[a[n-1], a[n-2]]`. `l` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0. `r` is `n - 2` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`. `i` is 1.**
