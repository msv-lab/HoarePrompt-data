To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and what it modifies. The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`, which contains indices where both the percentage of '0's (`zero_perc`) and '1's (`one_perc`) are at least 50%. For each index `ele` in `lst`, it updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n // 2`) and `ele`.

After all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element; `i` is `n - 2`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `mini` will contain the smallest distance from the middle of the string `s` to any index where both '0's and '1's make up at least 50% of the substring ending at that index. All other variables retain their initial values.
