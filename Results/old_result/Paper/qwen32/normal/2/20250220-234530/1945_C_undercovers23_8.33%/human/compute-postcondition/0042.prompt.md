Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains empty; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 if `s[i]` is '1'; `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 if `s[i]` is '1'; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
