The code snippet appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. None of the other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1`; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 if `s[i]` is '1'; `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 if `s[i]` is '1'; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and is at least 50; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))` and is at least 50.**
