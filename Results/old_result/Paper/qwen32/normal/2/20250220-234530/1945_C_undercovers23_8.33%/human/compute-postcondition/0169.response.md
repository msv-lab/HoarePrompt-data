Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1. `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `one_perc` is updated to be the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, and `zero_perc`) retain their previously defined states and values.
