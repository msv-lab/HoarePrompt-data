To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2.
- `zero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of the string `s` is '0'.
- `one` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '0'.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of `(zero * 100) / (i + 1)`.

However, the variable `o` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `o` was meant to be `one` (a common typo), we can proceed with the calculation.

The new variable `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of `(one - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`. Since `one - one` equals 0, the entire expression simplifies to 0.

Therefore, the only variable that changes is `one_perc`, which is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100) / (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is 0.**
