The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4
- `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'
- `s` is the string input by the user
- `pk` is `n // 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`
- `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`
- `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged
- `mini` is 100000000
- `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged
- `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged
- `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`
- `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`
- `i` is incremented by 1

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged, `mini` is 100000000, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `i` is incremented by 1** 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged, `mini` is 100000000, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `i` is `i + 1`**
