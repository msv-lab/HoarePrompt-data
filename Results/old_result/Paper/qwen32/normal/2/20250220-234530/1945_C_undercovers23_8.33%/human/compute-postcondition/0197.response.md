The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since the initial state does not specify the existence or contents of `final`, we assume `final` is an existing list that may or may not contain elements.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `final`, which now includes `elem` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` includes `elem` as its last element.**
