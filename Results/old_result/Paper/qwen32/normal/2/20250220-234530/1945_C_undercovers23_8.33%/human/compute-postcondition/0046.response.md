The given code snippet updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. 

Given the initial state, `mini` is initially set to the minimum of `100000000` and `abs(pk - ele)`. After executing the line `mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`, `mini` will retain its original value if `abs(pk - ele)` is greater than `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` will be updated to `abs(pk - ele)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of `100000000` and `abs(pk - ele)`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element; `i` is `n - 2`; `ele` is `lst[j + 1]`**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `mini` has been recalculated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged.
