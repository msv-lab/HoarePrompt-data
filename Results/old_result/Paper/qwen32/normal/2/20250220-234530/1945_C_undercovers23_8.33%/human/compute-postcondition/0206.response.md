The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially empty, it now contains one element, which is `n`. The other variables (`c1`, `o`, `pk`, `elem`, `mini`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`final` is sorted in ascending order, containing all indices from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, currently the length of `final` is 1 and it contains `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50.**
