Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`; `mini` is `100000000`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is []; `i` is `n - 2`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is updated to contain `[n]` in the original string `s`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`; `mini` is `100000000`; `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is `[n - 1]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged; `i` is `n - 2`; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s` plus 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `mini` is `100000000`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `lst` is `[n - 1, i + 1]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains `[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s` plus 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `mini` is `100000000`, `zero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', `one` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', `lst` is `[n - 1, n - 1]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains `[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
