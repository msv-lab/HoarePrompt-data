The given code snippet modifies the `nums` list by concatenating the digits of the number `arr[i - 1]` with the number `arr[i]` itself, but only if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`. However, since the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is not checked in the provided code, we will assume the operation is performed regardless of the condition for the purpose of determining the new state.

Here's the impact of the code on the program:

- `nums` is updated to be a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the number `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is either True or False based on the sorting condition, `i` is `i - 1`; `nums` is now a list of digits from `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the `nums` list now contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` concatenated with `arr[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
