The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects the value of `n` but does not affect the values of `t` or `a`.

Given that `n` was initially described as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, after executing the code, `n` will take on whatever integer value is provided by the input, which should still fall within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.

The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.**
