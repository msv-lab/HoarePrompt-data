To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
```

This means the loop variable `i` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is `i - 1` (from the previous iteration)

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1. Therefore, to find the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Since `i` was `i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented back to its value before the decrement.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since `i` was `i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the correct state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the value of `i` before it was decremented. Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, then at the end of the previous iteration, `i` became `k - 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` from the end of the previous iteration.

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

But to be precise with the loop variable `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration as `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k`.

Therefore, the most accurate state representation, without knowing the exact previous value of `i`, is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

But to be clear and precise:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration**.

For the sake of the format requested:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.
