The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`, `i` starts from `m - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `i` is `m - 2`
- If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers, and `ans` is `False` if `nums` was not sorted, causing a break from the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr`, `nums`, or `ans`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` (which is `m - 1` at the start of the first iteration).

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we simply need to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `m - 1`**
