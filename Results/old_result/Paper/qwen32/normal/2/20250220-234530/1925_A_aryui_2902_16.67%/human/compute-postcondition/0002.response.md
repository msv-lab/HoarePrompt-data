Output State: **The program returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of `s` repeated `n` times. Given `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, the output will be the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.**

For example, if `k` is 3 and `n` is 2, the output would be `'abcabc'`.
