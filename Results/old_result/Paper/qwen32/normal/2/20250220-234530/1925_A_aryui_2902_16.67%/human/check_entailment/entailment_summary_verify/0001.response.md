### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summary in light of the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`.
- The string `s` should be of minimal length.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
- It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` letters of the alphabet and repeating this sequence `n` times.
- For example, if `n=2` and `k=3`, the string `s` would be `"abcabc"`.

#### Subsequence Requirement:
- The requirement is that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` letters must appear as a subsequence in `s`.
- For `n=2` and `k=3`, the possible strings of length 2 are: `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`, `"bc"`, `"ca"`, `"cb"`, `"cc"`.
- The string `"abcabc"` does not contain all these subsequences. For instance, `"aa"`, `"bb"`, and `"cc"` are missing.

#### Minimal Length:
- Even if the string contained all subsequences, the constructed string would not necessarily be of minimal length.
- For example, for `n=2` and `k=2`, the string `"baab"` is of minimal length and contains all subsequences `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary correctly describes what the function `func_1()` does: it reads `n` and `k`, and returns a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the criteria of containing all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters.
- It also notes that the string is not guaranteed to be of minimal length.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not generate a string that meets the criteria specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
