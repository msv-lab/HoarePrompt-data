The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`. The state of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` does not affect the loop's continuation; they are influenced by the loop's execution rather than determining it.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0, and assuming the loop has just completed an iteration where `j` had some value, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

Let's assume the previous value of `j` was some value `k`. After the loop completes this iteration, `j` would be `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

Since the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration isn't specified, we'll denote it as `j_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_end + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `j_end + 1`.

State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, `i = n - 1 - (j + 1)`** 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it to:

State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than the current `j + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1**
