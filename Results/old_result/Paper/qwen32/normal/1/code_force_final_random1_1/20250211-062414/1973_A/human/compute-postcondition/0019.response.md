The given code snippet updates the value of `total_points` to be the sum of the elements in the second tuple of `cas_de_test`. This means that `total_points` will now be equal to `p1 + p2 + p3` where `(p1, p2, p3)` is the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Since `total_points` is being reassigned, its new value is dependent on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from the second tuple in `cas_de_test`. The other variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`, and `resultats`) remain unchanged unless their definitions depend on `total_points`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` divided by 2, `egalites` is 3 times the difference between the sum of the first two elements and the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.**
