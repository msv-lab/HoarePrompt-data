Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, and the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'. `idx_A` is not an empty list and now contains the previous elements plus the new element `i`. `A` is a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`.**

In simple terms, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '>', and `idx_A` now includes this index `i` along with any previous indices it contained. The other variables remain unchanged.
