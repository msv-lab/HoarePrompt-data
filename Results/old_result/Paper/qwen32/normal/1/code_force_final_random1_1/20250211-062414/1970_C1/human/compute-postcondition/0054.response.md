Output State: **Queue is not empty (possibly with more elements), `visited` set contains all reachable nodes from `start` including `neighbor`, `current` is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, `dist` is the second element of the queue popped from the queue, `tree[current]` must have at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and the queue now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**

In simpler terms, the queue now has an additional tuple consisting of `neighbor` and `dist + 1`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
