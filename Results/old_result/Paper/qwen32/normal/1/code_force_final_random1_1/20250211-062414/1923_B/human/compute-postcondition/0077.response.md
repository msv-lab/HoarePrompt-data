Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters, `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is incremented by 1. `rest` is `k - 2*delta - delta` where `k - 3*delta > 0`. `delta` is `min(k - 2*delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1.**
