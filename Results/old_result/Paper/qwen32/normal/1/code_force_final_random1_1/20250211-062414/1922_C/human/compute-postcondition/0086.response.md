To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet and see how it modifies the existing variables.

Given:
- Initial State: `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`. `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`. Otherwise, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
```

Impact:
- The value of `d2[i]` is being updated based on the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`.

Since `i` is `n - 3`, we need to update `d2[n - 3]` using the formula provided. The value of `d2[n - 2]` is already defined based on the condition given, and `d2[n - 1]` is set to `1`.

Let's denote:
- `d2[n - 3]` as the new value being calculated.
- `d2[n - 2]` as the value determined by the condition.
- `d2[n - 1]` as `1`.

So, `d2[n - 3]` is calculated as:
```python
d2[n - 3] = l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]
```

Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`. `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`. Otherwise, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1`. `d2[n - 3]` is now `l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]`.**

In natural language:
The value of `d2[n - 3]` is updated to be the difference between `l[n - 3]` and `l[n - 4]` plus the value of `d2[n - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
