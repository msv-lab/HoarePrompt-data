To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 10
- `m` must be at least 15
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3

First, compute the individual parts of the expression:

1. `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10
   \]

2. `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15
   \]

Next, compute the two terms inside the `min` function:

3. `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   n / 10
   \]
   Since `n` is at least 10, the smallest possible value for `n / 10` is `10 / 10 = 1`.

4. `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   m // 15
   \]
   Since `m` is at least 15, the smallest possible value for `m // 15` is `15 // 15 = 1`.

Since both terms are at least 1, the `min` function will return 1.

Therefore, `cnt` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by 1**.
