The code appends a calculated value to `array2`. The value being appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.

Therefore, `array2` now includes this new element, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` is either `[]` or contains elements based on the conditions given plus the new element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is 3.**
