The code snippet modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial conditions, `mex` was initially set to `n`. After executing the code, `mex` will be updated to `n - ar[i]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n - ar[i]`, and the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `mex` has been updated to `n - ar[i]`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
