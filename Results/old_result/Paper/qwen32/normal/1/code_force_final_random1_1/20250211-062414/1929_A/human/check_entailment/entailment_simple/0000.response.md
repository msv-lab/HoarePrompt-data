### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the array. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the difference between the largest and smallest elements is maximized, because the beauty calculation involves only the first and last elements in a sorted array.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we ensure that the smallest element is at the start and the largest element is at the end. This maximizes the difference \(a_n - a_1\), which is the only term considered in the beauty calculation when the array is sorted.

2. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. In the sorted array, this simplifies to just the difference between the last and the first element, i.e., \(a_n - a_1\).

3. **Implementation**: The provided code correctly sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as \(a_n - a_1\). This approach ensures that we get the maximum possible beauty for the given array.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
