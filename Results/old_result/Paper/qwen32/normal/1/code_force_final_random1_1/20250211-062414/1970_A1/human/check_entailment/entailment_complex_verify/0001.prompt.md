You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the corresponding character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the corresponding character in the sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA, which is 0 since their balances are equal and no additional information about their positions is given.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each having attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB`. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`, which is zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `n` `BalanceInfo` objects; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `-position` in descending order for ties)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters of `s` based on their balance values and positions. The balance value represents the net number of opening parentheses encountered up to that point in the string. Characters with lower balance values come first, and for ties, characters appearing later in the original string come first.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement, let's break down the solution step-by-step and compare it against the requirements.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - The goal is to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - To do this, we need to calculate the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
   - We then sort these characters based on their prefix balance in ascending order, breaking ties by sorting positions in descending order.
   - Finally, we construct the new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` appears to be a comparator function used for sorting, but it's not directly used in the code snippet provided. It seems redundant since the sorting is done using a lambda function in `func_2`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle operation.
     - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the input sequence.
     - It iterates through the input string `s`, calculating the prefix balance for each character and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`.
     - After constructing the `balance_info` list, it sorts this list using a lambda function that sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `position` in descending order.
     - It constructs the final result by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints the result.

3. **Verification Against the Problem Statement:**
   - The code correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character.
   - It sorts the characters based on the specified criteria (prefix balance in ascending order, position in descending order when balances are equal).
   - The final sequence constructed from the sorted characters is printed, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues or logical errors in the implementation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
