To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs and how the variables evolve with each iteration. The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is provided as part of the input. For each iteration, the loop reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` and applies specific logic based on the conditions provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Loop Iteration Logic**:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, the loop prints `A * B`.
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the loop prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the loop calculates `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`.

2. **Final Output State**:
   - After all `n` iterations, the loop will have printed a value for each set of `A`, `B`, and `C` read from the input.
   - The variable `i` will have reached the value `n`, indicating that all iterations are complete.
   - The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` will hold the values from the last iteration, but these values are not retained outside the loop.
   - The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Given the above understanding, the final output state can be described as follows:

- The loop has completed all `n` iterations.
- For each iteration, the appropriate value has been printed based on the conditions.
- The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` from the last iteration are not retained.
- The variable `i` is equal to `n`.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the variables involved in the loop head and body, and considering that the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` from the last iteration are not retained outside the loop, we focus on the state of `i` and `t`.

Output State: **i is equal to n, and t remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations are complete, the loop counter `i` will have reached the value `n`, and the total number of test cases `t` will remain the same as it was initially.
