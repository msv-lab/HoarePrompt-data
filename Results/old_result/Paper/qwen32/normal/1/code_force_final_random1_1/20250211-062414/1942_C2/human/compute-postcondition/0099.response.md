Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `ii` is incremented by 2; `tmp` is either an empty list or contains `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`; `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is false, or `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the condition is true; the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2; if the condition is true, `y` is adjusted to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` and `tmp` is updated accordingly.**
