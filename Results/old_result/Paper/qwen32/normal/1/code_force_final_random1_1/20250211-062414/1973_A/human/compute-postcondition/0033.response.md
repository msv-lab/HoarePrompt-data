The given Python code snippet appends `-1` to the list `resultats`. This action does not affect any other variables except `resultats`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`, `resultats`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` retain their original values. Only `resultats` is modified by having `-1` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, and `resultats` now includes an additional element `-1`.**
