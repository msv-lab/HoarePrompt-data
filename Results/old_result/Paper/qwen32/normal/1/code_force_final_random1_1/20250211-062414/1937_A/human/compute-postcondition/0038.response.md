To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(2 ** power)`, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **Variable `n_cases`:** It is mentioned to be greater than 0, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
3. **Variable `n`:** It is defined as the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`. This means `n` is the highest power of 2 such that 2^n ≤ t.
4. **Variable `power`:** It is initially set to `n` but has been decremented by 1. Therefore, `power = n - 1`.
5. **Condition `(power == n)`:** This condition is explicitly stated to be false, confirming that `power` is indeed `n - 1`.

Given these points, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** (n - 1)`.

Since `n` is the largest integer such that 2^n ≤ t, `2 ** (n - 1)` would be half of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `t`.

Thus, the value printed by the statement `print(2 ** power)` will be `2 ** (n - 1)`, where `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`.

Output: **2 ** (n - 1) (where n is the base-2 logarithm of t)**
