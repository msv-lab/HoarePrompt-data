The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is already calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `L` initially contains only one element which is also `(n + 1) // 2`, after appending `m` to `L`, `L` will now contain two identical elements, both being `(n + 1) // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
