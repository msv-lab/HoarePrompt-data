Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
