To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop condition is `while n:` which means the loop will continue as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is reduced by `(n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is `input_k`
- `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2]`
- `tot` is `0`
- `pow` is `1`
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

We need to ensure that `n` is not zero so that the loop can execute one more time. Since `n` is reduced by `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than zero after this reduction.

Let's analyze the reduction:
- If `n` was initially greater than 1, then `(n + 1) // 2` will be at least 1, and `n` will be reduced but still remain positive.
- If `n` was initially 1, then `(n + 1) // 2` will be 1, and `n` will become 0, which would terminate the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
