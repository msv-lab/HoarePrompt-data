Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the condition of the if statement holds. Otherwise, either `b[0]` is even, or `b[0]` is odd and `b[1]` is equal to `b[0] + 2`. Additionally, either `b[-1]` is even, or `b[-1]` is odd and `b[-2]` is equal to `b[-1] + 2`.**
