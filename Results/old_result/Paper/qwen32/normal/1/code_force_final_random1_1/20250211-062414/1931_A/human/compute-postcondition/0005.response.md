Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is equal to `t` and `n` is greater than 52.
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `word` is an empty string.

Code Snippet:
```python
word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
```

Impact Analysis:
- `n` is greater than 52, so `n - 53` will be a negative index when accessing `alphabet`. Since Python allows negative indexing, `alphabet[n - 53]` will access characters from the end of the string.
- Specifically, `alphabet[-1]` is 'z', `alphabet[-2]` is 'y', and so on. Given `n` > 52, `n - 53` will range from -1 to -48 (since `n` can be at most 100).
- For example, if `n` is 53, `n - 53` is 0, which corresponds to 'a'. If `n` is 54, `n - 53` is 1, which corresponds to 'b', and so forth.
- `word` is initially an empty string. After executing the line, `word` will be updated to include the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by 'zz'.

Output State Calculation:
- Since `n` is greater than 52, `n - 53` will be a valid index into `alphabet` (considering negative indexing).
- The character at position `n - 53` in `alphabet` will be appended to `word`, followed by 'zz'.
- The exact character depends on the value of `n`.

For example:
- If `n` is 53, `word` becomes 'azz'.
- If `n` is 54, `word` becomes 'bzz'.
- If `n` is 100, `word` becomes 'xzz'.

Generalizing, the character added to `word` is `alphabet[n - 53]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is equal to `t` and `n` is greater than 52, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**
