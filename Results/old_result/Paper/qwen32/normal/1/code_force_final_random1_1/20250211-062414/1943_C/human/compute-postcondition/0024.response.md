To determine the output state, we need to consider what `func_1(d)` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it takes the list `d` as input and returns some value `b`. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only state that `b` will be whatever `func_1(d)` computes.

Given this, the only change in the output state is the introduction of the variable `b` which holds the return value of `func_1(d)`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, and `previous`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` for all other vertices `i`, calculated using the doubled values in `a`; `previous` is a list containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex `i`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.
