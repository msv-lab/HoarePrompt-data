Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is 3. If `i` were 0 and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` would contain at least one element which is `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` is either `[]` or contains elements based on the conditions given plus the new element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. In all other cases, `array2` remains unchanged.**
