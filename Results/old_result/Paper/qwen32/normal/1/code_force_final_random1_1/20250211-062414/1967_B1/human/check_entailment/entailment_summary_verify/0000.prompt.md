You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value `ans` based on the given logic. The value `ans` is derived by iteratively adjusting `n` and `m` according to the rules defined within the function until a certain condition is met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. For each test case, initialize `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
2. While `count` is less than or equal to `m`, do the following:
   - Calculate `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - Compute `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, break out of the loop.
   - Subtract `countmins` from `g`.
   - Add the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1 to `ans`.
   - Increment `count` by 1.
3. Print the final value of `ans`.

### Potential Issues
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's consider the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\):

- The code does not explicitly compute the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\).
- The logic used to compute `ans` does not align with the condition specified in the problem description.

### Counterexample
Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

#### Test Case
```
1
2 3
```

#### Expected Output
```
3
```
Explanation:
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)

#### Actual Output of Provided Code
The provided code will not produce the correct output for this test case because it does not properly account for the gcd condition.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis and the counterexample, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program fails to correctly implement the logic required to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It uses an incorrect approach to calculate the number of valid pairs, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
