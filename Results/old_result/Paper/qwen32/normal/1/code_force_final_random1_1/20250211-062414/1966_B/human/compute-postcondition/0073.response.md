To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the variable `i` is used in the loop head, and the range is defined by `n - 1`. Therefore, the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1.
2. The initial value of `i` before entering the loop is not directly relevant to the loop executing, as `i` is set to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, `tc`, `impossible`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the given constraints.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. `impossible` is True, and `ans` is 'NO'**
