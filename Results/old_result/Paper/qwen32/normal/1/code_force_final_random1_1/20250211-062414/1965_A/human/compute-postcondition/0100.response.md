Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, and `j` is 2. Since the condition `j % 2 == 1` is false (as `j` is 2), the else part is executed, which does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, or `j`.**
