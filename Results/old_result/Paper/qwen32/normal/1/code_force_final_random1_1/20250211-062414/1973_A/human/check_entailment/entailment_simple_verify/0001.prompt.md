You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

        if total_points % 2 != 0:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points (`total_points`) as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - Since each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw), `total_points` must be even. If it's not, the program correctly appends `-1` to the results list.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`.
   - This is correct because each match contributes 2 points.

3. **Validation of Total Matches**:
   - The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3. This check seems unnecessary since the maximum number of matches among three players can theoretically be more than 3 (for example, if each pair plays multiple games).
   - However, the program also checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is a valid check because `p3` cannot exceed the total number of matches played.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) using the formula: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is intended to isolate the points contributed by draws. Here's how it works:
     - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p2`, which must come from wins (since draws would give equal points to both players).
     - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p1`, which again must come from wins.
     - Subtracting these from `total_points` leaves only the points from draws.
   - The program then divides `egalites` by 2 to get the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.

5. **Final Check for Draws**:
   - The program checks if `egalites` is less than 0. If it is, it means the calculated points from draws are invalid, and the program appends `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results list.

### Issues Found:
- The check `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect and should be removed. As mentioned earlier, the maximum number of matches is not limited to 3.
- The logic for calculating draws is correct, but the implementation needs to ensure that the conditions leading to `-1` are properly handled.

### Corrected Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the function without the unnecessary check:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0 or egalites % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains an unnecessary check that incorrectly limits the number of matches. After removing this check and ensuring the final validation for draws is correct, the program should work as intended.

However, based on the provided code without modifications, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
