### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem where Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` and the goal is to determine the final score, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been moved from `a` to `c` according to their optimal strategies.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Simulating the Game:**
   - The variable `start` is initialized to 0.
   - A set `vis` is used to keep track of the numbers that have been added to `c`.
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as the count of the current `start` value in `nums` is greater than 0.
     - It adds `start` to the set `vis`.
     - It decreases the count of `start` in `nums`.
     - If the count of `start + 1` is greater than 0, it decreases the count of `start + 1` in `nums` and increments `start`.
     - If the count of `start + 1` is 0, it breaks out of the loop and prints `start + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `start + 1` if it exits the loop due to the absence of `start + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `start` after the loop.

### Analysis:

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The strategy implemented here ensures that Alice and Bob are effectively "competing" for the smallest numbers in the array.
  - By decrementing the counts of `start` and `start + 1` alternately, the program simulates the process of picking elements from `a` and adding them to `c`.
  - The loop stops when there are no more occurrences of `start + 1`, meaning that `start` is the largest number such that all numbers from 0 to `start` are present in `c`.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly calculates the MEX by ensuring that all numbers from 0 to `start` are present in `c` and `start + 1` is not.
  - The use of `Counter` and the alternating decrement of counts effectively simulates the game as described.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the final score of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
