To determine what will be printed by the `print('Alice')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current `print` statement directly.

2. **`n`**: An integer read from the input.
   - This variable represents the number of elements in the list `l`.

3. **`l`**: A map object containing integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where each \(a_i\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - This map object contains `n` integers, each within the specified range.

4. **`lis`**: A sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
   - This list is derived from `l` by removing duplicates and sorting the remaining integers.

5. **`test`**: A boolean value that is `True` if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.
   - This boolean is determined by checking the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `lis`.

6. **`j`**: The length of `lis`.
   - This integer represents the number of unique elements in the original list `l`.

7. **`i`**: Incremented by 1.
   - This variable is incremented by 1, but it does not affect the current `print` statement directly.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The provided code snippet is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Conclusion:

Since the `print` statement is independent of the variables and their values, the output will always be the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
