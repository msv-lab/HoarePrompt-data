Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list. Additionally, at the current index `i`, `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0.**
