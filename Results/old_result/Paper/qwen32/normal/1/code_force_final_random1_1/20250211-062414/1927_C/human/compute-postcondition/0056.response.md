The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified later in the code.

Given the initial state, the only variables affected by this code snippet are `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers representing the counts as per the loop logic; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is `k + 1`. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the condition in the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition in the if statement is not satisfied.**
