To determine what will be printed by the `print(i + 1, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and identify the value of the variable `i`.

From the initial state, we have the following information:
- `l` is equal to 0.
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`.
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`.
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`.
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`.
- `r = 2`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`.
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

However, there is no explicit mention of the variable `i` in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, it's impossible to determine its exact value based on the information provided.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that the output will depend on the value of `i`, which is not specified. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific numerical output.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is an undefined variable in the given context)**
