Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**

Explanation: The value of `z` is updated to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to (but not including) index `n - y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
