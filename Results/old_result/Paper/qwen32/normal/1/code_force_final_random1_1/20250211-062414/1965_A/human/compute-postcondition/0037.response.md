Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 included and length greater than 1; `test` is True, indicating no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1; `j` is equal to the length of `lis`; the length of `lis` is even**
