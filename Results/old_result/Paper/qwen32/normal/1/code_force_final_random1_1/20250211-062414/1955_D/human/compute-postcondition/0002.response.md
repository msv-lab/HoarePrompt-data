In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer input, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input function returns this value. Since the loop head does not involve `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `max_val`, or `cnt_b`, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input function returns `t`**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times as intended.
