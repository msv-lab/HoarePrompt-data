Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1
- `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be at least 2
- `count` is 2
- `ans` is `n`
- `i` is 1
- `countmins` is 1
- `g` is `n // 2 - 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
ans += int(g / count) + 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value.

Calculating the New Value of `ans`:
- `g` is `n // 2 - 1`
- `count` is 2
- `int(g / count)` computes the integer division of `g` by `count`
- `int(g / count) + 1` adds 1 to the result of the integer division

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
