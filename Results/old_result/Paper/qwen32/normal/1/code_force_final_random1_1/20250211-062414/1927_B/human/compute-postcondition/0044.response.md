Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes a string where each character corresponds to the position (1-based index) of the count of the first occurrence of each element in the reversed list `a`, mapped to characters from 'a' to 'z'. The function prints this string for each test case.**
