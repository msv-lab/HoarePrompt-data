The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `t` and the initial list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**
