To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `word` is an empty string

Let's break down the code:
- `alphabet[n - 53]`: This expression accesses a character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `n - 53` must be within the range 0 to 25 (inclusive) to access a valid character. This implies that `n` should be between 53 and 78 (inclusive).
- `word += ...`: This appends the result of the expression to the `word` string.

Given these points, the new value of `word` will be the character at position `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'.

Therefore, the updated `word` will be `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.

Since `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` are not modified by the code snippet, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**
