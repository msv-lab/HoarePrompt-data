The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, `z`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `i` was incremented by 1 before the code snippet, so its value is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `a` is greater than 0, `z` is an integer such that 0 ≤ z ≤ 50, `m` is an integer equal to 15 * z - 4 * y, `i` is incremented by 1**.
