You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It sorts the list and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2). It then prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `2n` positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform `n` moves.
- In each move, we choose two integers `x` and `y`, add `min(x, y)` to our score, and erase `x` and `y`.
- We aim to maximize the final score after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program sorts the list of integers and then sums up every second element starting from the first element. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Summing**: It then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first element (`l[0], l[2], l[4], ...`) and adds these to the score.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Optimal Strategy**: By sorting the list and summing every second element starting from the first, the program ensures that we are always picking the smallest available elements in pairs. This strategy maximizes the score because choosing smaller elements first ensures that we are adding the largest possible minimum values to the score.
- **Edge Cases**: Let's consider a few edge cases:
  - **Single Pair**: For `n=1`, the program correctly picks the smaller of the two numbers.
  - **Multiple Pairs**: For larger `n`, the program consistently picks the smallest available elements, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
  - **Identical Elements**: If all elements are identical, the program still works correctly as it will sum up the same value `n` times.
  - **Distinct Elements**: If all elements are distinct, the program will pair the smallest elements together, maximizing the score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. It handles all the edge cases and provides the maximum final score for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the list of integers and sums up every second element starting from the first element. This approach ensures that we are always adding the largest possible minimum values to the score, thus maximizing the final score. The program handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for every test case.
