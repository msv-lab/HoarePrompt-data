Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1), `line[1]`: (i, 1) if `line[1]` is not '..', `line[2]`: (i, 2)}; if `isPlayer(line[1])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[1]: False}`; if `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)`; if `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. Additionally, if `line[1][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; `ind` is 2; if `line[2][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 2)`.**
