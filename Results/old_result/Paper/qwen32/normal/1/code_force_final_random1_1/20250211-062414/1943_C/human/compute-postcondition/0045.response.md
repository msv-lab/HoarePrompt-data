The variable `ci` is assigned the value of `len(path_ba) // 2`. Given that the length of `path_ba` is odd, `len(path_ba) // 2` will yield the middle index of the list (integer division rounds down). The other variables (`path_ba` and `ops`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.**
