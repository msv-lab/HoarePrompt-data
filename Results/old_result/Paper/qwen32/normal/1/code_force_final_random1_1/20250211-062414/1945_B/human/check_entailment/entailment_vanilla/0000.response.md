Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch. We need to calculate the maximum overlap of visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Visibility Period**: A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m`.
2. **Overlap Calculation**: To maximize the number of fireworks seen at the same time, we need to consider the visibility periods of fireworks launched at different times.
3. **Critical Time Point**: The critical point to check is `min(a, b) + m`, because beyond this point, fireworks from both installations would have started their visibility periods multiple times, and we need to count the overlaps up to this point.

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible up to `min(a, b) + m`. This is given by `(min(a, b) + m) // a`.
- Similarly, calculate the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible up to `min(a, b) + m`. This is given by `(min(a, b) + m) // b`.
- If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, there might be an additional overlap at the exact `min(a, b) + m` point, which needs to be counted once more. However, this condition seems overly restrictive and not necessary for the general case.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the number of fireworks visible up to `min(a, b) + m` for both installations and sums them up. It also includes an additional condition to add 1 if `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. This additional condition is not generally correct because it doesn't account for all possible overlaps correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `m = 5`. The critical point is `min(2, 3) + 5 = 7`. The fireworks visible up to this point are:
- From the first installation: at times 2, 4, 6 (3 fireworks).
- From the second installation: at times 3, 6 (2 fireworks).
- Total fireworks visible at the same time: 3 (at time 6).

However, the provided solution would incorrectly add an extra 1 due to the condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` being false, but it doesn't handle the overlap correctly in other scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there are overlaps that are not captured by the additional condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
