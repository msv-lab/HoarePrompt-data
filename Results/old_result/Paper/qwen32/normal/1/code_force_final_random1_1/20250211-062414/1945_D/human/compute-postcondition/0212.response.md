The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements in the list `custos`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `c` and how it relates to the elements in `custos`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `custos` was `[120, 140]`, and `c` would have taken the value `120` during that iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` should now take the value of the next element in the list, which is `140`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`custos` is a list with at least one element, currently `custos = [120, 140]`, `c` is 140**
