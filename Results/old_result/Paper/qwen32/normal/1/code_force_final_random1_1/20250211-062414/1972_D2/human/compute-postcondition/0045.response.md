To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 10
- `m` is at least 15
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is 3 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment)

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - For the loop to continue, `15 <= n` must be true. Since `n` is at least 10, this condition is not guaranteed to be true unless `n` is at least 15.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - For the loop to continue, `10 <= m` must be true. Since `m` is at least 15, this condition is already satisfied.

Since the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n` is not guaranteed to be true with the current values, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 15 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

No other variables (`x`, `y`, or `m`) need to be adjusted because:
- `x` and `y` are not changed within the loop body according to the problem statement.
- `m` already satisfies its condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be at least 15, `m` is at least 15, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is 3**
