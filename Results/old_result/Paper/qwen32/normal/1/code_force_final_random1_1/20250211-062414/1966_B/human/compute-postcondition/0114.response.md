Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`, `ans` is 'NO', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and `impossible` is True.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `ans` has been updated to 'NO'. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
