To determine the output state, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state:

- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is greater than 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

The function call `func_1(b, a % b)` suggests that `func_1` is likely implementing some form of recursive algorithm, possibly related to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, without the definition of `func_1`, we can only assume that it returns two values, `c` and `d`.

Given the return statement `return d, c - a // b * d`, we need to express the final output in terms of `c` and `d`.

Let's denote:
- The first part of the return statement as `d`.
- The second part of the return statement as `c - a // b * d`.

Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, which means it gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`.

Thus, the output state can be described as:
- The first value returned is `d`.
- The second value returned is `c - (a // b) * d`.

Output State: **The program returns `d` and `c - (a // b) * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`**.
