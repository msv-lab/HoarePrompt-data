Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing one element `a[0]`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is 'L'**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
