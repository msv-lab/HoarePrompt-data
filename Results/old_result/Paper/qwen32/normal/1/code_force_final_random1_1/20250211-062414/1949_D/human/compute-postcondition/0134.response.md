The given code snippet appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` will now include the additional character from the specified position in the list `xx`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `nx` originally contained a string that was either 'F' or 'S' based on certain conditions, or it was an empty string followed by characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` was not '?'.
- After executing the line `nx += xx[i][j - 1]`, `nx` will have the original value of `nx` plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string that includes its original value plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. `j` is `j + 1`.**
