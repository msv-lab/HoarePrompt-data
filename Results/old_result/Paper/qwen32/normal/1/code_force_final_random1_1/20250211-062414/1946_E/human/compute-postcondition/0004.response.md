To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(b, a)` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can infer that `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is greater than 0.
- `a` is less than `b`.

After executing `c, d = func_1(b, a)`, the values of `c` and `d` will depend on the implementation of `func_1`. But we know that `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is greater than 0, `a` is less than `b`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`**.
