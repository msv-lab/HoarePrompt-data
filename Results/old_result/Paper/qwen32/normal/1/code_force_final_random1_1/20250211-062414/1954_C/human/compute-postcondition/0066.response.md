To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while i < len(a):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment).
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length (these variables are not part of the loop condition, so they don't need adjustment).
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment).
- `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[j]` which is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j ≤ i` and `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])` (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment).
- `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[j]` which is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j ≤ i-1` and `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])` (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment).
- `i` is 1 (this variable is part of the loop condition, so it might need adjustment).
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line (this variable is part of the loop condition, so it might need adjustment).
- `new2[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])` (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need adjustment).

From the above analysis, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[j]` which is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j ≤ i` and `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[j]` which is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j ≤ i-1` and `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line with length greater than 1; `new2[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`**
