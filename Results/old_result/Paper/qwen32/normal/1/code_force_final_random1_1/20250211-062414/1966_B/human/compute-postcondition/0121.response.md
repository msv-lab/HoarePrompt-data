To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is `for i in range(n - 1):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. However, since `i` is already `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop condition `i < n-1` would no longer be satisfied, meaning the loop would terminate.

Therefore, to make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` such that it is less than `n-1` at the start of the next iteration. Specifically, `i` should be reset to its initial value, which is `0`.

No other variables (`n`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, `tc`, `ans`, `impossible`) can be adjusted according to the problem constraints.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`, `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the `m-1`-th character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the `m-1`-th character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'NO'. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and `impossible` is True.**
