The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `x` are lists of integers, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will be updated with the new values read from the input, while `a`, `x`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
