The code snippet assigns the value `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to the variable `s`. This means `s` now holds the difference between the cumulative sum at index `b` and the cumulative sum just before index `a` in the list `p`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except for `s` which is newly defined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
