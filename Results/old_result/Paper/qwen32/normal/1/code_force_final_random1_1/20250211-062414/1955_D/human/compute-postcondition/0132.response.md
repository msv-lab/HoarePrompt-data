Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 1 because `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and its value is now non-negative. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, and `ans` is updated accordingly.**
