The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This affects the values of `a` and `b`, but does not change the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `p` is `[0] + [cumulative sums of elements in l]`, `c` is `[0] + [cumulative counts of 1s in l]`, `i` is the sum of all elements in l, `j` is the count of 1s in l, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**.

In simpler terms: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two integers read from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
