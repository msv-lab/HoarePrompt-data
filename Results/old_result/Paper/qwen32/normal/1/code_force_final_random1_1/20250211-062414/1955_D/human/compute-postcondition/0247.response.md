To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables. The loop iterates over each element in `b_values` and sets the corresponding value in `cnt_b` to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables outside of `cnt_b`.

Given the provided information:
- `b_values` contains indices that will be used to access `cnt_b`.
- For each iteration, `cnt_b[i]` is set to 0, where `i` is an element from `b_values`.

After all iterations, every index in `b_values` will have its corresponding value in `cnt_b` set to 0.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, all elements in `cnt_b` that correspond to the indices listed in `b_values` will be set to 0.
