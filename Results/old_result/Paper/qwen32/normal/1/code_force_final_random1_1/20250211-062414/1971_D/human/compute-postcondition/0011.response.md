Postcondition: **`t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2; `count` is 2; `flag` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 0; the character at position `j` in `s` is different from the character at position `j + 1`.**
