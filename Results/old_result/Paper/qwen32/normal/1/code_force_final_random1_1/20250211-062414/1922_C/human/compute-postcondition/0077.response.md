The code snippet modifies the dictionary `d2` by setting the value at key `n - 1` to `1`. This does not affect the other variables `i`, `n`, `l`, or `d1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same input integer, `l` is the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1`.**
