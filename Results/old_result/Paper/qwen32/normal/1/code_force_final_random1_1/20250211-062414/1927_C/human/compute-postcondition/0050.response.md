Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers representing the counts as per the loop logic; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is `k + 1`. At this point, `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`.**
