To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop continues as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.

Let's check the conditions with the current values of `x` and `y`:
1. `(x + y) * x = (1 + 2) * 1 = 3`
2. `(x + y) * y = (1 + 2) * 2 = 6`

For the loop to continue executing, both `3 <= n` and `6 <= m` must be true. 

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, we need to adjust these values to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

- Since `(x + y) * x = 3`, `n` must be at least 3.
- Since `(x + y) * y = 6`, `m` must be at least 6.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 3 and `m` is at least 6.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
