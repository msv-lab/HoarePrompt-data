To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop logic and how it progresses through the iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over indices `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1` with a step of 2 (`for i in range(1, n, 2)`).
- For each iteration, it checks two conditions:
  1. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`.
  2. If `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.

- If either condition is true, the loop prints "No" and breaks.
- If neither condition is true for any iteration, the loop completes all iterations and prints "Yes".

### Iteration Details:
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), the loop checks `a[1]` against `b[2]` and `b[0]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 3`), the loop checks `a[3]` against `b[4]` and `b[2]`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 5`), the loop checks `a[5]` against `b[6]` and `b[4]`.

### Generalization:
- The loop will continue to check pairs of indices `(i, i+1)` and `(i, i-1)` as long as the conditions are not met.
- The loop will iterate until it either finds a pair that meets the conditions or completes all iterations.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without finding any pair that meets the conditions, it will print "Yes".
- If any pair meets the conditions during the iterations, it will print "No" and terminate early.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the nature of the loop, the final output state depends on whether the conditions inside the loop are ever met during the iterations.

**Output State: **The loop will print "Yes" if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are true for any `i` in the range `[1, n-1, 2]`. Otherwise, it will print "No" and terminate early.**

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `a` and `b`, we can only conclude based on the general behavior of the loop. Therefore, the final output state is dependent on the specific values of `a` and `b`.

However, if we assume that the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output state would be:

Output State: **Yes**
