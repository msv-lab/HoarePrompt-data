Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the situation:

Initial State: `final` is [1, 3]. However, the length of `final` is 0.

This statement seems contradictory because if `final` is [1, 3], its length cannot be 0. We'll assume the initial state should be interpreted as `final` being an empty list `[]` since the length is specified as 0.

Code Snippet:
```python
c1 = o * 100 // n
```

The variables `o` and `n` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. However, the code calculates `c1` based on these variables.

Since the values of `o` and `n` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `c1`. But we know that `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.

Output State: **`final` is [], `c1` is `o * 100 // n`**.

Natural Language Explanation: The list `final` remains an empty list. The variable `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, where `o` and `n` are undefined variables.
