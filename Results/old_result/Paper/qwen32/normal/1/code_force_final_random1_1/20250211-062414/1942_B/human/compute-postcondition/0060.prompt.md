Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from the end of `ar` to the beginning, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
