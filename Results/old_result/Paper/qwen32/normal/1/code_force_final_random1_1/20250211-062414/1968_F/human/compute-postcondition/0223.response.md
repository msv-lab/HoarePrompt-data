Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` remains the same, `results` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `pf` remains the same, `mp` remains the same, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` remains the same.**

Explanation: The variable `it1` is updated to the position where the value `l` would be inserted into the list `v1` to keep `v1` sorted. All other variables retain their initial values.
