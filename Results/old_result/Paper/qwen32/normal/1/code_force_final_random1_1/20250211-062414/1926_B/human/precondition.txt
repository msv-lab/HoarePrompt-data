t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
