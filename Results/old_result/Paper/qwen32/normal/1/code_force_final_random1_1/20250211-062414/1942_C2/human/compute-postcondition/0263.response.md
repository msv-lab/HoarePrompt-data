The only object in the loop head is the variable `gap`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `gap` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `x`
- `ans` is incremented by `gap`
- `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted
- `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted
- `gap` is the first element in `odd`
- If `y < gap // 2`, `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `y` is now `y - gap // 2`

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `gap` should be updated to the next element in the `odd` list.

State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented by `gap`, `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted, `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted, `gap` is the next element in `odd`**
