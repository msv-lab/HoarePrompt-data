### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-examine the problem statement and the provided program to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This indeed simplifies to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]
where \(a_1\) is the smallest element and \(a_n\) is the largest element in the sorted array. This is because all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the length of the array \( n \).
   - Reads the array elements.
   - Sorts the array.
   - Prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

This aligns perfectly with the simplified formula for beauty, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array.

#### Verification:
Given the function summary, the program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array and computes their difference, which is the maximum possible beauty of the array.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: \(69 - 69 = 0\)
   - Output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: \(100 - 43 = 57\)
   - Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: \(4 - 3 = 1\)
   - Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
   - Output: `1`

All outputs match the expected results, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

**Final:** **True**
