To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to consider the current values of the relevant variables and how they are affected by the operation.

Given:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `l = 0`
- `r = 2`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`
- `l` is not equal to 0, and `a = 3`
- If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b = 2 * i`

We need to compute the new value of `b` using the formula:
```
b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `r = 2`
- `idx_B[r] = idx_B[2] = 0`
- `l = 0`

Let's assume `i` is a variable that has some value, but since `l` is 0, the term `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` will always be 0 regardless of the value of `i`.

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
```
b = b + 0
```
which means `b` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables except that we need to specify the value of `b` if it was initially defined. Since `b` was initially set to `2 * i` (assuming `i` was defined somewhere before this snippet), we will keep that definition.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, and `a = 3`. `b` is `2 * i`.**
