To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables evolve over time.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `t`: Input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4.
  - `n`: 0.
  - `k`: Input integer.
  - `L`: List of successive halvings of `n`, rounded up.
  - `tot`: 0.
  - `pow`: 1.

- **Loop Body:**
  - For each element `a` in `L`:
    - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, print `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
    - Increment `tot` by `a`.
    - Multiply `pow` by 2.

### Observations from Given Outputs:
- The list `L` contains the successive halvings of `n`, rounded up. Since `n` starts at 0, the list `L` will always be `[1]` because the halving of 0 is still 0, but since we round up, it becomes 1.
- The loop runs only once because `L` has only one element.

### Final Output State:
Since `L` contains only one element (`[1]`), the loop will execute exactly once. Let's summarize the state after this single iteration:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is an input parameter.
- `n`: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `k`: Remains unchanged as it is an input parameter.
- `L`: Remains `[1]` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `tot`: Initially 0, after the loop, `tot` becomes `tot + a` = 0 + 1 = 1.
- `pow`: Initially 1, after the loop, `pow` becomes `pow * 2` = 1 * 2 = 2.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute only once due to the nature of `L` being `[1]`. After this execution, the state of the variables will be as described above.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the variable `tot` will be 1, `pow` will be 2, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `L`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
