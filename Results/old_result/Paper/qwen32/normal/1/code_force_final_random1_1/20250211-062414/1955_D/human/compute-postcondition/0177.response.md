Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; `curr` is the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing; `cnt_b` has its counts incremented by 1 for each element `b[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `m-1`; `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code snippet only updates `b_values` by converting the list `b` into a set of its unique elements. All other variables retain their initial states and values.
