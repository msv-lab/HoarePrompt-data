To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`: This is a list of integers.
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`: This is another list of integers.
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`: This is a list of integers identical to `A`.
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`: This is another list of integers.
- `n` is greater than 0: This indicates that `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`: This suggests that there is a list `s` where each element is either `'>'` or something else.
- `i` is incremented by 1: This means that `i` starts from some value and is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement is executed.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the result of the expression `n - i`.
- Since the exact value of `n` and the starting value of `i` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `n - i`.
- However, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 before this `print` statement is executed, so the value of `i` used in the expression `n - i` is one more than its initial value.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can say that the output will be the value of `n - i` where `i` has been incremented by 1.

Output: **n - i (where i has been incremented by 1)**
