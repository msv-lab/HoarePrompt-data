Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the new list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `a` will be a list where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the final value it takes during the last iteration of the loop. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged as per their initial definitions.
