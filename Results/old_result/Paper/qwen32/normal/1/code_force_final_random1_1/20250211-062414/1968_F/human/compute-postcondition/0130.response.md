Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line such that `data[idx - 3 - n]` is a positive integer, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element being `''`, and the last element being `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise `results` remains unchanged with `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are integers from `data` starting at the position `idx - n - 2` up to `idx - 3`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element from index `1` to `n` contains the prefix XOR value, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the position where `l` would fit in `v1` if `v1` were sorted. `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Additionally, either `it1` is not less than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`.**
