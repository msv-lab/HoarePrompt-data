Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee that no matter the order in which the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. The logic used to assign 'F' or 'S' to '?' positions is flawed and does not take into account the constraint on consecutive videos effectively.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Assignment Logic**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' based on whether the index is in the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor\) elements of `sa` or `sb`. This does not ensure that the constraint on consecutive videos is met. It simply distributes 'F' and 'S' without considering the sequence of transitions.

2. **Handling Undecided Videos**: The program does not handle the assignment of undecided videos ('?') in a way that respects the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. It uses a simple heuristic that does not guarantee correctness.

3. **Lack of Backtracking or Validation**: The program does not validate the final assignment to ensure that the constraint is satisfied for all possible permutations of scenarios. It also does not backtrack or adjust assignments if an invalid configuration is detected.

To fix these issues, a more sophisticated approach would be needed, possibly involving backtracking or dynamic programming to ensure that the constraint is satisfied for all permutations of scenarios. However, implementing such an approach is complex and beyond the scope of this simple code review.

Thus, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.
