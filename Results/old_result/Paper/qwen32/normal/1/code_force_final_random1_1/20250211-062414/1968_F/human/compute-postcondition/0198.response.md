The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 2. Therefore, the new value of `idx` will be `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.**
