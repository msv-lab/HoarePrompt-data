To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range `0` to `2 * n` with a step of `2`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input
- `score` is `2 * l[i_end + 2]`
- `i` is `i_end + 2`

The loop increments `i` by `2` in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

Let's calculate the new value of `i`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_end + 2`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `(i_end + 2) + 2 = i_end + 4`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i_end + 4`**.

Note: The variable `score` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted based on the loop head variables alone. However, if `score` is dependent on `i` in some way outside of what is given, it would need to be recalculated accordingly in the loop body. But based on the information provided, we only adjust `i`.
