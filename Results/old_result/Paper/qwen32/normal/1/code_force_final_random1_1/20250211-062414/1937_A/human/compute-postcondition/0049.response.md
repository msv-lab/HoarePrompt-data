Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(4 < t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 3, `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The value of `power` was initially 2 and it is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
