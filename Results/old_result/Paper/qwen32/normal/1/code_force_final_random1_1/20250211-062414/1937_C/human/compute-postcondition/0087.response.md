To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is the previous value of `n` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `i` is the previous value of `n`.
- `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<'.
- `res` is the user input.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had the value of the previous `n`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The loop variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop increments `i` automatically in each iteration.
2. The variable `n` should remain the same as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1` (which is the previous `n + 1`).
- `n` will remain the same.

Since the other variables (`t`, `k`, `best`, and `res`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the previous value of `n` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `i` is the previous value of `n` + 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', `res` is the user input.**
