The code snippet sets `cur` to 0, which changes its value from whatever it was before to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.**
