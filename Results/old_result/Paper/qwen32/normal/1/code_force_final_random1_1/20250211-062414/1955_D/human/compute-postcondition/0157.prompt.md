Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is the number of elements in the first `m` elements of `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing; `cnt_b` has its counts decremented for each occurrence of elements from `a` that are in `b`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is 2 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 1. `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and its value is now non-negative. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, and `ans` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was initially non-negative, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` or `curr`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[4 + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[4 + m]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[4 + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[4 + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is 4. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
