Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`; `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `v` is a list containing the elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input where `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`; `i` is 1; `v` is a list containing the elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`; `l` is 0; `m` is `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is the index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input where `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`; `i` is 1; `v` is a list containing the elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`; `l` is 1; `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is the index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program does nothing further regarding the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input where `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`; `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`; `i` is 1; `v` is a list containing the elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`; `l` is 2; `m` is `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is the index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
