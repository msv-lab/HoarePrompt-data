The code assigns `tmp` the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `tmp` will be assigned the character `'a'`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `i` remains 0.
- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` remain the integers read from the input.
- `s` remains the non-empty string read from the input.
- `cnt` remains the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` remains either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters with the condition that `cur & 1 << i` equals 0.
- `ans` remains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `tmp` is now `'a'`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters with the condition that `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `tmp` is `'a'`.**
