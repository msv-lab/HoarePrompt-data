To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `i <= k`. The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `k`.

Given:
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `k` is an integer read from the input.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i <= k` must be true when the loop starts. Since `i` is already initialized to 1, `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` because it is already set to 1. However, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1**
