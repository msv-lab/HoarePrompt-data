To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Expression:**
   - The expression uses tuple indexing. It evaluates the condition `c < b % 3` and uses the result (`True` or `False`) to index into the tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it selects the first element of the tuple, which is `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, it selects the second element of the tuple, which is `-1`.

2. **Evaluating the Condition:**
   - `b % 3` computes the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - `c < b % 3` checks if `c` is less than this remainder.

3. **Evaluating the Tuple Elements:**
   - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart.
     - `b // 3` performs integer division of `b` by 3, which means it divides `b` by 3 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
   - `-1` is a constant value.

### Final Output Determination:

- **If `c < b % 3` is `True`:**
  - The expression evaluates to `a + b // 3`.
  
- **If `c < b % 3` is `False`:**
  - The expression evaluates to `-1`.

### Given Information:

- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`.
- `b` is modified to `b + c` before the `print` statement is executed.

### Conclusion:

The output of the `print` statement depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, it depends on whether `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3 after `b` has been incremented by `c`.

Given the initial state and the transformation applied to `b`, the final output can be described as follows:

- If `c < (b + c) % 3`, the output is `a + (b + c) // 3`.
- Otherwise, the output is `-1`.

Thus, the precise output cannot be determined without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, but we can describe the conditions under which each case occurs.

Output: **a + (b + c) // 3 if c < (b + c) % 3, otherwise -1**
