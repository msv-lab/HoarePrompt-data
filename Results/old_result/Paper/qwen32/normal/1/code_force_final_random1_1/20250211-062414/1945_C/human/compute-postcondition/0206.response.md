Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing the element `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is less than 50. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The list `final` initially contained no elements. After executing `final.append(n)`, `final` now contains the single element `n`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged as it was defined as `o * 100 // n` and is still less than 50. All other variables retain their original values.
