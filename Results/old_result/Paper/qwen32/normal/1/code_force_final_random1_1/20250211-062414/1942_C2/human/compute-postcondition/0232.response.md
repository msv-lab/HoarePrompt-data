Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`. `odd` is a list containing `gap`, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]` if `x > 1` or `a[0] + n` if `x == 1`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The current value of `gap` is greater than 1 and odd.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `gap` has been appended to the `odd` list. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
