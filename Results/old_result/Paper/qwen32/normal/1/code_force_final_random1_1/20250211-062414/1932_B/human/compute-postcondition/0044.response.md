Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21, `test` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the integer from the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the list of integers from the second test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is 21.**

Explanation: The `results` list initially contained one element, 0. After executing the code snippet `results.append(current_year)`, the value of `current_year` (which is 21) was appended to the `results` list, making it contain two elements: 0 and 21. All other variables (`test_cases`, `test`, `n`, `a`, and `current_year`) remain unchanged.
