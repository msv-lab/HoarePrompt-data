The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within the range specified by the input. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1440. Since `t` is used as a counter that decreases with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439; `s` is the new string input by the user; `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` does not equal '00' and if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is less than or equal to 12. Otherwise, `h` is greater than 12.**
