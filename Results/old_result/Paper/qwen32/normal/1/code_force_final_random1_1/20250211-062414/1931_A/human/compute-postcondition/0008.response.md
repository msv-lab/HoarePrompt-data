Given the initial state, the value of `n` is greater than 26, and since `n` is equal to `t`, `t` is also greater than 26. The string `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. The variable `word` is initially an empty string.

The code snippet concatenates 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and 'z' to the `word` variable.

Since `n` is greater than 26, `n - 28` will be a negative index. In Python, negative indices count from the end of the string, so `alphabet[n - 28]` is equivalent to `alphabet[-(28 - n)]`. Given that `n` is greater than 26, `28 - n` will be a negative number, making `-(28 - n)` a positive number less than 26. Specifically, `n - 28` will range from -1 to -25 (since `n` ranges from 27 to 100), which corresponds to indices 25 to 1 in the `alphabet` string.

For example, if `n` is 27, `n - 28` is -1, which corresponds to the last character 'z' in the `alphabet` string. If `n` is 28, `n - 28` is -2, which corresponds to the second last character 'y' in the `alphabet` string, and so on.

Thus, the character added to `word` will be the character at the position `26 - (n - 26) = 52 - n` in the `alphabet` string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is equal to `t` and `n` is greater than 26, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[52 - n]` + 'z'**.
