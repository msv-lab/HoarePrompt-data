Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[j]` is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', otherwise all elements of `a` are incremented by 1, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[j]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `j` is `j + 2`.**
