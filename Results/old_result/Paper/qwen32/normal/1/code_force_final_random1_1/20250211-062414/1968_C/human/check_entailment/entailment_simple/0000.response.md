### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and see if it meets the requirements of the problem.

The problem requires us to construct an array \( a \) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

The provided code initializes the first element of the array \( a \) with a fixed value of 1000 and then constructs the rest of the array by adding the corresponding \( x \) values to the previous element of \( a \). Specifically, the code does the following:
- It sets \( a[0] = 1000 \).
- For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \), it sets \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).

Now let's check if this approach guarantees that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \):

- By construction, \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).
- Therefore, \( a[i] \mod a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) \mod a[i-1] = x[i-1] \mod a[i-1] \).
- Since \( x[i-1] < a[i-1] \) (because \( x[i-1] \leq 500 \) and \( a[i-1] \geq 1000 \)), we have \( x[i-1] \mod a[i-1] = x[i-1] \).

Thus, the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) is satisfied for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

Additionally, since \( a[0] = 1000 \) and each subsequent \( a[i] \) is obtained by adding positive integers to the previous element, all elements of \( a \) will be within the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly constructs an array \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
