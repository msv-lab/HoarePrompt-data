The code snippet appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. Given the conditions and the code, the value being appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

Since the condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was previously checked and determined to be true, the code proceeds to append the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

Thus, the updated state includes `array2` now containing one element, which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 1, `array2` contains one element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
