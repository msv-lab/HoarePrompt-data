### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's analyze the provided code:

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the number of valid pairs (x, y) for a single test case with given `n` and `m`.
- **Logic**:
  - It iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
  - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
  - It checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` and if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
  - If these conditions are met, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
  - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It calls `func_1` `t` times, once for each test case.

#### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be attempting to solve the problem but there are some issues:
  - The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not directly checked. Instead, the code seems to be trying to count pairs based on some derived conditions which might not accurately reflect the original problem.
  - The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not clear and does not seem to correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the original condition.
  - The state comment provided (`State: n = 100, m = 100, x = 11, y = 10, cnt = 27.`) and the printed value (`27`) do not match the expected output for the given input (which should be `423` according to the example).

Given the above points, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is `False`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
