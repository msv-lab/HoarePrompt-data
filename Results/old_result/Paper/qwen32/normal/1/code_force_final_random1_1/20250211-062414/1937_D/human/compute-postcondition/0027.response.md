To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step-by-step based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s`: String of '<' and '>'
   - `n`: Length of `s`
   - `A`: Initially empty list
   - `idx_A`: Initially empty list

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each character in `s` from index `0` to `n-1`:
     - If the character is `'>`:
       - If `idx_A` is empty, append `0` to `A`.
       - Otherwise, compute `x` as `A[-1] + (i - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A)` and append `x` to `A`.
       - Append the current index `i` to `idx_A`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the final state of `A` and `idx_A` will be determined by the positions of '>' in the string `s`.

- **`A`**: This list will contain computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`. Each time a '>' is encountered, a new value is calculated and appended to `A` based on the previous value in `A` and the distance from the last encountered '>'.
  
- **`idx_A`**: This list will simply contain the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s = "<<<>>>"` for a concrete example:
- `n = 6`
- Initial state: `A = []`, `idx_A = []`

**Iteration Details**:
- `i = 0`: `s[0] = '<'` → No change
- `i = 1`: `s[1] = '<'` → No change
- `i = 2`: `s[2] = '<'` → No change
- `i = 3`: `s[3] = '>'`
  - `idx_A` is empty, so append `0` to `A`: `A = [0]`
  - Append `3` to `idx_A`: `idx_A = [3]`
- `i = 4`: `s[4] = '>'`
  - Compute `x = A[-1] + (i - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A) = 0 + (4 - 3) * 1 = 1`
  - Append `1` to `A`: `A = [0, 1]`
  - Append `4` to `idx_A`: `idx_A = [3, 4]`
- `i = 5`: `s[5] = '>'`
  - Compute `x = A[-1] + (i - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A) = 1 + (5 - 4) * 2 = 3`
  - Append `3` to `A`: `A = [0, 1, 3]`
  - Append `5` to `idx_A`: `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`

### Final State:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`**

This means that `A` contains the computed values based on the positions of '>' in the string, and `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`.
