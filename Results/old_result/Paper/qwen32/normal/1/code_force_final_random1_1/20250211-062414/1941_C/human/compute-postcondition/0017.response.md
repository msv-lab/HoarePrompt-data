To determine the output of the `print(x + y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly influence the calculation of `x` and `y` in this specific context.
- `a` is the new input integer. However, this variable is not used in the calculation of `x` and `y`, so it can be ignored for this particular print statement.
- `s` is the string input from the user.
- `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`.
- `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`.

The `print(x + y)` statement will output the sum of the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Since the exact content of the string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
