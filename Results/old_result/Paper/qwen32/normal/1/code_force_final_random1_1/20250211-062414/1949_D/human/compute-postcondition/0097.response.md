Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sb` is a list containing the single element `i`. Otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged as an empty list. `sa` remains unchanged as an empty list in both cases.**
