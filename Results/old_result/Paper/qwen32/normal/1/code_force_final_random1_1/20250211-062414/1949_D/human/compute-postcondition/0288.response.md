To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each iteration based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n` (inclusive). For each `j`, it checks the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`:
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, it appends `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, it checks whether `i` or `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4`:
  - If either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]`, it appends `'S'` to `nx`.
  - Otherwise, it appends `'F'` to `nx`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations (from `j = 1` to `j = n`), the string `nx` will be constructed based on the above rules. The variable `i` remains `n` throughout the loop.

### Output State Description:
- `nx` will be a string of length `n`, constructed by appending characters from `xx[n][0]` to `xx[n][n-1]` according to the specified rules.
- `i` will still be `n`.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`nx` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the rules provided, and `i` is `n`.**

In simple terms, `nx` will be a string formed by processing each element in the row `xx[n]` from index `0` to `n-1` as described, and `i` will remain unchanged as `n`.
