The value of `pow` is doubled. Initially, `pow` is `4`, so after the operation `pow *= 2`, `pow` becomes `8`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is `0`, `k` is `input_k`, `L` is `[1]`, `pow` is `8`, and `tot` is `2 * a`.**
