The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. Given the initial state, `na_frente` was previously set to the first integer read from input minus 1, and `pos_final` was set to the second integer read from input minus 2. After executing the code, these variables will now hold the new values read from the input without any modification.

Therefore, the new values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be the integers directly read from the input, and all other variables will retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to 0, `best` is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to `pos_final`**.
