Postcondition: **`data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x` remain the same. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains an additional element `'YES'`. Otherwise, `results` has `'NO'` appended to it.**
