To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `j`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration: `nx` is a string, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is at least 1.
- The loop statement: `for j in range(1, n + 1):`

Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it indicates that the loop involving `i` has already completed. Now, we need to adjust the state for the loop involving `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration of the `j` loop, `j` would have taken on the value `n` (since the range is from 1 to `n` inclusive). For the `j` loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, which is `1` (the starting point of the loop).

Therefore, the state at the start of the `j` loop should be:
- `j` is `1` (the start of the new iteration of the `j` loop).
- `nx`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
