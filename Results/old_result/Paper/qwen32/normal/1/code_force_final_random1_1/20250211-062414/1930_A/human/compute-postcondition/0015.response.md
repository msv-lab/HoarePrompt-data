The given code snippet sets the variable `score` to 0. This action overrides the previous value of `score`, which was the sum of elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the original list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is 0.**
