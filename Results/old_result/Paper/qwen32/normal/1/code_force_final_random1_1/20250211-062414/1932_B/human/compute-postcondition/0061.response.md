Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state:

- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements.
- `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`.
- `ai` is the third element in `a`.
- If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than `old_next_year`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
next_year = current_year + ai
```

This line of code directly sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`, regardless of the divisibility condition mentioned in the initial state description. Therefore, the value of `next_year` will be updated to `current_year + ai`.

Since the other conditions and variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `test`, `n`, `a`, `current_year`, `ai`) are not altered by this specific line of code, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`; `ai` is the third element in `a`; `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**
