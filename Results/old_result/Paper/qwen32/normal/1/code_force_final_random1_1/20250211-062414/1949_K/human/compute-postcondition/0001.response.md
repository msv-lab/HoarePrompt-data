Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of integers, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

Explanation: The initial state specifies the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. The code initializes three empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. No other variables are affected.
