To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each line of input and what the final state looks like after processing all `t` lines.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The variable `t` indicates the number of test cases (lines) to process. Each line contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each line `s` in the input (excluding the first line which contains `t`):
     - Split the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
     - Update `b` to `b + c`.
     - Compute the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` and print the result.
       - This expression can be simplified as follows:
         - If `c < b % 3`, then the expression evaluates to `-1`.
         - Otherwise, it evaluates to `a - (-b // 3)`, which simplifies to `a + b // 3` (since `//` is floor division).

### Final Output State:
After processing all `t` lines, the loop will have printed a result for each line based on the above logic. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the values from the last processed line, but they are not retained outside the loop. The only persistent effect is the printed output for each line.

### Conclusion:
The output state after all iterations is simply the series of printed results for each of the `t` lines. Since the problem asks for the output state in terms of variable values, and since `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained outside the loop, we focus on the fact that the loop has processed all `t` lines and printed the appropriate results.

Thus, the final output state can be described as having processed all `t` lines and printed the results accordingly.

Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` lines, and for each line, it has printed either `a + b // 3` or `-1` based on the condition `c < b % 3`.**
