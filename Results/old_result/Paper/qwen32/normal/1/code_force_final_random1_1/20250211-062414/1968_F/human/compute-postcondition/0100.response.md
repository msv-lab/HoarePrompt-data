To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`).
2. **Loop Head Adjustment**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
3. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Given Information:
- `data` is a list of strings split from the input line.
- `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`).
- `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 3`.
- `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 1.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i` in its list.

### Adjusted State:
Since only `i` needs to be adjusted, and `n` remains the same, we increment `i` by 1.

If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

### Final State:
Assuming `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 3`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, and `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i` in its list, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 3`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, and `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i` in its list, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
