You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1]. visited and coef are lists of length n initialized to False and None respectively.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except for elements corresponding to initially unvisited nodes which are `1`; `tot` is the value it held after the last DFS call; `bipartite` is the result of the last DFS call; `ok` is `True` if any connected component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot` value; `i` is `n`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x`, `y`, `r` are lists of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except for elements corresponding to initially unvisited nodes which are `1`; `tot` is the value it held after the last DFS call; `bipartite` is the result of the last DFS call; `i` is `n`. If `ok` is `True`, at least one connected component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot` value; if `ok` is `False`, no connected component is bipartite with a non-zero `tot` value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but operates on global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. It processes `n` disks defined by their centers (`x[i]`, `y[i]`) and radii `r[i]`, and modifies the `visited` list to mark disks as processed and the `coef` list to store some coefficients related to the disks. The function does not return any value directly but modifies the global state of `visited` and `coef`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
