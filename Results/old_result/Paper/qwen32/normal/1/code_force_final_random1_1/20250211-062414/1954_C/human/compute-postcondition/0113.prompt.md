Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains unchanged; `x` and `y` remain unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `new` will have `max(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond; `new2` will have `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the point where `a[i] != b[i]`; the number of remaining iterations is zero because the loop has completed all its iterations; `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or `n` if all elements are equal, incremented by 1; `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, indicating that there is at least one index where `a[i] != b[i]`; `new2[i]` is `a[i]` (or equivalently `b[i]`).
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `y` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `new` will have `min(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond; `new2` will have `max(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the point where `a[i] != b[i]`; the number of remaining iterations is zero because the loop has completed all its iterations; `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or `n` if all elements are equal, incremented by 1; `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, indicating that there is at least one index where `a[i] != b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `y` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `new` will have `min(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond; `new2` will have `max(a[i], b[i])` at index `i` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the point where `a[i] != b[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `y` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `new` has `min(a[len(a) - 1], b[len(a) - 1])` at index `len(a) - 1` and `None` for other indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond; `new2` has `max(a[len(a) - 1], b[len(a) - 1])` at index `len(a) - 1`; `i` is now `len(a)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
