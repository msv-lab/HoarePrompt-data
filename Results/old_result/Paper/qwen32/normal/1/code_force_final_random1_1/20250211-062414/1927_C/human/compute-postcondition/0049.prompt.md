Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 2. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is less than `bOnes` plus 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes` and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0. Similarly, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is 1; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 2; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, neither `aOnes` nor `bOnes` is changed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 3; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 4. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
