The code snippet `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list associated with the key `tmp` in the dictionary `lst`. This means that the length of the list `lst[tmp]` will decrease by one, and the variable `tmp` will be updated to the value of the last element that was removed from the list.

Given the initial state, the list `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element, so the operation is valid. After the operation, `tmp` will hold the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]`, and the list `lst[tmp]` will have one less element.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now the last element of the list `lst[z]` before it was popped and has been updated to the last element of the list `lst[tmp]` before it was popped; `one` is True; `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped.**
