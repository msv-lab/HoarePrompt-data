The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input.**
