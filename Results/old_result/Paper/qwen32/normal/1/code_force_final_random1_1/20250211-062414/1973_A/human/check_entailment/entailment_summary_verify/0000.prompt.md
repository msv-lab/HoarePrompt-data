You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to the result of a test case based on specific conditions related to the total points and individual player scores. If the conditions are not met, the result for that test case is `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The total points from all games is calculated as `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - Since each game awards either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), `total_points` must be even. If not, the scores are inconsistent, and the function returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches played is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - The maximum number of matches that could have been played among three players is 3 (each pair playing once). If `total_matchs` exceeds 3, the scores are inconsistent, and the function returns `-1`.
   - Additionally, `p3` cannot exceed `total_matchs` because `p3` represents the highest score, which cannot be greater than the total number of matches.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest and second-highest scores (`p3 - p2`) and between the highest and lowest scores (`p3 - p1`) must account for the wins and losses, leaving the remaining points as draws.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it means the calculated number of draws is invalid, and the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2`.

### Testing the Program:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 0)` -> **Output**: `0` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 1, 1)` -> **Output**: `1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 2, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `1`)
- **Input**: `(3, 3, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)
- **Input**: `(3, 4, 5)` -> **Output**: `6` (Incorrect, should be `3`)
- **Input**: `(1, 1, 10)` -> **Output**: `2` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 6)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)

#### Additional Edge Cases:
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 2)` -> **Output**: `1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(1, 2, 3)` -> **Output**: `2` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(2, 2, 2)` -> **Output**: `3` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 4)` -> **Output**: `2` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 3, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails several test cases and does not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically, it incorrectly calculates the number of draws for certain inputs and does not properly validate all conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of draws for several inputs and does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it fails to correctly compute the number of draws for inputs like `(0, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 3)`, `(3, 4, 5)`, `(1, 1, 10)`, and `(0, 0, 6)`. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
