The code snippet reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is stored in the variable `y`. Since `arr` contains at least one '1', `y` will always have a valid index.

Given that `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, and considering the string is reversed, the index `y` in the reversed string corresponds to the position of the last '1' in the original string. Specifically, `y` can be calculated as `n - x - 1` because reversing the string flips the positions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new integer read from input, `arr` is a string consisting of `n` characters where each character is either '0' or '1', with at least one character equal to '1', and `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, which is equivalent to `n - x - 1`.**
