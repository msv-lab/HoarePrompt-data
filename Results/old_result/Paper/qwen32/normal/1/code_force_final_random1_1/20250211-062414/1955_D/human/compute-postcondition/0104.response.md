Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` remains 0; `cnt_b` has the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
