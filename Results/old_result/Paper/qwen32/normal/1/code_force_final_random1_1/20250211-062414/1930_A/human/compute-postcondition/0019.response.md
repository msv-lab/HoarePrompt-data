The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the value of `l[i]` to the current value of `score`. Given the initial state, `score` is initially set to `l[i_end + 2]`, and `i` is also `i_end + 2`. Therefore, after executing the code, `score` will be updated to `l[i_end + 2] + l[i_end + 2]`, which simplifies to `2 * l[i_end + 2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i_end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is `2 * l[i_end + 2]`, `i` is `i_end + 2`**.
