Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 3; if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**
