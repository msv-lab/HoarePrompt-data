In the given task, the for loop iterates over `b_values`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `b_values`. The loop will execute if `b_values` contains at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `b_values`.
2. For the loop to execute, `b_values` must contain at least one element.

The other variables (`ans`, `curr`, `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) are mentioned but are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `b_values` contains at least one element.

State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element**
