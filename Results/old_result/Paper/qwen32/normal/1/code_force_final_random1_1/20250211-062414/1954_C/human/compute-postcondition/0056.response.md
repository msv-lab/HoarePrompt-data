The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line with `b[0]` equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` equal to `a[1]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new[1]` which is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `new[2]` which is `max(a[2], b[2])`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `a[0]`, `new2[1]` which is `a[1]`, and `new2[2]` which is `min(a[2], b[2])`; `i` is 3; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line with `len(a)` greater than 2 and `a[1]` equal to `b[1]` and `a[2]` equal to `b[2]`.**
