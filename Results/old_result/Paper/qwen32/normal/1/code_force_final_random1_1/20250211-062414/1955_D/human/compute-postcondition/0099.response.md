Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a` with `cnt_b[b[i]]` incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
