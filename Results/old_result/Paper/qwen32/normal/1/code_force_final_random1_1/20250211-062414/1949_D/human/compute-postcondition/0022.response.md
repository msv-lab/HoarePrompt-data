Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then the element at index `j` in `a` is incremented by 2. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then the element at index `j` in `b` is incremented by 2 (since it was already incremented by 1 initially).**
