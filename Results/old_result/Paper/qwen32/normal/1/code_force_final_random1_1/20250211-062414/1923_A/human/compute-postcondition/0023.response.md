Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (each `a_i` is either 0 or 1). For each test case, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in the list `a_i`. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 1 in each list.**
