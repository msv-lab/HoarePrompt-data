Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness based on the function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and those from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework remains visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

### Key Observations:
1. **Visibility Period**: A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m`.
2. **Overlap Calculation**: To maximize the number of fireworks seen at the same time, we need to consider the visibility periods of fireworks launched at different times.
3. **Critical Time Point**: The critical point to check is `min(a, b) + m`, because beyond this point, fireworks from both installations would have started their visibility periods multiple times, and we need to count the overlaps up to this point.

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible up to `min(a, b) + m`. This is given by `(min(a, b) + m) // a`.
- Similarly, calculate the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible up to `min(a, b) + m`. This is given by `(min(a, b) + m) // b`.
- If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, there might be an additional overlap at the exact `min(a, b) + m` point, which needs to be counted once more. However, this condition seems overly restrictive and not necessary for the general case.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the number of fireworks visible up to `min(a, b) + m` for both installations and sums them up. It also includes an additional condition to add 1 if `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. This additional condition is not generally correct because it doesn't account for all possible overlaps correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `m = 5`. The critical point is `min(2, 3) + 5 = 7`. The fireworks visible up to this point are:
- From the first installation: at times 2, 4, 6 (3 fireworks).
- From the second installation: at times 3, 6 (2 fireworks).
- Total fireworks visible at the same time: 3 (at time 6).

However, the provided solution would incorrectly add an extra 1 due to the condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` being false, but it doesn't handle the overlap correctly in other scenarios.

### Function Summary Re-evaluation:
The function summary indicates that the function computes `mn` as `min(a, b) + m` and then prints either `mn // a + mn // b + 1` if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, or `mn // a + mn // b` otherwise. This summary aligns with the provided code logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there are overlaps that are not captured by the additional condition. The original assessment is correct in identifying that the solution is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Final: **False**
