To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i * i <= n + i`.

Given:
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `i` is 3.
- `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`.

The loop condition is `i * i <= n + i`. Let's substitute `i = 3` into this condition:

\[ 3 * 3 \leq n + 3 \]
\[ 9 \leq n + 3 \]
\[ 6 \leq n \]

This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 6. The current state of `n` is not specified directly, but we know it must satisfy the above inequality for the loop to continue.

No other variables (`m` and `ans`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be modified as follows:
State: **`n` must be at least 6, `i` is 3, `m` is the value returned by `func_7()`, and `ans` is `n + 1 + (n + 2) // 4`**
