The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Initially, `L` contains one element `[m]`. After appending `m` again, `L` will contain two elements, both of which are `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
