The `print('NO')` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without any dependency on the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant parts of the initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers with `m` being at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
- `i` is the difference in cumulative counts of 1s between indices `b` and `a-1` in `c`.
- `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is the difference in cumulative sums between indices `b` and `a-1` in `p`.
- There is a condition that either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

However, none of these variables affect the output of the `print('NO')` statement. The statement simply prints `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
