The value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`. All other variables (`d`, `processing`, `da`, `rank`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` remains unchanged, `processing` remains unchanged, `da` remains unchanged, `rank` is updated such that `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`, `tmp` holds the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all valid iterations.**
