To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 2. This variable also does not directly affect the print statement.
- `k` is either 1 (if `res` is not equal to '<') or the value of `i` (if `res` is equal to '<'). The exact value of `k` depends on the value of `res`.
- `res` is the string input by the user. The value of `res` determines the value of `k`.
- `i` is `i + 1`. This means `i` is incremented by 1 before being used in the print statement.

Given these conditions, the print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's analyze the components of the print statement:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `0`: This is a literal integer.
- `k`: This value depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is not equal to '<', `k` is 1. If `res` is equal to '<', `k` is the value of `i`.
- `0`: This is another literal integer.
- `i`: This is the current value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

Since the exact value of `res` and `i` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

If `res` is not equal to '<':
- `k` is 1.
- The output will be: `? 0 1 0 i`.

If `res` is equal to '<':
- `k` is the value of `i`.
- The output will be: `? 0 i 0 i`.

Combining these possibilities, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is 1 if res is not equal to '<', otherwise k is the value of i, and i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
