### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program against the problem statement.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the parameters `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message times (`arr`).

2. **Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - The program creates an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumed between consecutive messages under certain conditions.
   - It iterates through the list of message times starting from the second message (`arr[1]`).
   - For each pair of consecutive messages, it checks if the time difference (`arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`) is less than `b / a`.
     - If true, it calculates the charge consumed during this period (`(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`) and appends it to `array2`.
   - After constructing `array2`, it calculates the total charge consumed:
     - It sums up all values in `array2`.
     - It adds `b` for each message that was not covered by `array2` (i.e., for each message where the time difference was not less than `b / a`).
   - It compares this total charge with the initial charge `f`.

3. **Output:**
   - If the total charge consumed is less than `f`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Logic:

- **Condition for Turning Off and On the Phone:**
  - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect. The phone should be turned off and on if the charge would drop to zero or below if the phone remains on.
  - Instead of checking `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, we should check if the remaining charge after accounting for the time difference is sufficient. Specifically, if `f - (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a <= 0`, the phone should be turned off and on.
  
- **Handling Initial Charge:**
  - The initial charge `f` should be checked against the charge needed to send the first message. If `f - arr[0] * a <= 0`, it is impossible to send the first message.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly determine whether Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
