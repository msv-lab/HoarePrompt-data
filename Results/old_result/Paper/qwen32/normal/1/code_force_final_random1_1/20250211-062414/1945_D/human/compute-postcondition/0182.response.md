The code snippet `custo += b_values[y]` adds the value of `b_values[y]` to `custo`. Given the initial state, `y` is 1, and `b_values[1]` is 25. Therefore, `custo` which was initially 120, will be updated to 145.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`custo` is 145, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `y` is 1, and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. Specifically, `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` (which is 10 + 25) is less than or equal to `a_values[1]` (which is 20).**
