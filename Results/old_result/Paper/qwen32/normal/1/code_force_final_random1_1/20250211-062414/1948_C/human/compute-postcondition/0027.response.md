Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to `<`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to `<`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur regarding the control flow.**
