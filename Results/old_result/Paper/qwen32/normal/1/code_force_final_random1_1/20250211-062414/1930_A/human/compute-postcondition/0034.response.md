To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the list `l`. The loop iterates over the indices of `l` in steps of 2, starting from index 0, and adds the value at each of these indices to `score`.

Given that the loop runs for `2 * n` iterations, it will process the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `2 * n`. This means it will process the first `n` elements of the list `l` at even indices.

Let's summarize the process:
- The loop starts with `score = 0`.
- It adds `l[0]` to `score` in the first iteration.
- It adds `l[2]` to `score` in the second iteration.
- It adds `l[4]` to `score` in the third iteration.
- ...
- It continues this pattern until it has added `l[2 * (n - 1)]` to `score`.

Thus, the final `score` will be the sum of the elements at the even indices of the list `l` up to the `(n-1)`th even index.

The final output state is:
- `t` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001.
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `l` remains the same sorted list of integers derived from the new input.
- `score` is the sum of the elements at the even indices of `l` up to the `(n-1)`th even index.

In mathematical terms, `score` is given by:
\[ \text{score} = l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + \ldots + l[2 * (n - 1)] \]

Output State: **t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, n is the input integer, l is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, score is the sum of the elements at the even indices of l up to the (n-1)th even index.**
