To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what values it computes. The loop calculates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` using the formula:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007 \]

Given the initial conditions:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`

And the values after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `dp[3] = 7`
- After 2 iterations: `dp[4] = 25`
- After 3 iterations: `dp[5] = 81`

We can continue this process up to `dp[n]`. However, since the problem does not specify a particular value for `n`, we will describe the final state in terms of `dp[n]`.

Let's compute the next few values to identify a pattern or simply describe the final state in terms of `dp[n]`:

- For `i = 6`: 
  \[
  dp[6] = (dp[5] + 2 \cdot 5 \cdot dp[4]) \mod 1000000007 = (81 + 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 25) \mod 1000000007 = (81 + 250) \mod 1000000007 = 331
  \]

Continuing this process would yield `dp[7]`, `dp[8]`, ..., `dp[n]`. However, the exact value of `dp[n]` depends on the specific value of `n` provided in the input.

The final output state after all iterations will include the values of `dp[1]` through `dp[n]`, with `i` equal to `n+1` since the loop runs from `3` to `n` inclusive.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, ..., `dp[n]` is the value computed by the loop, `i` is n+1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the state includes all computed `dp` values from `dp[1]` to `dp[n]`, and the loop index `i` will be `n+1`.
