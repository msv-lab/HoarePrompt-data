Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1, `nums[1]` is 1 or more, `nums[start]` is decreased by 1. If `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, `nums[start + 1]` is also decreased by 1 and `start` is 3; otherwise, `start` remains 2. `vis` is a set containing the values 0, 1, and 2. If `nums[start + 1]` was zero, the program returns None.**
