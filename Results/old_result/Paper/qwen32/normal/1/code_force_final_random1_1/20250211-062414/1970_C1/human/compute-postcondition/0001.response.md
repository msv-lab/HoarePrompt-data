The given code snippet initializes a dictionary `lst` using `defaultdict(list)`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges (u, v), `u_1`, `x`, or `y`. The only change is the introduction of `lst` which is now a dictionary with list as its default value type.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
