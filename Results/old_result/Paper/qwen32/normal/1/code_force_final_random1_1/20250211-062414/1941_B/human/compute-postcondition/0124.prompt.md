Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is the integer read from input representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n-2` elements are 0. If at least one of the last two elements of `a` is not 0, then `a` remains unchanged. If both of the last two elements of `a` are 0, then they remain 0. If `stop` is True, then `stop` remains True. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n-2` elements are `0`, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`; `stop` is `True` if at least one element in the first `n-2` elements was negative, otherwise `stop` remains `False`. Additionally, either both the last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` are `0`, or at least one of them is not `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list where the first `n - 2` elements are 0, and either the last two elements are both 0 or at least one of the last two elements is not 0, and `stop` remains unchanged (either True or False).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
