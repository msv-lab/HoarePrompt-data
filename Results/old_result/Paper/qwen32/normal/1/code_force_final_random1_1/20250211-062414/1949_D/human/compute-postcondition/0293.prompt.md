You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and j-th scenarios and can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (i=j). It is guaranteed that the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. At most ⌊n/2⌋ transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters in the input are 'F' or 'S').

        #State: n strings, each of length n, constructed by replacing '?' in xx[i] with 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions involving sb[:n // 4].
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the program processes the input strings as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program constructs `n` strings, each of length `n`, by replacing '?' in `xx[i]` with 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions involving `sb[:n // 4]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a matrix of size `n x n` representing transition videos between scenarios. Each element in the matrix can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (indicating no transition needed when i=j). The function returns a valid configuration of the matrix where at most ⌊n/2⌋ transitions are either 'F' or 'S', ensuring symmetry and consistency across the matrix.
