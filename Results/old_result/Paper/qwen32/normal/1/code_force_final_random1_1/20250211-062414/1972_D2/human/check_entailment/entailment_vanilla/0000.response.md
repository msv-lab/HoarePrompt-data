Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function seems to be designed to handle a single test case.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`:
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It reads `n` and `m` from the input.
- It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` with the condition `x * x <= n`.
- For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

#### Issues in `func_1()`:
- The logic inside the nested loops does not correctly address the problem requirements.
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is too restrictive. The problem requires checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) for all pairs \((a, b)\).
- The way `cnt` is incremented does not match the problem's requirement to count valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This can be done using nested loops for `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
