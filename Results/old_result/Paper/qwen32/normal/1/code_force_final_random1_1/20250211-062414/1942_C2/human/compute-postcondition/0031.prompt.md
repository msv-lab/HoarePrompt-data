Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is equal to 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `tmp` is a list containing the single element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If neither condition is met, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `i + 2`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` includes the new element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is reduced by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. If neither condition is met, no changes occur to `ans`, `tmp`, or `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
