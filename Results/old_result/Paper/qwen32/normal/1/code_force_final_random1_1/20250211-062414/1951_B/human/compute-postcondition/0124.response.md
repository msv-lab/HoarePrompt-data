Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped and must have at least one element; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `z` is either 0 or 1; `i` is the next element in the list `s`; `ans1` is incremented by 1.** 

In simple terms, the only change is that `ans1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
