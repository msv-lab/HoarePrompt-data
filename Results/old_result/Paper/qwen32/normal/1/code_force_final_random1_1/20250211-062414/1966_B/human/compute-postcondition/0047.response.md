The given code snippet only contains the line `gr = []`. This line reassigns the variable `gr` to an empty list, effectively discarding its previous value.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- `gr` is now an empty list `[]`.
- `i` remains `n-2` if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, but since `gr` is now an empty list, this condition cannot be evaluated, and `i` retains its previous value.
- `j` remains `m-2` if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, but since `gr` is now an empty list, this condition cannot be evaluated, and `j` retains its previous value.
- `impossible` remains True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, but since `gr` is now an empty list, this condition cannot be evaluated, and `impossible` retains its previous value.
- `ans` remains 'NO' if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` or `impossible` is True, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES'. Since `gr` is now an empty list, this condition cannot be evaluated, and `ans` retains its previous value.
- `tc` remains incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is an empty list `[]`, `i` retains its previous value, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
