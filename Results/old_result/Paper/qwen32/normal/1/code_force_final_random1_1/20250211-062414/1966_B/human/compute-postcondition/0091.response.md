The code snippet `gr = []` reassigns the variable `gr` to an empty list, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `tc`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
