Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
'''

 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` representing the number of test cases. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times, with each element in the list corresponding to the result of a single call to `func_3()`.

    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line of input from standard input, removes any trailing newline characters, and returns the resulting string.

 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` takes a positive integer `rows` as input and returns a list of length `rows`. Each element in the list is the result of a single call to the function `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns a string representing a pair of positive integers n and m, separated by a space, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 2,000,000 inclusive.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` prompts the user to input an integer representing the number of test cases, `t`, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and returns this integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string at each whitespace.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` calculates and assigns a rank to a given key `da` in the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 if the list associated with `da` contains only one element. Otherwise, it recursively explores the elements in the list, updating the `processing` list to mark elements as visited, and computes the minimum rank among the recursive calls, adding 1 to this minimum rank before returning it. The computed rank is stored in the `rank` list at the index corresponding to `da`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` computes the coefficients of Bézout's identity and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `x` and `y` are the coefficients such that `ax + by = g`, and `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It adjusts `k` by subtracting the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`, up to the first `n` elements of `a`. If the adjusted `k` is non-negative, it returns `1`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function calculates and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + k) // (k * k)` for all `k` from 1 to `i-1`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`. Here, `n` is a positive integer obtained from another function `func_7()`, and `m` is also obtained from `func_7()` but is not used in the calculation.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` performs a series of operations involving the functions `func_10` and `func_15`. It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters `n` and `m` as arguments, despite the annotations suggesting otherwise.
