Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` is True, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**

Explanation: The value of `impossible` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
