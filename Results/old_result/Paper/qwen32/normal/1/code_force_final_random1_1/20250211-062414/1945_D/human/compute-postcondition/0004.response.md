The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` remain unchanged. The new variable `custo_pra_passar_b` is introduced and populated with the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input.**
