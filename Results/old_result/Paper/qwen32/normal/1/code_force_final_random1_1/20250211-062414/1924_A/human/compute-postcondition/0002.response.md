The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `k`, and `m` already have specific ranges, but these values will be overwritten by the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
