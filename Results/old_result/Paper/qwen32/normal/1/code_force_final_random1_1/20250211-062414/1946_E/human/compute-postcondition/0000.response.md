The code snippet calls a function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `1000000007`. The function returns two values which are assigned to variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `c` and `d` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.
