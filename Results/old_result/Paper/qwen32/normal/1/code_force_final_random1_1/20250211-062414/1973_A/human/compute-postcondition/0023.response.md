The code snippet provided updates the value of `total_matchs` by setting it to the integer division of `total_points` by 2. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `total_points` is the sum of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`. Since the code only changes `total_matchs`, we need to reflect this change in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is 3 times the difference between the sum of the first two elements and the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` at the end.**
