The code snippet `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given the initial state, the list `l` starts with `[1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-1]`. After removing the last element (`n-1`), the list `l` will be `[1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `k == 0` is still false, and the program does not return the list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is `k - 2*i + 2` and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list starting with 1, then `n`, and then containing integers from 2 to `n-2`; `x` is `n-1`; `i` is `i`.**
