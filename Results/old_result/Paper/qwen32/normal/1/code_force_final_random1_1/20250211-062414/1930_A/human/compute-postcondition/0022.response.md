To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it affects the variables.

The loop iterates over the list `l` with a step size of 2, starting from index 0 up to `2 * n`. In each iteration, it adds the element at the current index `i` to the `score`.

Given the pattern from the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `score = l[0]`
- After 2 iterations: `score = l[0] + l[2]`
- After 3 iterations: `score = l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`

This pattern suggests that after all iterations, the `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l` starting from index 0 up to `2 * n - 2`.

Therefore, the final `score` will be the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `2 * n - 2`.

Let's formalize this in the output state format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `2 * n - 2` in the list `l`.**

In simpler terms, the final `score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l` starting from the first element. The values of `t` and `l` remain unchanged as per the precondition, and `n` dictates how many elements are considered in the summation.
