Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input. If `m` equals `n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged regardless of whether both `m` and `n` are even or not.**
