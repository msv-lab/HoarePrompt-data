You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)

    #State: a sequence of t integers, each representing the largest divisor d of x for each test case that satisfies the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `(x - n * d)` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case according to the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the GCD, we should try to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x` can be split into `n` parts, each being a multiple of `d`.
   - This means `x` must be divisible by `d`, and `(x / d)` must be at least `n` because we need `n` parts.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be divided into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i`. This is checked by ensuring `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
   - Similarly, it checks the corresponding larger divisor `x // i`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum valid divisor found.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly iterates through potential divisors and checks the conditions necessary to ensure that `x` can be split into `n` parts with the same difficulty.
   - By considering both `i` and `x // i` for each divisor, it ensures that all potential divisors are considered.
   - The use of the square root limit for iteration is efficient and sufficient since divisors come in pairs that multiply to `x`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `x == n`, the only possible division is into `n` parts each of difficulty `1`, so the GCD is `1`.
   - When `x` is a prime number and `n == 1`, the entire problem can be one sub-problem of difficulty `x`, so the GCD is `x`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly compute the maximum balance for each test case.
