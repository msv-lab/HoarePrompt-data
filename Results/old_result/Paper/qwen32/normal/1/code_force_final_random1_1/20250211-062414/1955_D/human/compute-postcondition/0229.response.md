The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `ans` is determined based on the conditions involving `curr` and `k`.
- `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `b_values` remain unchanged.
- `i` is `x + 1`.

After executing the code snippet, only `cnt_b` will be updated. Specifically, the count of the element `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will increase by 1.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 1 otherwise; `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `b_values` remain unchanged; `i` is `x + 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
