The given code snippet increments the variable `idx` by 2. This change affects the value of `idx` while all other variables remain unchanged.

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`); `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.

After executing `idx += 2`, the new value of `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`); `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key`.**
