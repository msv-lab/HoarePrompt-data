The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition) and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not change the state, we only need to adjust `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4. After each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2**
