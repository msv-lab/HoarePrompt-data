Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the calculation of the product of the array elements and their remainders when divided by `m`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Selection of Elements**: The program selects elements from the array based on the commands but does not compute the product of the remaining elements correctly. Instead, it appends the selected element to a list `b` and then computes the product of these selected elements in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

2. **Product Calculation**: The problem requires computing the product of all elements in the array at each step before removing an element according to the command. The program, however, computes the product of the selected elements, which are not necessarily the remaining elements in the array.

To fix the program, you need to maintain the product of the entire array and update it as elements are removed according to the commands. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    result = []
    
    # Process each command
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        
        if command == 'L':
            # Remove the leftmost element
            product = (product * pow(a[left], m-2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse to divide
            left += 1
        else:
            # Remove the rightmost element
            product = (product * pow(a[right], m-2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse to divide
            right -= 1
    
    return result
```

In this corrected version, the product of the array elements is maintained, and the modular inverse is used to efficiently "divide" by an element when it is removed from the array. This ensures that the product of the remaining elements is correctly computed at each step.
