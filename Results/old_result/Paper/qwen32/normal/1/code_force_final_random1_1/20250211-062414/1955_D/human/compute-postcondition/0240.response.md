To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the context:

- `ans` is incremented by 1 for each window `[i + 1, i + m]` where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `b_values`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- `curr` and `cnt_b` reflect the final window state.

From this information, we can infer that `ans` is a counter that keeps track of how many windows meet the condition `curr >= k`.

However, the exact values of `ans`, `curr`, `k`, `b_values`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are not explicitly provided. Therefore, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the conditions it satisfies.

Given that `ans` is incremented based on the number of windows where `curr >= k`, the output will be the final count of such windows.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of windows [i + 1, i + m] where curr is greater than or equal to k)**
