You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):

        print(ans)
        
    #State: a sequence of t integers, each representing the largest divisor d of x for each test case that satisfies the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `(x - n * d)` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that:
- The sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
- The difficulties are positive integers.
- We aim to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these difficulties.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to find the maximum possible GCD by iterating through potential divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to split `x` into `n` parts.

#### Key Points:
1. **Iterate through potential divisors**: The program iterates from `1` to `sqrt(x)` to find divisors of `x`.
2. **Check divisibility and feasibility**: For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be split into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` or `x // i`.
3. **Update the maximum GCD**: If the conditions are met, it updates the maximum GCD found.

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle cases where `x` is very small or `n` is very large.
2. **Feasibility Check**: The check `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensures that the remaining difficulty after allocating `n-1` parts of size `i` can be evenly distributed among the remaining parts. Similarly, `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` ensures the same for the other divisor.
3. **Correctness of the Logic**: The logic seems correct in terms of finding the maximum GCD by considering all possible divisors and ensuring feasibility.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases:

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input**: `10 3`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: Possible split: `[4, 2, 4]` with GCD `2`.

2. **Input**: `5 5`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible split: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with GCD `1`.

3. **Input**: `420 69`
   - **Output**: `6`
   - **Explanation**: Possible split: `[6, 6, ..., 6]` with GCD `6`.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input**: `1 1`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible split: `[1]` with GCD `1`.

2. **Input**: `100 1`
   - **Output**: `100`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible split: `[100]` with GCD `100`.

3. **Input**: `100 100`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible split: `[1, 1, ..., 1]` with GCD `1`.

4. **Input**: `100 50`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: Possible split: `[2, 2, ..., 2]` with GCD `2`.

### Conclusion
After testing the program with various inputs, including edge cases, it appears to correctly compute the maximum balance for each test case. The logic seems sound, and no counterexamples were found where the program fails to produce the correct output.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly finds the maximum possible GCD by iterating through all potential divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to split `x` into `n` parts with the required properties. It handles various edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided examples and additional test cases.
