To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not relevant to the loop condition and does not need adjustment).
- `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `tc` is set to a value greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0**
