The code snippet assigns a tuple `(i, ind)` to the key `line[ind]` in the dictionary `elements`. Given the initial state, `ind` is updated to `ind + 1`, so the key used in the dictionary assignment is `line[ind + 1]`.

Therefore, the value of `elements[line[ind + 1]]` is set to the tuple `(i, ind)`. The values of `line` and `ind` remain unchanged except for the increment of `ind`.

Output State: **`line` must have at least `ind + 2` elements, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`**.

In natural language: The dictionary `elements` now has a new entry where the key is `line[ind + 1]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)`. The index `ind` has been incremented by 1, and `line` still must have at least `ind + 2` elements.
