The code snippet assigns the value of the next input to the variable `b`. This means that `b` will now hold whatever string is provided as input.

Given that the initial state specifies `t` as an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` as an even integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5, and `a` as a string of length `n` consisting only of '<' and '>', these conditions remain unchanged. The new variable `b` will take the value of the subsequent input.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer (which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is the input string.**
