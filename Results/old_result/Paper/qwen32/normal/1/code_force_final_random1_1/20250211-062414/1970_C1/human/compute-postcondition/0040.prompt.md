Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[tmp]` is now empty; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now equal to `z`; `one` is True if the number of iterations is even, or False if the number of iterations is odd; `two` is True`.
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[tmp]` is now empty; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a, and `rev[z]` contains at least one element except the last one which was popped; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `rev[z]` before it was popped; `one` is True if the number of iterations is even, or False if the number of iterations is odd; `two` is False
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[tmp]` is now empty; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a, and `rev[z]` contains at least one element except the last one which was popped; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `rev[z]` before it was popped; `one` is True if the number of iterations is even, or False if the number of iterations is odd; `two` is True; `rev[tmp]` must contain at least one element

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
