The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise OR operation between the current value of `cur` and `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` positions. This effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` to 1.

Given the initial state, `cur` was 0, and the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` was 0, which means the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was already 0 before the operation. After the operation, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` will be set to 1.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet; the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is `1 << cur_ss`.**

In simpler terms, `cur` now has its bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
