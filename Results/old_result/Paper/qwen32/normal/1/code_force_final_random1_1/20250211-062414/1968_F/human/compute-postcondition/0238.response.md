The code snippet updates the value of `it1` using the `bisect.bisect_left` function, which finds the insertion point for `l` in the list `v1` to maintain sorted order. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given the initial state, `it1` is now set to the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` while keeping `v1` sorted. 

Output State: **`data`, `t`, `idx` is increased by 2, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `it2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`. `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`. `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order.**
