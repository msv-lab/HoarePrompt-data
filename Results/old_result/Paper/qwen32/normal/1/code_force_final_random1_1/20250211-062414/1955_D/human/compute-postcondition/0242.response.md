The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the element at index `i` of the dictionary `cnt_b`. This means that whatever the previous value was at `cnt_b[i]`, it is now `0`.

Given the initial state only specifies that `b_values` must contain at least one element, there's no information about the dictionary `cnt_b` or the index `i`. Therefore, we can only state that `cnt_b[i]` is now `0`.

Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element; `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
