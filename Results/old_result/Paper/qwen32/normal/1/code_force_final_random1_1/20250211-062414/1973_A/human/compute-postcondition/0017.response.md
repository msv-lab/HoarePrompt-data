Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple. `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` and is odd. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` where `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` is a list containing the elements [-1, -1] if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is true, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing the element [-1], and an additional element `-1` is appended to `resultats`. If `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, `resultats` is a list containing the elements [-1, -1, egalites // 2] if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is true, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing the element [-1, egalites // 2].**
