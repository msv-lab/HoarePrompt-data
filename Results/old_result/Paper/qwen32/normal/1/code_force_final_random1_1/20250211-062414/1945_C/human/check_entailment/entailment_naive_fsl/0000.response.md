Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The code calculates percentages instead of checking the ceiling of half the number of residents on each side. Specifically, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated using percentages, which is not required. Instead, the code should check if the number of zeros on the left side is at least `ceil(i/2)` and the number of ones on the right side is at least `ceil((n-i)/2)`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the cases where the road could be placed before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position n). It only considers positions between houses 1 and n-1.

3. **Minimum Distance Calculation**: The code calculates the minimum distance from the middle but does not correctly handle the case where placing the road before the first house or after the last house might be optimal.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

#### Counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- If the road is placed before the first house (position 0), there are 0 houses on the left side and 3 houses on the right side. Since there are no houses on the left side, the condition is trivially satisfied. On the right side, there are 2 ones, which is more than half of 3. Therefore, position 0 is a valid solution.
- If the road is placed after the first house (position 1), there is 1 house on the left side with 1 zero, which is not more than half of 1. Therefore, position 1 is not valid.
- If the road is placed after the second house (position 2), there are 2 houses on the left side with 2 zeros, which is more than half of 2. On the right side, there is 1 house with 1 one, which is more than half of 1. However, position 0 is closer to the middle than position 2.

The provided code will not output `0` for this input because it does not correctly handle the case where the road can be placed before the first house. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve iterating through all possible positions (including 0 and n) and checking the conditions for each position. For each position, calculate the number of zeros on the left and the number of ones on the right, and check if they meet the required conditions. Keep track of the position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
