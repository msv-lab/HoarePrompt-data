The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial state already specifies that `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to \(10^9\), the code will overwrite these variables with the new input values.

The variable `t` must be greater than 0, but since it is not mentioned in the code snippet, its value remains unchanged. Similarly, the `results` list is initially empty and is not modified by the provided code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
