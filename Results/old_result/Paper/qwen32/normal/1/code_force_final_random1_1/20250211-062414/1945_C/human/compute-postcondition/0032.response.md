The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. Therefore, the list `lst` will now contain the value 2.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `mini`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `z`, `o`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `i` is 1; `lst` is [2]**.
