Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, neither `2a == b` nor `2b == a`, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` can be either odd or even.**
