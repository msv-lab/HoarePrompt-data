The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, and `ind` is 1. Therefore, the tuple `(i, 1)` is appended to either the first or the second list within `goal`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1), `line[1]`: (i, 1)}; If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` includes `line[ind]` with the value (i, ind). If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[ind]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal` is a list of two lists where one list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` and the other remains empty. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; `ind` is 1; `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, 1)`**.
