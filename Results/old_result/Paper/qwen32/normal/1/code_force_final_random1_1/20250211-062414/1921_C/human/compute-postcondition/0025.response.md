The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `test_cases`. Since the loop iterates over `range(test_cases)`, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is a list that may include the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is compared to `f`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value (let's assume it was `x`). For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list that may include the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `x + 1`**
