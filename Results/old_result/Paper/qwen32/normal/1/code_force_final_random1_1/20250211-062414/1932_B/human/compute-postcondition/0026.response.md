The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` changes to whatever integer the user inputs. The other variables (`year`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`year` is the result of the loop processing all elements in `a` according to the rule `year += year % ai or ai`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is updated to the integer provided by the user, while `year`, `t`, and `a` retain their initial values.
