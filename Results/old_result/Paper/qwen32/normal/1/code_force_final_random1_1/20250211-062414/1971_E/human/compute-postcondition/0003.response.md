The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, maps them to a list, and then prepends a 0 to this list, assigning the result to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.**
