The code appends `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`i` and `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `k-1`
- `tmp` is `'a'`
- `ans` is `ans + 'a'`

After executing the line `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `tmp` is `'a'`, `ans` is `ans + 'a' + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`**.
