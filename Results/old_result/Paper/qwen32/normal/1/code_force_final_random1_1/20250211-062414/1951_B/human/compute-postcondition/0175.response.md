The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it changes during each iteration.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element.
- `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap).
- `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes.
- `p` is the value of `j`.
- `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.
- If `i` equals `h`, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1.
- If `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0.
- `z` remains unchanged if `i` does not equal `h`.
- `i` may or may not equal `h`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on the value of `s[j]` (or `s[p]`), and `j` (or `p`) has been incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to take on the value of the next element in the list `s`.

Since `j` (or `p`) is the index of the last element compared to `h`, the next value of `i` should be `s[j+1]` (or `s[p+1]`). Therefore, we need to increment `j` (or `p`) by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element; `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap); `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes, incremented by 1; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; if `i` equals `h`, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1; if `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0; `z` remains unchanged if `i` does not equal `h`; `i` is `s[j+1]` (or `s[p+1]`).**

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head (`i`), the final state should reflect the new value of `i` and the incremented `j` (or `p`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element; `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap); `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes, incremented by 1; `p` is the value of `j`; `i` is `s[j]`.**
