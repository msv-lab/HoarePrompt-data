Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1), `line[ind]`: (i, ind)}; `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; the current element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..' and is not a player. If the second character of the string at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where one list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` and the other remains empty; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list of two empty lists.**
