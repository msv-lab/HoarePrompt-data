The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes on values 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 7 (as long as `7 < n`). The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is a string; `i` is 7**
