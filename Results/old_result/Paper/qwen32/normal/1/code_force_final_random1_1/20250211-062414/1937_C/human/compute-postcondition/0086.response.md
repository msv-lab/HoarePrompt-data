Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the previous value of `n` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `i` is the previous value of `n`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', and `res` is the user input. If `res` equals '<', then `k` is updated to the previous value of `n`.**
