The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[2]` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer value greater than 0.
- `idx` is 5.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2]` (which must be at least 1).
- `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[4])`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`.
- If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include `int(data[4]): []`. Otherwise, `mp` remains unchanged.

Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet, we assume `i` is 5 based on the context provided (`pf[5]` is mentioned).

Thus, `mp[pf[5]].append(5)` translates to `mp[int(data[4])].append(5)`. This means that the list associated with the key `int(data[4])` in the dictionary `mp` will have `5` appended to it.

Therefore, the updated state of `mp` will be `{int(data[4]): [5]}` if `int(data[4])` was not already a key in `mp`. If `int(data[4])` was already a key in `mp`, the list associated with that key will now include `5`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[2]` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]` (which must be at least 1); `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `mp` is a dictionary where the key `int(data[4])` has the value `[5]` appended to its list.**
