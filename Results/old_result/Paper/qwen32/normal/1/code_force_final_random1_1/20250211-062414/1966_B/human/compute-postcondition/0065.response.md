The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so if `j` was previously `m - 2`, it would now be `m - 1`, and the loop would terminate. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m - 1`.

Given that `i` is equal to `n-1` and `j` has just been incremented, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to the value it had at the start of the previous iteration, which is `m - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the character at position `j` of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the first string, or the character at position `j` of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the last string, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` retains its value of True.**
