To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs (`n` and `m`) and accumulates results. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Loop Iteration**: For each iteration (determined by `t`), the loop reads two integers `n` and `m`.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
3. **Inner Loop**: The inner `while` loop runs as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Inside the loop:
   - It calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It calculates `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` from it.
   - It adds `int(g / count) + 1` to `ans`.
   - It increments `count` by 1.
4. **Output**: After the inner loop completes, it prints the value of `ans`.

The final output state after all iterations will be the accumulated results of `ans` for each set of inputs (`n` and `m`). Since the problem doesn't specify the exact values of `n` and `m` for each iteration, we can generalize the final state based on the loop's behavior.

### Final Output State Description
- **`t`**: The total number of iterations the loop has executed.
- **`i`**: The loop variable that iterates from 0 to `t-1`.
- **`n` and `m`**: These are the last read input values for the final iteration.
- **`count`**: This will be `m + 1` if the inner loop completed all iterations without breaking, otherwise, it will be the value of `count` when the loop broke.
- **`ans`**: This will be the final accumulated result for the last iteration, which is `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each valid inner loop iteration.

Since the question asks for the final output state after all iterations, we focus on the last iteration's state and the accumulated results.

### Final Output State
Given the above understanding, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **The final `ans` value printed for the last iteration of the outer loop, with `i` equal to `t-1`, and `count` being `m + 1` if the inner loop completed all iterations without breaking, otherwise, it will be the value of `count` when the loop broke.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the accumulated result of the last iteration of the outer loop, printed as `ans`, with all other variables reflecting the state at the end of the last iteration.
