Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with the key `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` having a value of 1, `num` is not in `count` except as the key just added.**

In natural language: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
