Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. b is an empty list.**

Natural Language: The variable `b` has been initialized as an empty list. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`) retain their initial values and conditions.
