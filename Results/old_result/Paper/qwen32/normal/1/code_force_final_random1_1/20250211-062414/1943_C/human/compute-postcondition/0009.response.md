The code reads two integers from the input, splits them into a tuple, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` additionally contains `u`; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input.**
