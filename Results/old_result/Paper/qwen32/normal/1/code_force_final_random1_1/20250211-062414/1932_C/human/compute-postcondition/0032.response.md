The only variable in the loop head is `v`, which iterates over the reversed list `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `v` changes.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the second-to-last element of the reversed list `b`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `v` should be the last element of the reversed list `b`.

Let's break it down:

- The loop iterates over `b` in reverse order.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was `b[n-2]` (second-to-last element of `b`).
- At the start of the next iteration, `v` should be `b[n-1]` (last element of `b`).

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop header (`for v in reversed(b)`).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` is `[p, p]`; `p` is `(p * v) % m`; `v` is `b[n-1]`**
