The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable that needs adjustment is `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1 (since each iteration decreases `t` by 1).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
