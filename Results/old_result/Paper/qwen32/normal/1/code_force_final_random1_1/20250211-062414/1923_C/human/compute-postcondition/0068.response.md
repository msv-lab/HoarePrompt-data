The code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` was `[0, j]`, and after appending `j`, `c` becomes `[0, j, j]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `c` is `[0, j, j]`, `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `x`. If `x` equals 1, then `j` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `j` remains 1 if the next element in the list `l` equals 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.`**
