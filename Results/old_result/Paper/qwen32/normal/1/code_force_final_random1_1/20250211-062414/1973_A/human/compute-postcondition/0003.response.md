Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` (i.e., `total_points = cas_de_test[0][0] + cas_de_test[0][1] + cas_de_test[0][2]`), and `total_points` is odd.**
