Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1), `line[1]`: (i, 1)}; If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` includes `line[ind]` with the value (i, ind). If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[ind]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal` is a list of two lists where one list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` and the other remains empty. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. Additionally, if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; `ind` is 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)`**
