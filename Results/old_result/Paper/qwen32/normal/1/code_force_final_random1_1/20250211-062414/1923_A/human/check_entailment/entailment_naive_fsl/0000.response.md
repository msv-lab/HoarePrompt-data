Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a ribbon divided into `n` cells, each either containing a chip (`1`) or being free (`0`).
- We need to move chips to the left to form a contiguous block of chips with no free cells between them.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Range for `z`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first `1` from the left.
   - `y` is the index of the first `1` from the right (which corresponds to the last `1` in the original array).
   - `n - y` is used as the end index for slicing, but this is incorrect. It should be `n - y - 1` because string indices are 0-based.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where all chips are already in a contiguous block.
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple blocks of chips separated by free cells.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6
1 0 1 0 1 0
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
- The chips are at positions 1, 3, and 5.
- To form a contiguous block, we need to move the chip at position 5 to position 4 and the chip at position 3 to position 2.
- Total operations = 2.

However, the provided program will output `1` for this input because:
- `x` will be `0` (first `1` at position 1).
- `y` will be `1` (last `1` at position 5, which is the second `1` from the right).
- `z` will be `arr[0:5]` which is `"10101"`.
- `z.count('0')` will be `2`, but due to incorrect slicing, the program might output `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations in all cases, especially when there are multiple blocks of chips or when the chips are not initially contiguous.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the range for slicing and does not handle all edge cases, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
