Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and its value is now non-negative; `n` is greater than `m`; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. Since the condition `cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0` is always true (as `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and cannot go below 0), `curr` is increased by 1 if it was greater than 0 before the decrement, and `ans` is updated accordingly.**
