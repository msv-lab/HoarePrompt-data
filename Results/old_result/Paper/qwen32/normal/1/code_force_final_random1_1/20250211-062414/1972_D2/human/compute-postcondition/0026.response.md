The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Initially, `y` is 1, so after the operation, `y` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 since `gcd(2, y) == 1`.**
