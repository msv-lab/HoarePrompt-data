The code snippet increments the value of `l` by 1. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, `i`, `r`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged.**
