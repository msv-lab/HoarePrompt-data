Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Square Definition**: 
   - A square consists of `k` rows, each containing `k` consecutive `1`s.
   - All `1`s are aligned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Triangle Definition**:
   - A triangle consists of `k` rows, where the `i-th` row contains `2*i-1` consecutive `1`s.
   - The `1`s are centered in a single column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also valid.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Counting `1`s**:
   - For each row that contains at least one `1`, the program counts the number of `1`s in that row and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining Shape**:
   - If the counts of `1`s in the first two rows (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) are equal, the program outputs "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "TRIANGLE".

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Square**:
   - The program only checks if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are equal. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square.
   - A square requires that all rows (not just the first two) have the same number of `1`s, and these `1`s must be aligned at an equal distance from the left edge.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Triangle**:
   - The program does not correctly identify triangles.
   - A triangle requires that the number of `1`s in each row follows the pattern `2*i-1` for some `i`, and the `1`s must be centered in a single column.
   - The program does not check for this pattern or the centering condition.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the provided problem description.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
