The code snippet provided is `ans += 2 * y`. This means that the variable `ans` is updated by adding twice the value of `y` to its current value. The values of `even` and `gap` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `even` contains at least one even number greater than 0 and is sorted.
- `gap` is the next value in the list `even` after the current `gap`.

The only variable that changes is `ans`, which is incremented by `2 * y`.

Output State: **`even` contains at least one even number greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next value in the list `even` after the current `gap`; `ans` is increased by `2 * y`.**
