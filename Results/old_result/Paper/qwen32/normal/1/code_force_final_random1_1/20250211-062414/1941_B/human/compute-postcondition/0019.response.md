Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is the input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the if block's postcondition holds. Otherwise, the else block's postcondition holds, which means the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
