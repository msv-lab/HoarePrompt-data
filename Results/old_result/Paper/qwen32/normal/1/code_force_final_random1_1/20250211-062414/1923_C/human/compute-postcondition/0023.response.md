The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is `3 * x`, the list `p` will now contain four elements: `[0, x, 2 * x, 3 * x]`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are still integers read from the input.
- `l` is still a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `c` is still a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`.
- `x` is still the next element in the list `l`.
- `j` is still 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x, 2 * x, 3 * x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `3 * x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
