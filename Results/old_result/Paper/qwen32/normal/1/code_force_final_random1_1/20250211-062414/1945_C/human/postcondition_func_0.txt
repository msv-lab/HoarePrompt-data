The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a binary string `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the smallest index `i` such that the percentage of '0's up to index `i` and the percentage of '1's from index `i+1` to the end are both at least 50%. If no such index exists, it prints `0` if the total percentage of '1's in the string is at least 50%, otherwise it prints `n`.
