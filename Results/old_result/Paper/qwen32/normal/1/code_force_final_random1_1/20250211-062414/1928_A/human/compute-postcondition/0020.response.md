In the given initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not involve any calculations or dependencies on the given variables.

Output: **no**
