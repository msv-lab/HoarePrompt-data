Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state of the variables.

The relevant part of the initial state for this calculation is:
- `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1.
- `i` is 4.
- `zero_perc` is the percentage of zeros up to index `i` in `s`.

The code snippet provided calculates `zero_perc` using the formula:
```python
zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
```

Let's calculate the new value of `zero_perc`:

Since `i` is 4, `i + 1` equals 5. 

If the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', `zero` is 2. Otherwise, `zero` is 1.

Therefore, `zero_perc` can be calculated as:
- If `zero` is 2: `zero_perc = 2 * 100 // 5 = 40`
- If `zero` is 1: `zero_perc = 1 * 100 // 5 = 20`

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet, which they are not.

Thus, the output state depends on whether `zero` is 1 or 2.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1; `one` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains empty; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is 4.**
