The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `custos` is a list with at least one element, specifically `custos = [120, 140]`.
- `c` is assigned the value `140`.

The Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print(c)
```

Given that `c` is explicitly assigned the value `140`, the `print(c)` statement will output this value directly.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **140**
