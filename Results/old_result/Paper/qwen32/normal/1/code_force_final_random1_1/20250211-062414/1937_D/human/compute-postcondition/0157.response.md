Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` was initially 0, `r` remains 0. Otherwise, `r` is either decreased by 1 or set to 1, `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**
