The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given the initial state, `i` is the next even number + 2, and `l` is a sorted list of integers.

Since `i` is defined as the next even number + 2, and assuming `i` was previously calculated to be a specific even number, let's denote the specific value of `i` as `i_value`. The value of `l[i_value]` will be added to `score`.

Let's assume `score` was initially `score_initial`. After executing the line of code, `score` will be `score_initial + l[i_value]`.

Therefore, the updated output state will reflect the new value of `score` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is the next even number + 2, `score` is `score_initial + l[i]`**.
