You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the total number of test cases. Each test case has been fully processed, meaning for each test case, `n` and `m` were read, `l` was a list of integers, `p` and `c` were lists constructed based on cumulative sums and counts of `1`s in `l`, and `m` queries were processed. The final values of `i` and `j` reflect the sum of all elements in `l` and the count of `1`s in `l` from the last processed test case. The variables `a` and `b` hold the values from the last query processed in the last test case, and `s` holds the sum of elements in `l` from index `a` to `b` for that last query. All queries for all test cases have been evaluated, and 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition is met regarding the sum and count of ones in a sub-list defined by the query range, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
An array `a` of length `m` is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of length `m` such that:
1. The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Every element in `b` is greater than 0.

Given an array `c` of length `n`, we need to determine whether each subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good".

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes the array `c` and answers `q` queries about subarrays being "good".

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates prefix sums (`p`) and counts of `1`s (`c`) in the array `c`.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the sum and count of `1`s in the specified subarray.
3. **Condition Check**: It checks if the subarray can be "good" based on the conditions:
   - The subarray length must be greater than 1.
   - The sum of the subarray minus the subarray length must be greater than or equal to the count of `1`s in the subarray.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Condition 2 and 3 Handling**: The program does not explicitly ensure that no element in `a` equals the corresponding element in `b`. It only checks the sum condition and the presence of `1`s.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Subarrays with length 1 cannot be "good" because Condition 2 cannot be satisfied.
   - Subarrays with all elements equal to 1 might not be handled correctly because the program only checks the sum condition.

### Testing Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
- Expected Output: `YES NO YES NO`
- Explanation:
  - `1 5`: Sum = 13, Count of `1`s = 2, Length = 5. `13 - 5 >= 2` is true, but Condition 2 is not checked.
  - `4 4`: Single element, cannot be "good".
  - `3 4`: Sum = 5, Count of `1`s = 1, Length = 2. `5 - 2 >= 1` is true, but Condition 2 is not checked.
  - `1 3`: Sum = 4, Count of `1`s = 2, Length = 3. `4 - 3 >= 2` is false.

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Explanation:
  - `1 3`: Sum = 3, Count of `1`s = 3, Length = 3. `3 - 3 >= 3` is false.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle Condition 2 and 3 of the problem description. Specifically, it does not ensure that no element in `a` equals the corresponding element in `b`.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not ensure that no element in `a` equals the corresponding element in `b` and does not handle all edge cases correctly.
