### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the logic and annotations provided to ensure the program's correctness.

1. **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
   - This condition checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price.
   - If true, the program prints `A * B`, meaning it buys all yogurts individually.
   - This makes sense because if the individual price for two yogurts is cheaper than the promotion, it's better to avoid the promotion.

2. **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
   - This condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - If true, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, meaning it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   - This is correct because if `A` is even, we can pair all yogurts and buy them at the promotional price without any leftovers.

3. **Else Condition:**
   - This handles the case when `A` is odd.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and buys the remaining yogurt individually.
   - It prints `X * C + B`, meaning it buys `X` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.
   - This is also correct because if `A` is odd, we can buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt at the individual price.

### Annotations Validation:
- The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly by reading the inputs and applying the logic described above.
- The annotations do not indicate any issues with the logic or calculations.

### Testing the Program:
Let's recheck the provided example inputs and some additional edge cases:

#### Example Inputs:
1. **Input:** `2 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `9` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `9` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `3 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `14` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `14` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `3 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `15` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `15` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `4 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `20` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `20` (Correct).

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `1 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `5` (Buy 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `2 5 10`
   - Expected Output: `10` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `10` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `5 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `23` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `23` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `6 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `27` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `27` (Correct).

5. **Input:** `7 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `32` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `32` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all scenarios according to the problem description and passes all the provided test cases and additional edge cases.

**Final: True**
