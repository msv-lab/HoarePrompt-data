The code snippet assigns the values from the `_`-th tuple in the `test_cases` list to the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. This means that `n` will take the first element of the tuple, `m` will take the second element, and `a` will take the third element (the string).

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, and `results` remains an empty list since no operations affect these variables. The variable `_` is assumed to be a valid index within the range of `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), an integer m (1 <= m <= 5), and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the _-th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _-th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element (string) of the _-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
