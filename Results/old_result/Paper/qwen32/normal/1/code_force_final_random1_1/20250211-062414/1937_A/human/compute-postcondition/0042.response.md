The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. This means the value of `n` changes based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `power` is either equal to `n` or decremented by 1 depending on its initial value, `i` is incremented by 1**.
