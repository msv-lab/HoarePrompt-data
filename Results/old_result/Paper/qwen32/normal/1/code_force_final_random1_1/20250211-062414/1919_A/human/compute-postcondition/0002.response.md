The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Given that `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, and `results` is an empty list, these variables do not directly affect whether the loop can execute or not. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
