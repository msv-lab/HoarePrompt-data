Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not affect the current `print` statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer read from the input. This variable indicates how many integers will be in the list `l`.
3. **`l`**: A map object containing integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. This is essentially a collection of integers.
4. **`lis`**: A sorted list of unique integers from `l`. This means `lis` contains distinct integers from `l` in ascending order.
5. **`test`**: A boolean variable that is `True` if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1. This checks if the sequence in `lis` is continuous without gaps larger than 1.
6. **`j`**: The length of `lis`. This is simply the number of unique integers in `l`.
7. **`i`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 from its previous value. This variable is not directly involved in the `print` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
