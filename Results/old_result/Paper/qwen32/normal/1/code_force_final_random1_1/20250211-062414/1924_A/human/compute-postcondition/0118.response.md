The code snippet initializes a new variable `ans` and assigns it an empty string. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, or `cur`. 

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string.**
