Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\), `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), and `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]` for some index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-2\). Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), and `d2[n - 1]` remains 1.**
