To determine the new state after executing the given code, let's first identify the relevant values and conditions:

- Initial State: 
  - `A = [0, 1, 3]`
  - `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
  - `B = [0, 1, 3]`
  - `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
  - `l = 0`
  - `r = 3`
  - `n` is greater than 0
  - `s[i]` is `'>'`
  - `a = 3 - 3 * i`
  - `b = 3`
  - `l - r > 0` (This condition is false since `l - r` is `-3`, which is not greater than 0)

The code snippet provided is:
```python
b = b - A[l - r - 1]
```

Let's evaluate the expression `l - r - 1`:
- `l - r - 1` = `0 - 3 - 1` = `-4`

Since `-4` is an index out of bounds for the list `A` (which has indices from 0 to 2), accessing `A[-4]` would normally raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem statement does not specify how to handle such cases, we will assume that the code execution stops due to this error, and no further changes occur to the variables.

However, if we hypothetically consider the code to execute without raising an error and assuming some default behavior (which is not standard Python behavior), we would need more context. Given the constraints and typical Python behavior, the code will stop due to the `IndexError`.

Given the problem's format and the fact that the code would normally raise an error, we'll assume the state remains unchanged except for the hypothetical execution of the line, which would not affect the variables as described.

Thus, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [0, 1, 3], idx_B = [2, 1, 0], l = 0, r = 3, n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a = 3 - 3 * i`, `b = 3`**
