To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the optimal strategy for both players. Given that both players play optimally, the outcome of the game depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.

Here's the reasoning:

- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, then Bob will always win.
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, then Alice will always win.

This is because:
- When the total number of coins is even, Alice and Bob will alternate turns, and Bob will always be the one to make the last move when the total number of coins reaches zero.
- When the total number of coins is odd, Alice will make the last move, ensuring she wins.

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and returning 'Bob' if true, otherwise 'Alice'.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
