In this task, the loop head contains the underscore `_` and the result of the function `func_10()`. Since the underscore `_` is just a placeholder and does not represent a variable that needs to be adjusted, the only state that needs adjustment is the return value of `func_10()`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute as long as the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than 0.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must have returned a positive integer.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer again.

Since we don't know the exact implementation of `func_10()`, we can only assume that it will return a positive integer if it did so in the previous iteration. Therefore, we can state that `func_10()` will return a positive integer again, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and the value returned by `func_15()` has been written to standard output followed by a newline character.**
