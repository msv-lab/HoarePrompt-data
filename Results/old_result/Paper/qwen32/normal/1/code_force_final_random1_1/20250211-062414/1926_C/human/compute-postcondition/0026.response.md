The code snippet modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given that `i` is `n + 2` and `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`, we need to determine the new value of `pd[i]`.

Since `i` is `n + 2`, the digit `j` is the first digit of the number `n + 2`. For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` is 7, and `j` would be 7. If `n` is 99, then `i` is 101, and `j` would be 1.

The initial state specifies that `pd[i]` is already `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + int(j)`. After executing the line `pd[i] += int(j)`, the new value of `pd[i]` will be `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + int(j) + int(j)`, which simplifies to `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `pd[i]` is `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`**.
