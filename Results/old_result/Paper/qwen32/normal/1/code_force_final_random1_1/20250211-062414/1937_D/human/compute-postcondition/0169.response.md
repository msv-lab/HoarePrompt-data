To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0 (the exact value of `n` is not specified but it is known to be positive).
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'` (the exact value of `s[i]` is not relevant for this print statement).
- `i` is 1

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- The variable `n` is described as being greater than 0, but its exact value is not provided. However, since we need to determine the output precisely, we will express the result in terms of `n`.

### Calculation:
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `n - i`.
- Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `n - 1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n - 1` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Thus, the output is:
Output: **n - 1**
