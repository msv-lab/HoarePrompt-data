Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` and `b[5]` incremented by 1 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the previous input string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, `i` is 5, `j` is 1, and the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is either 'S' or not 'F'.**
