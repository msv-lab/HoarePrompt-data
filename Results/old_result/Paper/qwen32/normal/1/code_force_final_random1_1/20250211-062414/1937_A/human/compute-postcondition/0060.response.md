To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable is not used within the loop).
   - `n_cases` is the number of test cases, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration, the code reads an integer `n`.
   - If `n` is 1, it prints 1.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the base-2 logarithm of `n` and finds the smallest integer `power` such that `2 ** power` is greater than or equal to `n`. It then prints `2 ** power`.

### Iteration Details:
- Each iteration processes one test case.
- The loop runs exactly `n_cases` times.
- After processing all test cases, the loop terminates.

### Final Output State:
- `i` will be equal to `n_cases` after the loop completes because `i` increments by 1 for each iteration.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n_cases` remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop but not modified within the loop.

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop index `i` will be equal to the number of test cases (`n_cases`). The variable `t` will still hold its initial value since it is not altered within the loop. The variable `n_cases` will also retain its initial value as it is only used to determine the number of iterations and not modified inside the loop.

### Final Answer:
Output State: **`i` is equal to `n_cases`, `t` remains unchanged, and `n_cases` remains unchanged.**
