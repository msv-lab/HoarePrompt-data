Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `n` remains unchanged. The list `a` retains its initial state of having `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. A new list `b` is created with the same length (`n + 1`) and all its elements are also initialized to 0.
