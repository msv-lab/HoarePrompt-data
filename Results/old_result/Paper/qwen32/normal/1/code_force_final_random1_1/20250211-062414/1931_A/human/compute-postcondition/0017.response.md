The code snippet appends a substring to the `word` variable. Specifically, it takes the character from the `alphabet` string at the index `n - 53` and concatenates it with `'zz'`. Given that `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', the index `n - 53` should correspond to a valid position in this string.

Since `n` is provided by user input and is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the new value of `word` in terms of `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description.

Therefore, the updated `word` will be the character at position `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by `'zz'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
