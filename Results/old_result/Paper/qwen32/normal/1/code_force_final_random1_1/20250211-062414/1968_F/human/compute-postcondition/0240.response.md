The given code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are modified in the provided code.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`data`, `t`, `idx` is increased by 2, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `_` is incremented by 1, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`. `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`. `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order. `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. `'YES'` is appended to `results`.**

In simpler terms: The string `'YES'` is added to the `results` list. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
