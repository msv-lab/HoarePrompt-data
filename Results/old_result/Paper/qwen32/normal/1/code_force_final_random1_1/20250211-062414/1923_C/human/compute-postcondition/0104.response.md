The code snippet provided resets the list `c` to `[0]`. This means that the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list are no longer stored in `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `p` is [0], `c` is [0], `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
