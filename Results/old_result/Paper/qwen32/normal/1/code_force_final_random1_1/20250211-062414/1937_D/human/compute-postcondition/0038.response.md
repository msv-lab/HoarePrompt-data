Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i = n - 1 - j`, `s[i] == '<'`. If `len(idx_B)` was initially 0, then `B = [0]` and `idx_B = []`. Otherwise, `B` is a non-empty list with one more element appended, and `idx_B` is a non-empty list. Additionally, if `len(idx_B)` was not 0, then `x = B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - i) * len(idx_B)`**
