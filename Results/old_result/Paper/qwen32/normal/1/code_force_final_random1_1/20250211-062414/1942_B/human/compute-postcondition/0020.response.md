In this case, the loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop does not directly modify or depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, or `mex`. The loop simply runs a number of times equal to the integer value read from the input.

Given that the loop head does not involve any of the variables mentioned (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`), none of these variables need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The only thing that changes is the implicit counter that Python uses to keep track of how many times the loop has run, which is not exposed in the loop head.

Thus, the state remains the same except for the fact that the loop will execute one more time due to the implicit counter.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.**
