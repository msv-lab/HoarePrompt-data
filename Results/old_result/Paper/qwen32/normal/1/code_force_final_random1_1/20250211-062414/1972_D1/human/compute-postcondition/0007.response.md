It appears there might be a mistake in the provided function definition, as the function `func_16()` does not accept any parameters according to the given code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, I'll assume the function should accept two parameters `n` and `m`.

Here's the corrected version of the description:

The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.

Given the output cases are not specified, I'll assume the task is to simply describe the acceptance of these parameters without additional logic, as no specific output behavior is detailed.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6 inclusive.**
