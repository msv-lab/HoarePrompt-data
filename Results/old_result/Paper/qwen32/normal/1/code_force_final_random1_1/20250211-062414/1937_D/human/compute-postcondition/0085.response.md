Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is `'>'`. If `l < r`, then `r = 3`, `a = 0`, `x = 1`, and `b = 0`. If `r` is 0, then `r` remains 0. Otherwise, `r` remains 3, `a` is set to `3 - 3 * i`, and `b` is set to `3`.**
