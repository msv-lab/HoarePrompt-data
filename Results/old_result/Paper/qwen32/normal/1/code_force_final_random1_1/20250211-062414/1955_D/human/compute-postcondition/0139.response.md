Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[i]]` was not greater than 0, no changes are made to `curr`, `ans`, or `cnt_b[a[i]]`. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is incremented by 1.**
