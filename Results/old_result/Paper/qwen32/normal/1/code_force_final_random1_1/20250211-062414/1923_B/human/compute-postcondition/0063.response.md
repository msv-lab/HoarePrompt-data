Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired, with `a[sorted_indices[0]]` reduced by `delta` to 0; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `pos` is 0; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is `k - delta`; `delta` is `min(k, a[sorted_indices[0]])`. The current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0.**
