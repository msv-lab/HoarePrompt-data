The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2 ** 2`, which is 4. Therefore, `ans` changes from `[1, 2]` to `[1, 2, 4]`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `3 ≤ k ≤ n`; `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of `bk` and `lk` must be at least 2; `ans` is `[1, 2, 4]`; `i` is 2**
