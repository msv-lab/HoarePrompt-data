The code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of `n` zeros, effectively discarding its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the new input, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is `n-1`.**
