To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the process step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (though `t` is not directly relevant to the current `print` statement).
- `n` is the input integer representing the length of the list `ar`.
- `ar` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated as described.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.

### Calculation of `mex` and `res`:
1. **Initialization**: Start with `mex = 0`.
2. **Iterate Backwards**: For each element in `ar` starting from the last element to the first:
   - Calculate `mex - ar[i]` and append it to `res`.
   - Update `mex` to the next smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `ar = [1, 0, 2]`.
- Initialize `mex = 0`.
- Iterate backwards through `ar`:
  - For `ar[2] = 2`: `mex - ar[2] = 0 - 2 = -2`. Append `-2` to `res`. Now `res = [-2]`. Update `mex` to the next unused integer, which is `1`.
  - For `ar[1] = 0`: `mex - ar[1] = 1 - 0 = 1`. Append `1` to `res`. Now `res = [-2, 1]`. Update `mex` to the next unused integer, which is `2`.
  - For `ar[0] = 1`: `mex - ar[0] = 2 - 1 = 1`. Append `1` to `res`. Now `res = [-2, 1, 1]`. Update `mex` to the next unused integer, which is `3`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will join the elements of `res` into a single string separated by spaces and print it.

### General Description:
Given the initial state, the `print` statement will output the elements of the `res` list, which are computed as `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with `mex` being updated accordingly.

### Final Output Format:
Output: **-2 1 1 (where res is computed as mex - ar[i] for each i from len(ar) - 1 to 0 with mex being updated accordingly)**

However, since the exact values of `ar` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `res`. But we can describe the process accurately.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is computed as mex - ar[i] for each i from len(ar) - 1 to 0 with mex being updated accordingly)**
