The code snippet `tot += a` increments the variable `tot` by the value of `a`. Given the initial state, `tot` was already updated to `tot + a` before the code snippet was executed, meaning the effect of `tot += a` is doubling the addition of `a` to `tot`.

Thus, the new value of `tot` will be the original `tot` plus `a` again.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, and `tot` is updated to its previous value plus `a` again.**
