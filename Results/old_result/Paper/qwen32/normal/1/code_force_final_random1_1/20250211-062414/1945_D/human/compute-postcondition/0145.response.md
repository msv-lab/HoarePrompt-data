Output State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is 0, `max_p` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the creation of a new list `b_values` which is initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
