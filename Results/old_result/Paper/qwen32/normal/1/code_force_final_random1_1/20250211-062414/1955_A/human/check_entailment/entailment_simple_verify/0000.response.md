### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure that the logic aligns with the problem description and the expected outcomes.

1. **Program Logic:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
     - This condition checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price.
     - If true, the program prints `A * B`, meaning it buys all yogurts individually.
   
   - **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
     - If true, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, meaning it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   
   - **Else Condition:**
     - This handles the case when `A` is odd.
     - It calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and buys the remaining yogurt individually.
     - It prints `X * C + B`, meaning it buys `X` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.

2. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - They indicate that `i` iterates through each test case, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are correctly assigned from the input.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`, so it skips the first condition.
     - `A % 2 == 0` is true, so it prints `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
     - **Output:** `9` (Correct).
   
   - **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`, so it skips the first condition.
     - `A % 2 == 0` is false, so it goes to the else block.
     - `X = 3 // 2 = 1`, so it prints `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - **Output:** `14` (Correct).
   
   - **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`, so it prints `3 * 5 = 15`.
     - **Output:** `15` (Correct).
   
   - **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is less than `C = 11`, so it prints `4 * 5 = 20`.
     - **Output:** `20` (Correct).

4. **Additional Edge Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `1 5 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`, so it skips the first condition.
     - `A % 2 == 0` is false, so it goes to the else block.
     - `X = 1 // 2 = 0`, so it prints `0 * 9 + 5 = 5`.
     - **Output:** `5` (Correct).
   
   - **Test Case 2:** `2 5 10`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 10`, so it skips the first condition.
     - `A % 2 == 0` is true, so it prints `int(2 * 10 / 2) = 10`.
     - **Output:** `10` (Correct).
   
   - **Test Case 3:** `5 5 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`, so it skips the first condition.
     - `A % 2 == 0` is false, so it goes to the else block.
     - `X = 5 // 2 = 2`, so it prints `2 * 9 + 5 = 23`.
     - **Output:** `23` (Correct).
   
   - **Test Case 4:** `6 5 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`, so it skips the first condition.
     - `A % 2 == 0` is true, so it prints `int(6 * 9 / 2) = 27`.
     - **Output:** `27` (Correct).
   
   - **Test Case 5:** `7 5 9`
     - `B * 2 = 10` which is not less than `C = 9`, so it skips the first condition.
     - `A % 2 == 0` is false, so it goes to the else block.
     - `X = 7 // 2 = 3`, so it prints `3 * 9 + 5 = 32`.
     - **Output:** `32` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the program logic, the annotations, and the verification with various test cases, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

**Final:** **True**
