Postcondition: **`tt` remains greater than 0. `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, with `y` potentially reduced. `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input. `ii` is incremented by 2. `tmp` contains all valid `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` values. `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
