To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze whether the approach taken in the code aligns with the objective of maximizing the beauty of the array.

### Problem Recap:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

### Optimal Strategy:
To achieve the maximum beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order. This way, the difference between each consecutive pair of elements will be maximized, leading to the highest possible sum of these differences.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It sorts the array and then prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
While sorting the array is a good step towards maximizing the beauty, simply printing the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not yield the correct result. The beauty of the array is the sum of all differences between consecutive elements, not just the difference between the first and last elements.

### Correct Approach:
To compute the maximum beauty, after sorting the array, you should calculate the sum of differences between each consecutive pair of elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]
However, this is only part of the sum of all differences, not the complete sum.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array because it only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, rather than summing up all the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
