The given code snippet only modifies the variable `cnt` by incrementing it by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `ss` is the next element in the list `s`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `ans` remain unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
