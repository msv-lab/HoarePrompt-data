The code assigns the value of `i` to `k`. No other variables are modified. Given that `i` is `i + 2` from the initial state, the new value of `k` will be `i + 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `res` is the new string input by the user, `i` is `i + 2`, `k` is `i + 2`.**
