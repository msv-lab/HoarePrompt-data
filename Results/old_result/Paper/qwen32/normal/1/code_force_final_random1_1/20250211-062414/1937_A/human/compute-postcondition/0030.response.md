Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
