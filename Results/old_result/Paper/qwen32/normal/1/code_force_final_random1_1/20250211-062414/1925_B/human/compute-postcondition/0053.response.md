The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `n`. This means the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input provided, while `q` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `ans` is the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d >= 0` and `(x - n * d) % d == 0`.**
