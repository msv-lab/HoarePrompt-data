To determine the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the variables involved:

1. **Variable Initialization and Conditions**:
   - `i` is initialized to `0`.
   - `d2` is a dictionary that has been populated with values for keys from `1` to `n - 2` based on specific conditions:
     - If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`.
     - Otherwise, `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
   - `m` is greater than `0`.
   - `x` and `y` are new input integers.
   - `j` is set to `2`.
   - There is a conditional check on `x` and `y`: if `y > x`, then `y` remains greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d2` Calculation**:
   - The dictionary `d2` is built iteratively from `i = n - 2` to `i = 1` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l` and the previously computed values in `d2`.
   - The exact values of `d2[i]` depend on the specific values in the list `l` and how they satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Analyzing the Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` computes the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.
   - Since `d2` is computed based on the list `l` and the conditions mentioned, the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` cannot be determined without knowing the list `l`.
   - However, the expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` represents the difference between these two computed values.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement will be the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`, where these values are determined by the list `l` and the specified conditions.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are values computed based on the list l and the given conditions)**
