Given the code snippet `j += 1`, the only variable that gets updated is `j`. The variable `j` is part of the list `c`, which is defined as `[0, j, j]`. After incrementing `j`, the list `c` will reflect this change.

Here's the breakdown:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `c` will now be `[0, j+1, j+1]`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]` where `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `x`, `c` is `[0, j+1, j+1]`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.
