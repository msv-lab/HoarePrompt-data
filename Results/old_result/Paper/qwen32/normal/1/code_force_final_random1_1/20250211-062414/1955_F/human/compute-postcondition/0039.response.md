To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4` are integers between 0 and 200.
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is calculated as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `cnt` is derived from the list `a` where each element `x` in `a` is divided by 2 using `math.floor(x / 2)`, and then all these results are summed up.
- Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`.
- However, we can describe `cnt` precisely based on the given information.

### Explanation:
The `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all x in the list a)**
