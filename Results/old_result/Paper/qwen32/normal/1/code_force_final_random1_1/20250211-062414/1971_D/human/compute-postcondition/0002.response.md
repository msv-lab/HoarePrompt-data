The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means the original value of `s` is overwritten by the new input string. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.**
