In the given task, the loop is controlled by the variable `n` in the `range(n)` function. The variables `t`, `s`, and `n` are mentioned, but according to the instructions, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which is `i` and `n`.

Let's analyze the situation:

- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `n`.
- The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value before entering the loop is not explicitly set, but it will take the values generated by `range(n)` starting from 0.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`. The variable `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `n` must be greater than 0**
