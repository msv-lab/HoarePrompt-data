Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 2`), `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next `q` elements being `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions inside the loop, and the last two elements being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, and `mp` now contains `{(0): [0]}`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line such that `int(data[idx - 2])` (which is `n`) is at least 1 and `int(data[idx - 1])` (which is `q`) is greater than 0. `t` is an integer value greater than 0. `idx` is calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 1`. `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements. `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`. `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`. `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, and now `mp[pf[i]]` includes the index `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `n` is at least 1, `q` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `idx` is calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, and `mp[pf[2]]` is now `[2]`, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `n` is at least 1, `q` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `idx` is calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 2 + 1`, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[3]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `pf[1] ^ a[2]` and `pf[3]` which is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[2]]` is `[2]` and `mp[pf[3]]` is `[3]`, `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
