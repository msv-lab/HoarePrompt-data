Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `i` remains unchanged. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged.**
