The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in a list named `l`. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]`; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
