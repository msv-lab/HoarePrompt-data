The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i + 2` of the array `a`. Given that `i` is 4 and `opNum` is 0, the element at index `4 + 2 = 6` of the array `a` will be decremented by 0. Since decrementing by 0 does not change the value, `a[6]` retains its previous value.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, `opNum`, and `stop`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 6, `a[4]` is 0, `a[5]` retains its previous value, `a[6]` retains its previous value, `opNum` is 0, `stop` retains its previous value (either True or False).**
