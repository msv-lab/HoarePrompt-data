Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the new string provided as input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\). `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`. `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input. `s` is a non-empty string provided as input. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is set to `ss`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `cur` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty string. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\). If `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\), then `i` is 1 if `cnt + 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to include `ss`. If `cur` does not equal \((1 << k) - 1\), `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `ss` is the next element in the list `s`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss` remain unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
