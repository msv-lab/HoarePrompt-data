The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0` and `n` must be greater than `0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's how the state should look at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, it will be `1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `i` is `1`, and `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], 0), 0]`. If `suf[1] < smin[0]`, then `smin` is updated to `[0, suf[1], 0]`; otherwise, `smin` remains `[0, 0, 0]`. `n` must be greater than 0.**
