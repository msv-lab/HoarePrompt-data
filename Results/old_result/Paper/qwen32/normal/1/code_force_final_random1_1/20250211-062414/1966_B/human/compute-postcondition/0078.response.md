The given code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. This change affects the value of `impossible` while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the last character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True. `ans` is 'NO' in both cases. `impossible` is False.**
