### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them to that color.

The provided program checks the following conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color:

1. **Initial Check:** If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors, it proceeds to check further conditions.
2. **Horizontal Consistency:** It checks if all adjacent squares in the first row (`gr[0][j]` and `gr[0][j+1]`) and the last row (`gr[n-1][j]` and `gr[n-1][j+1]`) have the same color. If there is any pair of adjacent squares with different colors in either row, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
3. **Vertical Consistency:** Similarly, it checks if all adjacent squares in the first column (`gr[i][0]` and `gr[i+1][0]`) and the last column (`gr[i][m-1]` and `gr[i+1][m-1]`) have the same color. If there is any pair of adjacent squares with different colors in either column, it sets `impossible` to `False`.

If `impossible` remains `True` after checking both horizontal and vertical consistency, it concludes that it's not possible to make all squares the same color and sets the answer to `'NO'`. Otherwise, it defaults to `'YES'`.

However, this logic is flawed. The program only checks the edges of the grid and assumes that if the edges are consistent, the entire grid can be made uniform. This is not necessarily true. There could be inconsistencies within the grid that are not detected by just checking the edges.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
WBB
BBW
BWW
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same ('W'), but it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the allowed operations because there are no two adjacent squares of the same color that can be used to propagate the color throughout the grid.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and can give incorrect results for certain grid configurations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
