Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing two identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation: The `results` list initially contains one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. After executing `results.append(winner)`, another element, which is also the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, is added to the `results` list. Therefore, `results` now contains two identical elements. The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and `winner` remain unchanged.
