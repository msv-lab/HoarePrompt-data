The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the variable `score` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is `i + 2` before this line, it means `i` has already been updated to point to the next even index (considering the initial value of `i`).

Since `l` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is an index that has been incremented by 2, the value at `l[i]` is added to `score`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the condition that `l` is sorted remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 2`, `score` is `score + l[i]`.**
