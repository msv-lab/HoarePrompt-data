Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers where the element at index `j` and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped; `h` is the first element of the list `s`; `j` is the index of the first element in `s[1:]` that is greater than `h`, or `len(s) - 2` if no such element exists; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is equal to `j`; `ans1` is 0; `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers with at least one element where the element at index `j` and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped; `h` is the first element of the list `s`; `j` is the index of the first element in `s[1:]` that is greater than `h`, or `len(s) - 2` if no such element exists; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is equal to `j`. If `i` equals `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0, and `z` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers with at least one element where the element at index `j` and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped; `h` is the first element of the list `s`; `j` is the index of the first element in `s[1:]` that is greater than `h`, or `len(s) - 2` if no such element exists; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is equal to `j`; `i` is the next element in the list `s` after its current value. If `i` equals `h`, `ans1` is set to 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` does not equal `h` and `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` does not equal `h` and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and `z` equals 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers with at least one element where the element at index `j` and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped; `h` is the first element of the list `s`; `j` is the index of the first element in `s[1:]` that is greater than `h`, or `len(s) - 2` if no such element exists; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is equal to `j`; `i` is the next element in the list `s` after its current value. If `i == h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 and `z` is set to 1. If `i != h` and `i > h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i != h`, `i <= h`, and `z == 1`, then `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
