The given Python code snippet initializes a new variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `cnt` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the string provided by the input, `cnt` is 0.**
