Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `res` is an input string (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is defined as `n-1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The string `'?'` is explicitly provided.
- The number `0` is explicitly provided.
- The variable `k` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- Another `0` is explicitly provided.
- The variable `i` is defined as `n`, so it will print the value of `n`.
- `flush=True` ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will include the string `'?'`, two zeros, the undefined variable `k`, and the value of `n`.

Output: **? 0 k 0 n (where k is an undefined variable and n is a value greater than 2)**
