n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and there are exactly two leaves in the tree. The last line contains t integers (u_1), where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node of the stone for each round.
