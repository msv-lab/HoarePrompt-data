The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a list `resultats` where each element corresponds to the result of a test case based on specific conditions related to the total points and individual player scores. If the conditions are not met, the result for that test case is `-1`.
