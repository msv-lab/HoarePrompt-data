Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

Given Initial State:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `l = 0`
- `r = 2`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`
- `l` is not equal to 0
- `a = 3`
- `b = 2 * i`

However, there is no explicit value given for `i` in the initial state. Since `b` is defined as `2 * i`, we need to know the value of `i` to compute `b`.

Assuming `i` is a variable that could be any integer, let's consider if there are any constraints or typical values for `i` based on the context. Given the indices and ranges mentioned (`l`, `r`), it's reasonable to assume `i` might be within the range `[0, n-1]` where `n` is the length of lists `A` and `B` (which is 3 in this case).

For the sake of providing a concrete answer, let's assume `i` is `1` (a common middle index for a list of length 3). This assumption allows us to proceed with the calculation.

Given `i = 1`:
- `b = 2 * i = 2 * 1 = 2`

Now, we can calculate the expression inside the `print` statement:
- `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`
- Substituting the values: `3 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 1 + 1`
- Simplifying: `6 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12`

Therefore, the `print` statement will output `12` followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **12 **
