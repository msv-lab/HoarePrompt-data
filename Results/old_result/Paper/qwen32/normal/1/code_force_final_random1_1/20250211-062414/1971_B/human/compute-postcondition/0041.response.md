Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already the smallest.**
