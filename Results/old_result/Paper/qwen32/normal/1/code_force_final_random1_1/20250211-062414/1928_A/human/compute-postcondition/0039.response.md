The code assigns `a1` and `a2` the value of `a // 2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` is incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1; `a1` is `a // 2`; `a2` is `a // 2`.**
