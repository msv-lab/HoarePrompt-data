To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

From the loop definition, we know that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 each iteration until it reaches `2 * n`.

Let's analyze the state:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2, so for the next iteration, `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 2.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Since `i` is incremented by 2 at the end of each iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `i + 2`.

Given that `score` is calculated as `2 * l[i]`, this calculation does not affect the loop head variables (`i` and `n`). Therefore, `score` does not need to be adjusted in the state description for the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 2`**
