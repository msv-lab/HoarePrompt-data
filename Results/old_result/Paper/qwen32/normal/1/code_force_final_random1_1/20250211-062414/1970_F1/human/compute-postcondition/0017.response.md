The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is either 0 or 1, the tuple will be added to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]`.

Since `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and 1 otherwise, and the second character of the string at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', the specific list within `goal` that gets updated depends on the first character of `line[ind]`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `points`, and `line` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `goal` list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1), `line[ind]`: (i, ind)}; `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is a list of two lists where one list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` and the other remains empty; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; the current element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..' and is not a player; the second character of the string at index `ind` in `line` is 'G'; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
