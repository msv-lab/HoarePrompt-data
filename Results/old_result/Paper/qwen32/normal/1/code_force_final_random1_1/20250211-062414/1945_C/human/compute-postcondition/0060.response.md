Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 4, `s` is "0101", `pk` is 2, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least two indices (e.g., [1, 3]), `mini` is 1, `final` is either [] or [1] depending on whether `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is false or true, `elem` is 1.**
