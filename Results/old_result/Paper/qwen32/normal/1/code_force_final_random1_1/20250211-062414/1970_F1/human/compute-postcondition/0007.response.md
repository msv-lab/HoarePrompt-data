The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. This list is stored in the variable `line`. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `line`, which contains the split input from the user.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping strings to tuples of integers representing the positions of entities on the field, and now `elements` is {'B': (-1, -1)}; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of two empty lists; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively, and now `points` is [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line of input.**
