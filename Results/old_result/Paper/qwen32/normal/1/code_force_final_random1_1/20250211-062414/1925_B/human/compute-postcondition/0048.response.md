Postcondition: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `input_x // 3`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.**
