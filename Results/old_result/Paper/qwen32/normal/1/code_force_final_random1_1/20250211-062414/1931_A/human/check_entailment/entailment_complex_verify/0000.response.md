### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program's logic and compare it with the problem requirements using the annotated code and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) into a lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.
- Each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26 (a=1, z=26).
- The sum of these numbers should equal `n`.

#### Program Logic:
The provided program uses the following logic:
1. If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
2. If `n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
3. Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Let's verify this logic step-by-step:

1. **Minimum Value (`n = 3`)**:
   - Expected: `'aaa'` (1 + 1 + 1)
   - Actual: `'aa' + alphabet[0]` → `'aaa'`
   - This works correctly.

2. **Middle Values (`27 ≤ n ≤ 52`)**:
   - For `n = 27`, expected: `'aab'` (1 + 1 + 25)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[-1] + 'z'` → `'azz'` (incorrect)
     - Here, `alphabet[-1]` refers to the last character of the alphabet, which is `'z'`, not `'b'`.
   - For `n = 28`, expected: `'aac'` (1 + 1 + 26)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z'` → `'aaz'` (incorrect)
     - Here, `alphabet[0]` refers to `'a'`, not `'c'`.
   - For `n = 29`, expected: `'aad'` (1 + 1 + 27)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[1] + 'z'` → `'abz'` (correct)
     - Here, `alphabet[1]` refers to `'b'`, not `'d'`.

3. **Maximum Value (`n = 78`)**:
   - Expected: `'zzz'` (26 + 26 + 26)
   - Actual: `alphabet[25] + 'zz'` → `'zzz'`
   - This works correctly.

4. **General Case (`53 ≤ n ≤ 78`)**:
   - For `n = 53`, expected: `'aaz'` (1 + 1 + 26)
   - Actual: `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` → `'azz'` (incorrect)
     - Here, `alphabet[0]` refers to `'a'`, not `'a'` (but the second `'a'` is missing).
   - For `n = 54`, expected: `'aba'` (1 + 2 + 25)
   - Actual: `alphabet[1] + 'zz'` → `'bzz'` (incorrect)
     - Here, `alphabet[1]` refers to `'b'`, not `'a'`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is flawed for several ranges of `n`:
- For `n = 27` and `n = 28`, the program incorrectly calculates the middle letter.
- For `n = 53` and `n = 54`, the program incorrectly calculates the first letter and does not handle the second letter properly.

### Final Answer:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases and thus does not produce the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`.

Final: **False**
