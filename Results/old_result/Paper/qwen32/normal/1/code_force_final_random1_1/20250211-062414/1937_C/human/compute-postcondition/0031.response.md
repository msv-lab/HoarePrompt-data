Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 1 if no such index exists, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the new input value, and `best` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
