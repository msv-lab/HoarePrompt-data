To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code execution step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input, representing the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input.
- `_` is the current iteration count incremented by 1, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Explanation:
1. **`nums[:-1]`**: This slice operation returns a new list containing all elements of `nums` except the last one.
2. **`max(nums[:-1])`**: This function call finds the maximum value in the list `nums` excluding the last element.
3. **`nums[-1]`**: This accesses the last element of the list `nums`.
4. **`max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`**: This expression adds the maximum value from the list excluding the last element to the last element itself.

### Output Description:
The code will print the result of adding the maximum value from the list `nums` (excluding the last element) to the last element of the list.

Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `n` and `nums`, so we cannot compute the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **the sum of the maximum value in the list `nums` (excluding the last element) and the last element of the list `nums`**.
