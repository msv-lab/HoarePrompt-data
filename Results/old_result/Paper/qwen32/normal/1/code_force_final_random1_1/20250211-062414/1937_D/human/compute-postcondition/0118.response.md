The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. Since `i` is the loop variable and `n` is the upper limit of the loop, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- Depending on the value of `s[i]`, various conditions and assignments are made to `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken some value, and for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `b`) do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1**
