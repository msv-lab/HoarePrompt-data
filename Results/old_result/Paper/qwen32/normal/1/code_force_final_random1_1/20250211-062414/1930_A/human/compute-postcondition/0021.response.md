The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given that `i` is defined as `i_end + 4`, the specific value of `l[i]` depends on the contents of `l` and the value of `i_end`.

Since `l` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is `i_end + 4`, the value of `l[i]` will be the integer at position `i_end + 4` in the sorted list `l`. The value of `score` will be updated to its current value plus `l[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged except for `score`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i_end + 4`, `score` is updated to `score + l[i_end + 4]`.**
