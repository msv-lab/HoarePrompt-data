The given code snippet initializes `d2` as a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `m`, or `j`. It only changes the state of `d2`.

Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than `0`, `j` is `m - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that `d2` is now a `defaultdict` where all keys not explicitly set will have a value of `0`. All other variables retain their initial values.
