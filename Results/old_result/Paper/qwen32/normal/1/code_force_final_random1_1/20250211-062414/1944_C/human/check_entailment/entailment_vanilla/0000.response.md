Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Players take turns picking elements from `a`, appending them to `c` (only for Alice), and deleting them from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The goal is to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Key Observations:
1. **Optimal Strategy**: Since Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice will try to include as many lower numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX. Bob, on the other hand, will try to prevent Alice from including certain numbers to minimize the MEX.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. To maximize the MEX, Alice should aim to fill the array `c` with consecutive integers starting from 0.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
- It uses a function `func_1` to calculate the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
- Inside `func_1`, it counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using `collections.Counter`.
- It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.
- It iterates through the numbers starting from 0, decrementing their count in the counter and moving to the next number if the next number is also present.
- If the next number is not present, it prints the current number + 1 as the MEX and exits.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic of finding the MEX is correct. The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after the game ends.
- However, the program does not simulate the actual game where Alice and Bob take turns. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX based on the initial array `a`. This works because the optimal strategy for both players can be deduced without simulating the game explicitly.
- The program handles the constraints efficiently, using a counter to count occurrences and iterating through the numbers up to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
