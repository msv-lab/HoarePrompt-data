The given code snippet assigns a value to the variable `i` based on the expression `n - 1 - j`. Since the value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, we can express `i` in terms of `n` and `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = []`
- `idx_B = []`
- `n` must be greater than 0

The code modifies the state by introducing a new variable `i` which is calculated as `n - 1 - j`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [], idx_B = [], n must be greater than 0, i = n - 1 - j`**.

This means that `i` is now defined as `n - 1 - j`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
