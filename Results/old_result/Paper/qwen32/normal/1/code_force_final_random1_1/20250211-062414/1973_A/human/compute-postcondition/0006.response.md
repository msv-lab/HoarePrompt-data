Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple. If `total_points` (which is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`) is odd, `resultats` is a list containing the single element [-1]. Otherwise, `resultats` remains an empty list.**
