To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, the string was constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on some conditions involving `sa`.

Let's break it down:

1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is currently at some value, let's say `k`, meaning the loop just finished executing for `i = k`.
   - `n` is the total number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to `n` or any other variables outside the loop head, `n` stays the same.

**Answer:**
State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we can generalize it as follows:

State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same**.

For clarity, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same**

But sticking to the general form without assuming a specific `k`:

State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the same**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` with '?' replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**.
