Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, each element of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will have been assigned an integer value from the input. The `visited` list remains unchanged with all elements set to `False`, and the `coef` list remains as a list of `None` values.
