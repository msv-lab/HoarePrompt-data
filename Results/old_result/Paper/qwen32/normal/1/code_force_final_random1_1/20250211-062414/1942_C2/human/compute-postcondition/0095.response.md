Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `ii` is incremented by 2; `tmp` is an empty list; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2; the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
