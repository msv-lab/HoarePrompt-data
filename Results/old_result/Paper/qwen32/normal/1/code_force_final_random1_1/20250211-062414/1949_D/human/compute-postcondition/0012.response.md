The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` in the list `b` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b[i]`, which increases by 1 from its initial value of 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `b[i]` which is now 1, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the input string, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'**.
