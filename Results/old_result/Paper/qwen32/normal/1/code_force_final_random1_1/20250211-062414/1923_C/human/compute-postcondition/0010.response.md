Given the code `i += x`, the value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, after executing the code, `i` will be equal to `x`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
