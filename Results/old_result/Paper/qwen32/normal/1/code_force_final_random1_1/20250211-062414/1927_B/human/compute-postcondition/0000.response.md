To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

However, the loop in question only depends on the input value, which should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and it is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, the loop will definitely execute because `t` will always be greater than 0.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop will run since `t` (which is the input value) is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to 10^4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
