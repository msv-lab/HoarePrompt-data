Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` contains only one element, then no further changes are made. Otherwise, `lis` includes the number 1 and has a length greater than 1; `test` is True if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1; `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. If `test` is True, the length of `lis` is either odd or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `test` is True if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1; `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. If `1` is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, `test` retains its original value. If `1` is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is True, and `j` is the length of `lis`, which is either odd or even. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `test` is True if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1; `j` is the length of `lis`; `i` is incremented by 1. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then `test` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `test` is True and `j` is len(`lis`) - 1. Additionally, if `test` is True, the length of `lis` is either odd or even.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
