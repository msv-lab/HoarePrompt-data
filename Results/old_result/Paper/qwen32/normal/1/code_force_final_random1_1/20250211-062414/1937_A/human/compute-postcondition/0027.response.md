To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`.
- `power` is initialized to 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop condition).

The loop condition is:
```
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `n`. Given that `power` is initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`, we need `t` to be greater than 2 to ensure `n > 1`. The smallest integer `t` that satisfies this condition is 3 (since log2(3) > 1).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
