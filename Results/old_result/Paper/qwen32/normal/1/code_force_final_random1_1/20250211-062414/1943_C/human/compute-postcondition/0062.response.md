The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `i` is 3, the new tuple added will be `(c2, 3)`. 

Since `c2` and `i` are not modified by the code, their values remain the same. The only change is that `ops` now contains four elements instead of three.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 2 and even; `ops` is a list containing four elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3)]`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 3.**
