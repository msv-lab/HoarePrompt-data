The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Since the code only affects the variable `n` and does not modify `t` or `s`, the values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided as input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input integer.**
