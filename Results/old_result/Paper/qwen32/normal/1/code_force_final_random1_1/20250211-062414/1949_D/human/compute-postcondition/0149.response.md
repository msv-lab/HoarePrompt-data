In the given task, the loop head involves the variable `j` and the range `(1, n + 1)`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, n + 1)` contains at least one value, which means `n` must be at least 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will iterate from `1` to `n` inclusive.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.
3. The initial value of `j` before entering the loop is not specified in the loop head, but it will be set to `1` during the first iteration.
4. The variable `i` is mentioned as being `n`, but since `i` is not part of the loop head, its value does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least `1`.

State: **the final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is '', `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`**
