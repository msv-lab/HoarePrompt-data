You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, there is at least one a_i equal to 1.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: the count of '0's in the substring `z` from the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move chips in such a way that they form a contiguous block with no free cells between them. The operation allowed is moving a chip to the nearest free cell to its left. The task is to find the minimum number of such operations required.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of cells `n`.
2. Reads the configuration of cells as a string of '0's and '1's, representing free cells and chips respectively.
3. Finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the left (`x`).
4. Finds the index of the first '1' from the right (`y`), which is actually the distance from the end to the last '1'.
5. Extracts the substring `z` from the first '1' to the last '1' inclusive.
6. Counts the number of '0's in this substring `z` and prints it.

### Logic Evaluation:
- **Finding the First Chip (`x`)**: This is correctly done using `arr.find('1')`, which gives the index of the first '1' from the left.
- **Finding the Last Chip (`y`)**: The code uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` which finds the index of the first '1' in the reversed string. This index corresponds to the distance from the end to the last '1'. To get the actual index of the last '1', we should use `n - y - 1`.
- **Extracting the Substring (`z`)**: The substring `z` is supposed to be from the first '1' to the last '1'. However, due to the incorrect calculation of `y`, the substring might not be correctly defined.
- **Counting Free Cells (`z.count('0')`)**: The count of '0's in the substring `z` is intended to give the minimum number of operations needed to bring all chips together. However, since `y` is incorrectly calculated, the substring `z` may not cover the correct range of cells.

### Conclusion:
The logic for finding the first and last chip positions is flawed because `y` is not correctly converted to the actual index of the last chip. As a result, the substring `z` may not include all the cells between the first and last chips, leading to an incorrect count of the required operations.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not always produce the correct output for all possible configurations of chips and free cells.

**Correctness: False**
