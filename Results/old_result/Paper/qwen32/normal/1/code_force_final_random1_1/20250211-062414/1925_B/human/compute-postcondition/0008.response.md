Postcondition: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is `max(1, i)` if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * i) % i` is 0; otherwise, `ans` remains 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.**
