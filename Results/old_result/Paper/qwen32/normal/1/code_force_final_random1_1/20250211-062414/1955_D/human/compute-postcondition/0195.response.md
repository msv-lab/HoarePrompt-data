Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 3 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, otherwise `curr` remains 2; `cnt_b` has its counts incremented by 1 for each element `b[i]` except `a[i]` which is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is further decremented by 1; `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2.**
