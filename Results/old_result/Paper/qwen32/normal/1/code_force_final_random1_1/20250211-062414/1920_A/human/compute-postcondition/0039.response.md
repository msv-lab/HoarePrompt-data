To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variables `start`, `end`, and `num` are updated based on the constraints provided by the input values `t` and `v` over `n` iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `n`: The number of iterations (2 <= n <= 100).
  - `start`: Initially set to -1.
  - `end`: Initially set to 1000000000.0.
  - `num`: Initially an empty list.
  - `t`: Constraint type (1, 2, or 3).
  - `v`: Value associated with the constraint.

- **Loop Body:**
  - For each iteration `i` in the range `n`:
    - Read `t` and `v` from input.
    - If `t == 1` and `start < v`, update `start` to `v`.
    - If `t == 2` and `end > v`, update `end` to `v`.
    - If `t == 3`, append `v` to the list `num`.

### Final Output State:
After `n` iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations.
- `start`: The maximum value encountered when `t == 1`.
- `end`: The minimum value encountered when `t == 2`.
- `num`: A list containing all values `v` where `t == 3`.
- `t` and `v`: These will hold the last values read from the input during the loop, but they are not part of the final output state as per the problem statement.

### Output State Description:
- `start` will be the largest value among all `v` where `t == 1` encountered during the iterations.
- `end` will be the smallest value among all `v` where `t == 2` encountered during the iterations.
- `num` will be a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered during the iterations.

### Final Output State Format:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered.**

This format ensures that the state of `n` remains unchanged, while `start`, `end`, and `num` reflect the aggregated results of all iterations.
