Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is 3; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` is set to 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, and `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are adjusted according to whether `i` is in `a` or `b` and their respective values relative to `newk`.**
