To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(int(ans))`, we need to understand the value of the variable `ans` from the initial state. However, the initial state does not provide any explicit value or definition for `ans`.

Given this, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `ans` itself:

- `int(ans)`: This indicates that the value of `ans` will be converted to an integer before being printed.

Since the exact value of `ans` is not specified, we can only say that the output will be the integer representation of whatever value `ans` holds.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the value of the variable ans converted to an integer)**
