The given code snippet sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. The initial state specifies that `cnt_b[i]` was previously 0, and `b_values` must contain at least two elements. Since the operation does not change the value of `cnt_b[i]` from its initial state (it remains 0), there is no actual change in the state of `cnt_b[i]`. However, the code implies that `i` refers to the next element in `b_values` after the one just processed.

Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements; `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
