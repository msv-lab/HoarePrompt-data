To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit upper limit `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is 2
- `x` is at least 1
- `n` is the second integer from the input
- `ans` is calculated based on certain conditions involving `x` and `i`

The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. After the previous iteration, `i` was 2 (since it's mentioned `q` is 2, and typically `q` would represent the current value of `i`).

For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `ans`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`q` is 3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `ans` is determined as follows: if `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is `max(max(1, i), x // i)` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`; otherwise, `ans` is `max(1, i)` if `(x - n * i) >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains 1.**
