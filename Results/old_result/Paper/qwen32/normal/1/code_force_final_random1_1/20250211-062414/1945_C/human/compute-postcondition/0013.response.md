The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `lst`. No other variables are modified in the given code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, and `one` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input provided by the user; `pk` is set to `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**
