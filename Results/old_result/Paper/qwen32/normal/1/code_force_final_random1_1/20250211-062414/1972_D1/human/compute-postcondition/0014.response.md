Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + k) // (k * k)` for all `k` from 1 to `i-1`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers with constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, although `m` is not used in the calculation.**
