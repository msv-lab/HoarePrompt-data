Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is the integer read from the input; l is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; lis is a sorted list of unique integers from l; test is True; j is equal to the length of lis. If the length of lis is odd, lis has an odd number of elements. If the length of lis is even, lis has an even number of elements.**
