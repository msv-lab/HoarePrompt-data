### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, let's carefully analyze the logic and the conditions used in the code. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The critical time point to check is `min(a, b) + m` because beyond this point, fireworks from both installations would have started their visibility periods multiple times.
   - We need to count the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible up to `min(a, b) + m`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Number of fireworks from the first installation visible up to `min(a, b) + m`: `(min(a, b) + m) // a`
   - Number of fireworks from the second installation visible up to `min(a, b) + m`: `(min(a, b) + m) // b`

4. **Additional Condition**:
   - The provided solution includes an additional condition to add 1 if `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
   - This condition is intended to account for an additional overlap at the exact `min(a, b) + m` point, but it is overly restrictive and not generally correct.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `m = 5`. The critical point is `min(2, 3) + 5 = 7`.
   - Fireworks visible up to this point:
     - From the first installation: at times 2, 4, 6 (3 fireworks).
     - From the second installation: at times 3, 6 (2 fireworks).
     - Total fireworks visible at the same time: 3 (at time 6).
   - The provided solution would calculate `(7 // 2) + (7 // 3) = 3 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap correctly.

6. **General Case**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there are overlaps that are not captured by the additional condition.
   - The additional condition is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there are overlaps that are not captured by the additional condition. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the solution is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
