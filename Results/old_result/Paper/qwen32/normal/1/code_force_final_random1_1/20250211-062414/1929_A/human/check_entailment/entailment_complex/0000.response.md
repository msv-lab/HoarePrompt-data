### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of maximizing the beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This can be achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. 

One effective strategy is to sort the array and then consider the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, this simple approach does not necessarily maximize the sum of all differences. Instead, we should aim to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty is to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements. For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the optimal arrangement would be [1, 5, 2, 4, 3] which yields the maximum beauty.

However, the provided code simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty as defined in the problem statement.

Let's consider the first example in the problem statement:
- Input: 3, [2, 1, 3]
- Sorted: [1, 2, 3]
- Calculated Beauty (max-min): 3 - 1 = 2
- Optimal Arrangement: [1, 3, 2] or [3, 1, 2] both yield beauty: (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 or (1-3) + (2-1) = 2

In this specific case, the provided code happens to give the correct answer, but it is not a general solution. For other cases, it might not yield the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
