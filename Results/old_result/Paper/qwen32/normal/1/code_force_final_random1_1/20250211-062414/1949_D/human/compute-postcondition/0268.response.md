Output State: **`nx` is a string containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`; `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `nx`, which was initially an empty string, now contains the character located at `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, with `i` still being equal to `n` and `n` being at least 1. The condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' is still valid.
