The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but this operation does not influence the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'yes'`, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **yes**
