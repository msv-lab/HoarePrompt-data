The function `func_13` computes the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `x` and `y` are the coefficients such that `ax + by = g`, and `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.
