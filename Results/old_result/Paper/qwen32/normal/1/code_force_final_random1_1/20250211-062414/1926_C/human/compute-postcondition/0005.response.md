The code modifies the variable `a` by adding the last digit of the current `num` to it. Since the initial state specifies that `num` has already had its last digit removed, `num % 10` would now yield 0 because `num` effectively ends in 0 after the last digit was stripped off.

Thus, `a` is updated to `a + 0`, which means `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^5 (with the last digit removed), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
