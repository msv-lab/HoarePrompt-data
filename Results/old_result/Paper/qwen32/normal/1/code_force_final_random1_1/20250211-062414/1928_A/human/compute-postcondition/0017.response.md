The provided initial state includes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) with specific descriptions. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('yes')`, it will output the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **yes**
