Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its behavior against the problem description and the function summaries.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation multiple times. The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and then setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- **Purpose**: To recursively process a subarray and ensure it is maximized according to the MEX rule.
- **Issues**:
  - When `l == r`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if it is not already 0. This contradicts the goal of maximizing the sum.
  - It then calls itself recursively for the subarray `(l + 1, r)`.
  - If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`. This step is problematic because it does not correctly compute the MEX value.

#### Function `func_2(a)`
- **Purpose**: To initialize the process of maximizing the sum.
- **Issues**:
  - Calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` without passing the `ops` list, leading to a `NameError` since `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- **Purpose**: To recursively split the array and apply the MEX operation.
- **Issues**:
  - Uses a local variable `s` to store the sum of the segment, which is unnecessary.
  - Attempts to modify `ops` directly, but `ops` is not passed as an argument, causing a `NameError`.
  - The logic for splitting the array and applying the MEX operation is flawed. It checks if the sum of the segment is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` and then applies a heuristic to set all elements to `r - l + 1`. This does not correctly compute the MEX value.

#### Function `func_3()`
- **Purpose**: To read input, process the array using `func_2`, and print the result.
- **Issues**:
  - Relies on `func_2` to correctly process the array, but `func_2` has issues as described above.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the code has several critical issues:
- Incorrect handling of the MEX value.
- Flawed logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- Missing arguments in function calls, leading to runtime errors.

These issues mean that the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and will likely produce incorrect results for many test cases.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
