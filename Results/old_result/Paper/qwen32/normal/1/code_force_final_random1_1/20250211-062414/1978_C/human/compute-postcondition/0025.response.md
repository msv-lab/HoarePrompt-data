To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is defined as `n - 4`.
- `k` is defined as `k - n + 3`. However, there seems to be a circular reference here because `k` is defined in terms of itself. We'll assume that the initial value of `k` is provided or set elsewhere in the code, but for the purpose of this task, we'll consider its final value after the operation.
- `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`. This suggests that `l` is initially passed to `func_3` with an argument of `2`, and the result is stored back in `l`.
- `c` is `3`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return func_2(c, k, l)
```

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the program will return the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Here, `c` is `3`, `k` is the result of `k - n + 3`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `l` depend on their initial states and the functions `func_2` and `func_3`, we cannot compute specific numerical values without additional information. However, we can describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`, where `k` is the result of `k - n + 3` and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`**.
