The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. Since `ops` must contain at least two tuples, and the current iteration has just finished processing the second tuple, the loop can execute one more time if there are more tuples in `ops`.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is `l_next` (the first element of the second tuple in `ops`), and `r` is `r_next` (the second element of the second tuple in `ops`). For the loop to execute one more time, `l` and `r` should be updated to the values from the third tuple in `ops`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `l` is the first element of the third tuple in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the third tuple in `ops`**
