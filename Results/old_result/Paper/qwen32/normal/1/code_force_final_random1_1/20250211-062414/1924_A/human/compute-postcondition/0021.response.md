The given code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
