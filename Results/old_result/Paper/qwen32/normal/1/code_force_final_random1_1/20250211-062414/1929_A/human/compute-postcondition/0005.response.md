To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). This represents the number of integers in the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- `ntest` must be greater than 0 (though `ntest` is not used in the provided code snippet).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Analysis:
- `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, which is the largest element because `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- `a[0]` refers to the first element of the list `a`, which is the smallest element because `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a` (where the largest element is `a[len(a) - 1]` and the smallest element is `a[0]`)**
