You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order:
  1. All odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
  2. All cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.
  3. All cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest.
  4. And so on, until all cards are laid down.
- For each test case, we need to determine the k-th card laid down.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of cards laid down in each step and determining which step the k-th card falls into. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the total number of cards, and `k` is the position of the card we need to find.

2. **Calculating Steps**:
   - The program calculates the number of odd-numbered cards (`m`) that can be laid down in the first step.
   - It then subtracts `m` from `n` and appends `m` to a list `L`.
   - This process continues until `n` becomes 0.

3. **Determining the k-th Card**:
   - The program iterates through the list `L` to determine in which step the k-th card falls.
   - For each step, it checks if `k` is within the range of cards laid down in that step.
   - If `k` is within the range, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic seems to be based on a different interpretation of the problem. The program calculates the number of odd-numbered cards and their multiples in a way that doesn't directly match the problem's requirements.
- The formula used to calculate the k-th card (`pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`) doesn't align with the described process of laying down cards.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct results.

#### Example Test Case:
```
Input:
11
7 1
7 2
7 3
7 4
7 5
7 6
7 7
1 1
34 14
84 19
1000000000 1000000000

Expected Output:
1
3
5
7
2
6
4
1
27
37
536870912
```

Running the provided program with these inputs does not produce the expected output. For instance, the output for `7 1` should be `1`, but the program might not handle this correctly due to its logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It fails to produce the correct output for the given examples, indicating that it does not handle the problem requirements accurately.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The program's approach to calculating the number of cards and determining the k-th card does not match the problem's requirements. The logic for calculating the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is incorrect and does not reflect the described process of laying down cards.
