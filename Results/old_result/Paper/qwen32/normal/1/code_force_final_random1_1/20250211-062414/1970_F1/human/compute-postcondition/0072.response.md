The code appends the current `line` to the `grid`. This means the length of `grid` increases by one, and the last element of `grid` is now the `line` that was just read.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing three elements, each being a list of strings (`line`), with the last element being the newly read `line`; `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)` for all `ind` in `range(len(line))`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 4; `line` is updated to the new list of strings read from input.**
