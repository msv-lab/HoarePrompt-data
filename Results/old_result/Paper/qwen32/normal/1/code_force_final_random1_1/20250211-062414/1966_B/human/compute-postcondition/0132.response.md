Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input string.
- Depending on the comparison between `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, different actions are taken:
  - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`:
    - `i` is set to `n-2`.
    - `j` is set to `m-2`.
    - `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`.
    - If `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is set to 'NO'; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
  - If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`:
    - `i` retains its value (`n-1`).
    - `j` retains its previous value.
    - `tc` is incremented by `n`.
    - `ans` remains 'YES'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is determined based on the comparison between `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`.

- If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `ans` will be 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`; otherwise, it will remain 'YES'.
- If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `ans` will always be 'YES'.

Given that the exact values of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` definitively. However, based on the logic described, we know that `ans` can only be either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1] or 'NO' if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1] and impossible is True)**
