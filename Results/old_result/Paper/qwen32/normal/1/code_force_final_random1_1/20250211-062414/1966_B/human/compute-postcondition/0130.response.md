Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`. If `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains as it was ('YES' if `impossible` was `False`).**
