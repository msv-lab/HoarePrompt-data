The given code writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline to the standard output. The function `func_10()` returns 1, but this does not affect the current code snippet as `func_10()` is not called.

Since the value returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output, we need to include this action in our output state. However, since the exact value returned by `func_14()` is not specified, we cannot determine its specific value. We only know that it is converted to a string and written to the output.

Output State: **The value returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output as a string followed by a newline. `func_10()` returns 1.**
