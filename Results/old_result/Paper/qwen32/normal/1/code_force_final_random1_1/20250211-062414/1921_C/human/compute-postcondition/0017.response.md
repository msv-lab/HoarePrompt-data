Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list that includes the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `i` is `i_current + 1`. The new element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` has been appended to `array2`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to `array2` based on the difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, scaled by `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
