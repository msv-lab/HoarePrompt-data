Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. This indicates the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not affect the current print statement.
- `i` is initialized to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- It is specified that `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`.

Given these conditions, we know that `m` and `n` are consecutive integers where `m` is one less than `n`. However, these specific values do not influence the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
