Functionality: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies a list `a` by potentially replacing segments of it with a constant value such that the sum of each segment equals the square of its length. It also records the operations performed in a list `ops`. The function does not return a value but alters the list `a` in place based on the conditions specified.**
