The code snippet `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` is initially `[0, i, i]`, and after appending `i`, `p` becomes `[0, i, i, i]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, and `c` is unchanged unless `x` is 1, in which case `c` is `[0, j+1, j+1]`.**

In simpler terms, the list `p` now has an additional element `i` appended to it, making its length four elements long. All other variables remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.
