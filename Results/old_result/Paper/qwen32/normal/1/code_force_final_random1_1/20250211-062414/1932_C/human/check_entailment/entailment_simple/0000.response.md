### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array), `m` (modulus), the array `a` of `n` integers, and the string `s` of `n` commands ('L' or 'R').

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:** 
     - `b` is initialized as an empty list.
     - `l` is set to 0 (left pointer).
     - `r` is set to `n-1` (right pointer).
   - **Building List `b`:**
     - The loop iterates through each command in `s`.
     - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element of `a` (pointed by `l`) is appended to `b`, and `l` is incremented.
     - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element of `a` (pointed by `r`) is appended to `b`, and `r` is decremented.
   - **Calculating Cumulative Product Modulo `m`:**
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
     - `p` is initialized to 1 (product accumulator).
     - The loop iterates through each element `v` in `b` in reverse order.
     - `p` is updated to `(p * v) % m` (cumulative product modulo `m`).
     - `p` is appended to `ans`.
   - **Returning Result:**
     - The function returns `reversed(ans)`, which gives the correct order of cumulative products modulo `m`.

3. **Output:**
   - The main loop prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Cumulative Product:**
  - The program calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, but it should calculate the cumulative product of the elements in the original array `a` in the order specified by `s`.
  - The current implementation incorrectly constructs `b` and then calculates the product of `b` in reverse order, which doesn't match the problem's requirement.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to calculate the cumulative product of the elements in `a` in the order specified by `s` without reversing `b` or `ans`.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    p = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the cumulative product calculation.

**Correctness: False**
