To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, it increments the count of `b[i]` in the `cnt_b` list by 1.

### Initial State and Given Outputs
- **Initial State:** 
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided as input.
  - `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained from the input.
  - `cnt_b` is presumably a list initialized to zero counts for each possible value in `b`.

- **After 1st Iteration:**
  - `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.

- **After 2nd Iteration:**
  - `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1.

- **After 3rd Iteration:**
  - `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State
Since the loop runs `m` times, after all iterations, the count of each element `b[i]` (for `i` ranging from 0 to `m-1`) in the `cnt_b` list will be incremented by 1.

### Conclusion
After all `m` iterations, the `cnt_b` list will reflect the frequency of each element in the `b` list up to the `m`-th element.

**Output State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the next line of input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the current line of input, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `cnt_b` list will have the count of each element in `b` up to the `m`-th element incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
