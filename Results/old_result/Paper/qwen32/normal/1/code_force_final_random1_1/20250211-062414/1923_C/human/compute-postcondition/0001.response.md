The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
