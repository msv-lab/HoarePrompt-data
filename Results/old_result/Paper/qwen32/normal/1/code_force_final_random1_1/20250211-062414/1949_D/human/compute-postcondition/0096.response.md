The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Since `sb` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `sb` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0. `sa` remains unchanged as an empty list. `sb` is a list containing the single element `i`.**
