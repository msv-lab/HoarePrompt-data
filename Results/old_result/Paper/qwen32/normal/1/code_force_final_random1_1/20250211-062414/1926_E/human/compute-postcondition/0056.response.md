Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is at least 1.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.
- `pow` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved**:
   - `pow`: This is explicitly given as 1.
   - `k`: This is at least 1.
   - `tot`: This is less than `k`.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `k - tot`: Since `tot` is less than `k`, this expression results in a positive integer.
   - `2 * (k - tot)`: This multiplies the result of `k - tot` by 2, resulting in an even positive integer.
   - `2 * (k - tot) - 1`: Subtracting 1 from an even positive integer results in an odd positive integer.
   - `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`: Since `pow` is 1, this does not change the value of the expression.

### Conclusion:
The expression inside the `print` function simplifies to an odd positive integer because `k - tot` is positive, making `2 * (k - tot) - 1` an odd positive integer. Given that `pow` is 1, the final printed value is simply `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.

### Output:
Output: **2 * (k - tot) - 1 (where k is at least 1 and tot is less than k)**
