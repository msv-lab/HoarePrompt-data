The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the new element added to `ad` is `a[3] - a[2]`.

Therefore, the updated list `ad` will now contain four elements: `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list with at least two elements (starting with 0 and followed by at least one integer read from the input); `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing the elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`; `bd` is a list containing the single element 0; `i` is 3**.
