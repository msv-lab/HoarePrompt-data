To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_2(a)` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only infer the changes based on the assignment to `s`, `m`, and `ops`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer is derived from the input.
- `n` is an input integer.

The line `s, m, ops = func_2(a)` suggests that `func_2` returns three values which are then assigned to `s`, `m`, and `ops`. Without knowing the specifics of `func_2`, we can only state that `s`, `m`, and `ops` will hold whatever values `func_2` returns.

Since `n` is not used in the given code snippet, its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will include:
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are assigned the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`**.
