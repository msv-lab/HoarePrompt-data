The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides several conditions about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers with specific constraints:
  - `n` is not equal to `m`.
  - `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
  - `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
  - Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even, but at least one of them is even.

However, none of these conditions influence the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
