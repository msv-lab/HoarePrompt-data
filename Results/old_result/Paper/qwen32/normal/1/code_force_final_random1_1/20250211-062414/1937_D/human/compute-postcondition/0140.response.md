To determine the output state, we need to focus on the given code snippet and how it affects the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
a = A[l - 1]
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `r` is decreased by 1

However, the variable `l` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a` without knowing `l`. However, we can express `a` in terms of `l`.

Given that `A = [0, 1, 3]`, the value of `a` will depend on the value of `l - 1`:
- If `l - 1` is 0, then `a = 0`
- If `l - 1` is 1, then `a = 1`
- If `l - 1` is 2, then `a = 3`

Since `l` is not specified, we can only say that `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`.

Thus, the output state will include the new variable `a` with its value dependent on `l`.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a = A[l - 1]`**.
