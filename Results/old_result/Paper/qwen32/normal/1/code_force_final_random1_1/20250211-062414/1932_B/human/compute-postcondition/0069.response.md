Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list named `results` where each element is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding test case's list.**
