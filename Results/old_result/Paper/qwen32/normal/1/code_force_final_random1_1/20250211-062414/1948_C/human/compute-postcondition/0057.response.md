Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'. It checks if it is possible to pair each '<' in the first string with a '>' in the second string such that each pair is vertically aligned and no two pairs overlap. For each test case, it prints "YES" if such pairing is possible, otherwise it prints "NO".**
