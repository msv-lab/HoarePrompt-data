Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It returns different tuples based on the following conditions: Case_1: If `a` is 0 and `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0). Case_2: If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the tuple (d, c), where `d` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`. Case_3: If `b` is 0 and `a` is not 0, it returns the tuple (1, 1 - (a // b)). Case_4: Otherwise, it returns the tuple (`d`, `c - (a // b) * d`), where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`**.
