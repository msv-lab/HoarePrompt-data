Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are input integers where `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`; `i` is 0; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the same variable values persist as in the precondition.**
