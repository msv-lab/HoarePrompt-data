To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, let's analyze the condition:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 10
- `m` must be at least 15
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is 3 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition, so we ignore it for this task)

First, let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the condition:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting `x = 3` and `y = 1`:
   - `(3 + 1) * 3 <= n`
   - `4 * 3 <= n`
   - `12 <= n`

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting `x = 3` and `y = 1`:
   - `(3 + 1) * 1 <= m`
   - `4 * 1 <= m`
   - `4 <= m`

From these calculations, we see that:
- `n` must be at least 12 to satisfy the first part of the condition.
- `m` must be at least 4 to satisfy the second part of the condition.

However, we were initially given that `n` must be at least 10 and `m` must be at least 15. Since these initial conditions already satisfy our derived conditions (`n` being at least 12 and `m` being at least 4), no further adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged as per the initial conditions.

State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 3**
