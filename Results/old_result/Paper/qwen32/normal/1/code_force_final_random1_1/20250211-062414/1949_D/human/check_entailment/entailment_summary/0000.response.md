### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the initial transition video plan, counting the number of funny ('F') and scary ('S') videos for each scenario, and then filling in the undecided ('?') videos with either 'F' or 'S'. However, the logic used to fill in the undecided videos does not guarantee that the condition of having no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will be met for all permutations of scenarios.

Here are some issues with the current approach:

1. **Counting and Classification**: The program counts the number of funny and scary videos for each scenario and classifies scenarios into two lists (`sa` and `sb`) based on whether they have funny or scary videos but not both. This classification does not provide a balanced way to assign remaining videos.

2. **Assignment Logic**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to undecided videos based on whether the scenario index is within the first \(\lfloor n/4 \rfloor\) elements of `sa` or `sb`. This logic does not consider the overall balance of 'F' and 'S' videos required to meet the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

3. **Symmetry and Consistency**: While the program maintains symmetry (i.e., ensuring that the matrix remains symmetric), it does not ensure that the assignment of 'F' and 'S' to undecided videos will satisfy the problem's main constraint.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using backtracking or dynamic programming to explore possible assignments of 'F' and 'S' to undecided videos while ensuring that the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation does not guarantee that the output will satisfy the problem's main constraint for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
