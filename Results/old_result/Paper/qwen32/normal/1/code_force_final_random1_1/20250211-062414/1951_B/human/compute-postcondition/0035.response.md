Given the initial state, `ind` is a list containing exactly one index of a cow with a higher rating than `x`, and `c` is 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0 and is greater than `k`. The code snippet provided is `return ind[0] - 1`.

Since `ind` contains exactly one index, `ind[0]` refers to that single index. Given that `ind[0]` is greater than `k` and not 0, subtracting 1 from `ind[0]` will yield a value that is still greater than `k-1` and not 0.

Output State: **The program returns the first element of `ind` minus 1, which is a value greater than `k-1` and not 0.**
