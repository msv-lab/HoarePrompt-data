Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string and prints their sum. However, this approach does not necessarily give the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. 

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
mpiep
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The string "mpiep" contains both "map" and "pie" as substrings, but removing just one character ('m' or 'p') can make it beautiful by removing either "map" or "pie".

However, the program would output `2` because it counts both occurrences of "map" and "pie" and sums them up, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of finding the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful.
