Output State: **`custo` is `custo + a_values[y]`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input where the first element is an integer greater than or equal to the integer value of the second element, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, and the current value of `a_values[y]` is less than the current value of `b_values[y]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `custo` has been updated to its previous value plus the value of `a_values[y]`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
