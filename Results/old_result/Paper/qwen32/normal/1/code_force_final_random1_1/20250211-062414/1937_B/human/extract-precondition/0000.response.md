Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The next two lines contain binary strings of length n representing the grid rows a_11 a_12 ... a_1n and a_21 a_22 ... a_2n, where each a_ij is either 0 or 1. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
