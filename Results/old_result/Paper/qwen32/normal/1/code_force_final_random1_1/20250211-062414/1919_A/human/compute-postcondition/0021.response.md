Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case, `result` is undefined as the loop has completed all iterations.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `a`, `b`, `t`, `results`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their states after the last iteration of the loop. The variable `result` is no longer defined because the loop has finished executing.
