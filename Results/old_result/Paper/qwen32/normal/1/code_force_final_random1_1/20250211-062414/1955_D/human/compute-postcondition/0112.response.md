The code snippet provided increments the variable `curr` by 1. Given that `curr` was initially either 0 or 2, after the increment, `curr` will be either 1 or 3.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `b_values` remains a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `curr` is now either 1 or 3.
- `n` and `m` remain the first two integers from the input where `m` is greater than 0.
- `k` remains the third integer from the input.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` remains decreased by 1.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is either 1 or 3; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**
