### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\), and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for those values.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

The core logic in `func_1()` is:
```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at certain points:
- When `n = 100`, `m = 100`, `x = 11`, `y = 10`, `cnt = 27`, the program prints `27`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions and Logic**:
   - The loops are structured to iterate over pairs \((x, y)\) with specific conditions (`x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`). These conditions do not necessarily cover all pairs \((a, b)\) within the specified ranges.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Count**:
   - The count is incremented using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. This formula does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).
   
3. **Handling of GCD Condition**:
   - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` restricts the pairs to coprime numbers, which is too restrictive and does not cover all valid pairs.

4. **Loop Boundaries**:
   - The loops do not cover all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges. For example, the loop `while x * x <= n` limits \(x\) to values whose squares are less than or equal to \(n\), which is insufficient to cover all possible \(a\).

#### Verification Using Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   2 3
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   The only valid pair is \((2, 3)\) because \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(2 + 3 = 5\). The program should output `1`, but it does not.

2. **Test Case:**
   ```
   1
   10 8
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   6
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   Valid pairs are \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), \((8, 8)\). The program should output `6`, but it does not.

Based on the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic and loop conditions are insufficient to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and correctly count the valid ones.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
