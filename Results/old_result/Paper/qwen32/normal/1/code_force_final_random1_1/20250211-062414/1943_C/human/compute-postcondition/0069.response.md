Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Understanding `path_ba`:**
   - `path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`.
   - The length of `path_ba` determines how `ops` is constructed.

2. **Constructing `ops`:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even and greater than 8, `ops` is a list containing ten elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2 - 1, 5), (c2, 5), (c2 - 1, 7), (c2, 7), (c2 - 1, 9), (c2, 9)]`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

3. **Printing `ops`:**
   - The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` into the string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - The `sep='\n'` argument ensures that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

### Case Analysis

#### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd
- Let's assume `path_ba` has an odd length, say `n = 2k + 1`.
- The middle element `c` is at index `k`, i.e., `c = path_ba[k]`.
- `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`.
- After applying the lambda function, the printed output will be:
  ```
  c+1 0
  c+1 1
  c+1 2
  ```

#### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even and Greater than 8
- Let's assume `path_ba` has an even length, say `n = 2k` where `n > 8`.
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, i.e., `c2 = k`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, i.e., `c1 = k - 1`.
- `ops` will be `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (c1, 7), (c2, 7), (c1, 9), (c2, 9)]`.
- After applying the lambda function, the printed output will be:
  ```
  c1+1 1
  c2+1 1
  c1+1 3
  c2+1 3
  c1+1 5
  c2+1 5
  c1+1 7
  c2+1 7
  c1+1 9
  c2+1 9
  ```

### Final Output

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, the problem asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition.

Given the conditions, the output will depend on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even and greater than 8. Therefore, we provide the general form of the output for both cases.

Output: **c+1 0\nc+1 1\nc+1 2 (if the length of path_ba is odd)\nor\nc1+1 1\nc2+1 1\nc1+1 3\nc2+1 3\nc1+1 5\nc2+1 5\nc1+1 7\nc2+1 7\nc1+1 9\nc2+1 9 (if the length of path_ba is even and greater than 8)**
