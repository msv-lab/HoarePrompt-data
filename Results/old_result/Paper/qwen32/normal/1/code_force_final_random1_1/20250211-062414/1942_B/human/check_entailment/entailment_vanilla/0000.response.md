Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` of length `n` from the array `a` of length `n`, where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array.

### Key Points:
1. **Reverse Construction**: The program iterates through the array `a` from the end to the beginning, constructing the permutation `p` in reverse.
2. **Tracking MEX**: It maintains a variable `mex` which represents the current MEX value.
3. **Updating MEX**: After assigning a value to `p[i]`, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned `p[i]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible MEX value for an empty array.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: By iterating from the end of `a` to the beginning, the program ensures that when calculating `p[i]`, all subsequent elements `p[j]` for `j > i` have already been determined.
3. **Calculating `p[i]`**: The value of `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
4. **Updating `mex`**: After setting `p[i]`, the `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

### Verification:
To verify correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example:
```
Input:
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2

Output:
0 1 4 2 3 
0 1 2 3 4 
2 0 1 
```

For the first test case:
- Starting with `mex = 5`, we calculate `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, then update `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
- Next, `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, update `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
- Then, `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, update `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
- Next, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, update `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
- Finally, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, update `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.

This results in `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
