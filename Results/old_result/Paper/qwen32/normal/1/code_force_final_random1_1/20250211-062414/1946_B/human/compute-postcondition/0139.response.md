To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`.
- The list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged.
- `n` is at least 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n` (inclusive).
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- To continue the loop, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`, the list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we need to specify the exact state, let's denote the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration as `i + 1` (assuming `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration):

State: **`sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`, the list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`, the list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`**.

For simplicity, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` becomes `k + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`, the list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we need a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` becomes `4`.

State: **`sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`, the list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 0, `i` is 4**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`, the list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

For a specific example where `i` was `3`:
State: **`sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`, the list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 0, `i` is 4**.
