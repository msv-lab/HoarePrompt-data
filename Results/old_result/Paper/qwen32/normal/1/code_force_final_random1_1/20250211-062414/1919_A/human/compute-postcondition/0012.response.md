The code snippet reassigns the variable `winner` to the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. Since `winner` already held the return value of `func_1(a, b)` from the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `winner`. The variables `a`, `b`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
