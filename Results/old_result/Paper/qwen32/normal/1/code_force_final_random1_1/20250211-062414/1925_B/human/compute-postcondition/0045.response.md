The code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans` will be updated to at least 3. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not provided, we can only say that `ans` will be the maximum of its previous value and 3.

Output State: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 3.**
