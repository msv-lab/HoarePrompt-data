The given code snippet reassigns the value of `m` using the formula `15 * z - y * 4`. Given that `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, we can substitute `z` in the equation for `m`.

The new value of `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `a` is greater than 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
