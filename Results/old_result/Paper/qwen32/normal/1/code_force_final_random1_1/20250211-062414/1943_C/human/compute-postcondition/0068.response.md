Let's analyze the given initial state and Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`path_ba`**: This is a list that starts with `b` (which is likely a vertex identifier), followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, and ends with `-1`. The exact contents of this list are not provided, but we know it has a specific structure.

2. **`ops`**: This list is defined based on the length of `path_ba`:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **odd**, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **even and greater than 8**, `ops` contains ten elements: `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2 - 1, 5), (c2, 5), (c2 - 1, 7), (c2, 7), (c2 - 1, 9), (c2, 9)]`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(len(ops))
```

This line will print the length of the `ops` list.

### Determining the Length of `ops`:
- **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is odd**:
  - `ops` contains 3 tuples: `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`.
  - Therefore, `len(ops)` will be 3.

- **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is even and greater than 8**:
  - `ops` contains 10 elements.
  - Therefore, `len(ops)` will be 10.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we cannot determine definitively whether the length of `ops` will be 3 or 10. However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions given.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the length of `ops` can either be 3 or 10 depending on the length of `path_ba`.

Output: **3 or 10 (depending on the length of `path_ba`)**
