Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be equal to the total number of test cases, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case, `result` is the next element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case, `result` is the next element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
