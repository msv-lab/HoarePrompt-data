The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation, only that it has been decreased by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1.**
