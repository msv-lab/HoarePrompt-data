The code snippet adds the value of `start` (which is 1) to the set `vis`. Since `vis` initially contains only the value 0, after executing the code, `vis` will contain both 0 and 1.

Other variables (`arr`, `nums`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1 and `nums[1]` initially being 2 or more; `start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing the values 0 and 1**.
