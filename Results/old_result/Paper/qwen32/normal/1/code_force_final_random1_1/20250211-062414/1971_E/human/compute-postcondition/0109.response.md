To determine the output of the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the calculations involved in the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but since the original value of `t` is not specified, we'll assume it's part of a larger context not provided here.
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers read from the input.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers read from the input.
- `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with 0.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with 0.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`, starting with 0.
- `l` is set to `q`.
- `m` is calculated as `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated as `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.

### Calculation of `m`:
The value of `m` is dependent on several variables:
- `m` itself (which we assume is initialized to some value, possibly 0, but not explicitly stated).
- `b[s - 1]`: The element in `b` at position `s - 1`.
- `bd[s]`: The element in `bd` at position `s`.
- `ql`: The current value of `ql`.
- `ad[s]`: The element in `ad` at position `s`.

### Calculation of `s`:
`s` is determined by finding the insertion point of `ql` in the sorted list `a`. This means `s` is the smallest index such that `a[s] >= ql`.

### Calculation of `ql`:
`ql` is initially some value and is then decremented by `a[s - 1]`.

### Putting It All Together:
Given the complexity of the calculations and the dependencies among the variables, the exact numerical value of `m` cannot be determined without specific input values for `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and the initial value of `m`.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables:

- `m` is calculated based on the current values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.
- `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from its current value.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space. The exact value of `m` depends on the input values and the intermediate calculations described above.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], s is the index where ql would be inserted into a to maintain sorted order, and ql is updated as ql - a[s - 1])**
