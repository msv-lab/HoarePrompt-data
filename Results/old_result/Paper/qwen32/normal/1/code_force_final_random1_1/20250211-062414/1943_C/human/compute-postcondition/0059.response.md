The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `i` is 1. Since no changes are made to `path_ba`, `c2`, or `c1`, these remain unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now contains two elements: the original `(c2 - 1, 1)` and the newly appended `(c2, 1)`.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 2 and even; `ops` is a list containing two elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1)]`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 1.**
