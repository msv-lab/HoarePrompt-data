The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`). The only variable that changes is `b`, which now holds the new list of integers.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `curr` is the final count of valid matches between the last window of `a` (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) and `b_values`, `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a` with all `cnt_b[i]` set to 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input, and `k` is updated to the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
