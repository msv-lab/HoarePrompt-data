The code updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2` to be `1 + d1[i + 1]`. This means the value at key `i + 2` in `d1` is now one more than the value at key `i + 1`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `d2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is `i + 1`**
