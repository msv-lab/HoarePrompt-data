Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to decode a string `b` that was encoded by replacing each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`.
   - `r` is constructed by taking all distinct characters from `s` and sorting them alphabetically.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - First, identify the unique characters in `b` and sort them alphabetically to form `r`.
   - Then, map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` using the symmetric property in `r`.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string.
   - Inside `func_1`, it creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
   - It then iterates through `b` and tries to replace each character with its symmetric counterpart in `r`. However, the replacement logic is flawed:
     - The code attempts to replace each character in `b` with the corresponding character from the end of `r` but does not correctly map back to the original characters.
     - The code also incorrectly modifies `unique_chars` and `s` within the loop, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Identifying the Flaws:**
   - The main issue is the incorrect implementation of the mapping from `b` back to `s`.
   - The code should create a mapping dictionary from characters in `r` to their symmetric counterparts and use this dictionary to decode `b`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
