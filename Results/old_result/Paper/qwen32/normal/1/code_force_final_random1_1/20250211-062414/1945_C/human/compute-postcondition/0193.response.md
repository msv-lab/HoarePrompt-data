The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least two elements, the loop will execute again for the second element.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the first element in `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should now be the second element in `lst`.

State: **`final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least two elements; `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) != mini`, `final` remains unchanged; `elem` is the second element in `lst`.**
