Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0.**
