The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
