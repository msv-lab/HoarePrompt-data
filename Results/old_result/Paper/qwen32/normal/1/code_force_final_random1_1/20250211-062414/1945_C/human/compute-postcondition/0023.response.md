Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50.**
