Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters, `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged, `distance` is incremented by 1, `rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
