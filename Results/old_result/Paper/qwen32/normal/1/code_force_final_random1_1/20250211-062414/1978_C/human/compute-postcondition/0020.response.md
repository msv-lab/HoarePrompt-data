To determine the output state, we need to focus on the impact of the line `l = func_3(c, l)` on the variables. Here's the breakdown:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `k` remains `k - n + 3`.
- `l` is updated to the result of `func_3(c, l)`.
- `c` remains 2.

Since the function `func_3` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `l`. However, we can state that `l` is now the result of calling `func_3` with `c` (which is 2) and the previous value of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 2.**
