To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only infer that calling `func_1()` will execute whatever operations are defined within it. Given that no details about `func_1()` are provided, we cannot determine how `t` or any other variables might be affected.

Since there's no information on how `func_1()` modifies `t` or introduces new variables, we assume that `t` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within `func_1()`. Without further details, we can only conclude that `t` retains its initial value.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**.
