To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 2.
- `res` is the new input string.
- `i` is set to `n` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise it remains `n`.
- `k` is set to `n` if `res` equals `<`.

However, the variable `k` does not appear in the loop head, so it should not be considered for adjustment.

The loop condition is `for i in range(2, n)`, meaning the loop iterates as long as `i` is in the range from 2 to `n-1`.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios based on the value of `res`:

1. **If `res` is `<`:**
   - `i` would be set to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (which would make `i = n + 1`) and still within the range `[2, n-1]`. This is impossible because `n + 1` cannot be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, if `res` is `<`, the loop would not execute again regardless of the value of `n`.

2. **If `res` is not `<`:**
   - `i` remains `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (which would make `i = n + 1`) and still within the range `[2, n-1]`. This is also impossible because `n + 1` cannot be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, if `res` is not `<`, the loop would not execute again regardless of the value of `n`.

Since neither scenario allows the loop to execute again, the state at the start of the next iteration does not change in a way that would allow the loop to continue.

However, if we strictly follow the instruction to adjust the state based on the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), we can infer that `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration, assuming the loop were to continue.

Given that `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration (regardless of the value of `res`), we increment `i` by 1:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `res` is the new input string, `i` is `n + 1`**
