### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its logic against the problem statement.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
2. If all such strings are present, we should output "YES".
3. If not, we should output "NO" followed by one such string of length `n` that is missing from `s`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Logic to Check Subsequences:**
   - The code uses a bitmask `cur` to keep track of the unique characters encountered in the current sequence.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and updates the bitmask.
   - When the bitmask indicates that all `k` unique characters have been seen (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments the count `cnt` and resets the bitmask.
   
3. **Checking the Count:**
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if `cnt` (the number of complete sequences of `k` unique characters) is at least `n`.
   - If `cnt >= n`, it prints "YES".
   - If `cnt < n`, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a missing string.

4. **Constructing a Missing String:**
   - If `cnt < n`, it tries to find the smallest missing character in the bitmask and constructs a string starting with this character followed by enough 'a's to reach the required length `n`.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
- **Incorrect Approach to Checking Subsequences:**
  - The code incorrectly assumes that finding `cnt` sequences of `k` unique characters means all possible strings of length `n` are present as subsequences. This is not true because the sequences can overlap, and the code does not account for all possible subsequences of length `n`.
  - For example, if `n=2` and `k=2`, the possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The code might incorrectly conclude that "YES" if it finds two sequences of "ab" or "ba", but it does not ensure that all four possible strings are present.

- **Incorrect Construction of Missing String:**
  - The construction of the missing string is flawed. It simply appends the smallest missing character and enough 'a's, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the approach to checking subsequences and constructing the missing string, the provided code is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
