The code snippet `num.append(v)` adds the value `v` to the list `num`. Given the initial state, `num` is either an empty list or a list containing `[v]` depending on the value of `t`.

- If `t` was equal to 3, `num` was initially `[v]`. After appending `v`, `num` becomes `[v, v]`.
- If `t` was not equal to 3, `num` was initially an empty list. After appending `v`, `num` becomes `[v]`.

The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is updated to `v` if `t` is equal to 2 and `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0, `num` is `[v]` if `t` was not equal to 3 or `[v, v]` if `t` was equal to 3, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input**.
