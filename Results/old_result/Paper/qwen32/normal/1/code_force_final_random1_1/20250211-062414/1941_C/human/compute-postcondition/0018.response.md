To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand that the loop processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `a` (which is not used in the loop body) and a string `s`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in `s`, and prints their sum.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and each iteration outputs the count of "map" and "pie" in the respective string `s`, the final output state will simply be the completion of these `t` iterations with no further changes to the variables `t`, `a`, or `s` beyond their usage within each iteration.

Here's the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **After processing all `t` test cases, the program will have printed the sum of occurrences of "map" and "pie" for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, and `s` will not retain any specific value as they are re-assigned in each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations, the program would have printed the desired counts for each test case, and there would be no specific values left for `t`, `a`, or `s` as they are reset in each loop iteration.
