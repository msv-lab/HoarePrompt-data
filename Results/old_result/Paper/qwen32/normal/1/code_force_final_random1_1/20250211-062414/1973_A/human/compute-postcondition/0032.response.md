The given code snippet updates the value of `total_points` by recalculating it using the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are already defined as the elements of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, the new value of `total_points` will be the sum of these three values.

Given that the initial state specifies `total_points` as the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, the reassignment of `total_points` does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same with respect to `total_points`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.**
