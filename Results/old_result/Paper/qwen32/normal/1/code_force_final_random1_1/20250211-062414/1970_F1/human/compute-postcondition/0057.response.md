The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `ind` is 4. Therefore, the tuple `(3, 4)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.

Since `tmp` is determined by the condition `tmp = 0 if line[4][0] == 'B' else 1`, the exact value of `tmp` depends on the first character of `line[4]`. However, regardless of whether `tmp` is 0 or 1, the tuple `(3, 4)` will be added to the corresponding list within `goal`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', and now `goal[tmp]` also includes `(3, 4)`; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3; `ind` is 4; `elements[line[4]]` is (3, 4); `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0] == 'B'` else 1.**
