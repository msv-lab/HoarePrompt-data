The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Bob'` to the console. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `test`, `j`) mentioned in the initial state affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of them.

Therefore, the output of the code is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
