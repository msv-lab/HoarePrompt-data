The variable `c1` is assigned the value of `o * 100 // n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact values of `o` and `n` are not specified, `c1` will take on a value based on these inputs.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. The length of `final` is 0. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) remain unchanged.**
