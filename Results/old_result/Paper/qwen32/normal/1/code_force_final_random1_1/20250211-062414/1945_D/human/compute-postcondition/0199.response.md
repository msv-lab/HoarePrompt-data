The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, which means the loop has already terminated because the range function in Python does not include the stop value (in this case, 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `y` should be set to the starting value of the loop, which is `max_p - 1`.

Given that `max_p` is 2, the loop should start with `y` being `2 - 1 = 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`custo` is 145 if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` and `y == 1`; otherwise, `custo` is 110. `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 1**
