To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n_cases` is greater than 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition and does not need adjustment)
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`
- `power` is 2
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not part of the loop condition and does not need adjustment)

The loop condition is `while power < n:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `power` is 2.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`.

Since `t` is between 3 and 10^4, let's calculate the range for `n`:
- The smallest possible value for `t` is 3. The base-2 logarithm of 3 is approximately 1.585.
- The largest possible value for `t` is 10^4. The base-2 logarithm of 10^4 is approximately 13.287.

Therefore, `n` is between approximately 1.585 and 13.287.

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` (which is currently 2) must be less than `n`. Since `n` can be as low as approximately 1.585, the current value of `power` (which is 2) is already greater than the minimum possible value of `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to decrease `power` to a value less than `n`.

Since `n` can be as low as approximately 1.585, we should set `power` to a value slightly less than this, such as 1.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
