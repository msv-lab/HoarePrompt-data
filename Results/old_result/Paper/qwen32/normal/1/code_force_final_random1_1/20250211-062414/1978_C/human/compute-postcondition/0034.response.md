To determine the output state, let's break down the given information:

- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5.
- `k` is defined as `k - 2*i + 2` and is not equal to 0.
- `l` is a list starting with 1, followed by `n`, and then containing integers from 2 to `n-2` with `n-1` inserted at the `-k` position.
- `x` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `i`.

Given the definition of `l`, let's construct the list:
1. The list starts with `[1, n]`.
2. It then includes integers from 2 to `n-2`.
3. Finally, `n-1` is inserted at the `-k` position.

Since `k` is defined as `k - 2*i + 2` and we don't have specific values for `k` and `i`, we'll keep it in its symbolic form for now. However, we know that `k` is not zero, and it affects the position where `n-1` is inserted into the list.

The list `l` will look like this:
\[ [1, n, 2, 3, \ldots, n-2, n-1] \]
with `n-1` moved to the `-k` position.

Given that the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can't pinpoint the exact position of `n-1`. However, we know its general structure.

Output State: **The program returns a list `l` starting with 1, followed by `n`, then integers from 2 to `n-2`, and finally `n-1` inserted at the `-k` position, where `k` is defined as `k - 2*i + 2` and is not equal to 0.**
