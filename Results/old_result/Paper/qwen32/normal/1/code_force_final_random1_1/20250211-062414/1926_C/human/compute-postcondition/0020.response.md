To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `pd` list and the variable `i`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, it converts the current value of `i` to a string, then for each character (digit) in this string, it adds the integer value of that digit to `pd[i]`.

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `N` is 200001.
   - `pd` is a list of size `N` initialized such that the first `t` elements are cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`.
   - `i` starts at 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, the loop processes each digit of `i` and adds it to `pd[i]`.

The final state of `pd` will reflect the cumulative sum of the digits of each index `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output State Description:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.
- The variable `N` remains unchanged as it is a constant.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1` after the loop completes because the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- The `pd` list will be updated such that `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `pd[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and `i` will be `n + 1`.
