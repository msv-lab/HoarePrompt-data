Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n-2` elements are `0`, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`; `stop` is `True` if at least one element in the first `n-2` elements was negative, otherwise `stop` remains `False`. Additionally, either both the last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` are `0`, or at least one of them is not `0`.**
