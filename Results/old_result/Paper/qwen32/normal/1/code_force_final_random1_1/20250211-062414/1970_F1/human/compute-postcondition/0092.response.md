Postcondition: **`line` must have at least one element. If the element at index `ind` is not '..', then `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(i, ind)`. `ind` is `ind + 1`.**
