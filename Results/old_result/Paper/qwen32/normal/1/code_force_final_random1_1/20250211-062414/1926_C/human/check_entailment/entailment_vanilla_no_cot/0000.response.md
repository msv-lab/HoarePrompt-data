Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is defined after it is used, which will cause a `NameError` when the program runs.
2. The precomputation of sums for all values up to 200,000 is unnecessary and inefficient. It also incorrectly assumes that the maximum value of `n` is always 200,000, which could lead to incorrect results if `n` is less than 200,000 in any test case.
3. The program calculates the cumulative sum of digit sums up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. However, the problem requires the sum of digit sums up to `n` for each test case, not the cumulative sum up to 200,000.
4. The program does not handle the input and output correctly for multiple test cases. It should read the number of test cases and then process each test case individually.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = num // 10
    return a

def main():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum_of_digits(i)
        print(total_sum)

main()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, calculating the sum of the digit sums for each `n` from 1 to `n`. This ensures that the program works correctly for any valid input within the constraints.
