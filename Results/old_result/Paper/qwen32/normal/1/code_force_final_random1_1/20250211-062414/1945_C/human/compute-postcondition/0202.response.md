The code snippet assigns a new value to `c1` based on the expression `o * 100 // n`. The values of `o` and `n` are not specified, so we can only express `c1` in terms of these variables. The other variables, including `final`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. The length of `final` is 0. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
