The loop head in this case is `_ in range(int(input()))`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times determined by `int(input())`. Since the loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, or `best`, only the iteration count controlled by `input()` can be adjusted.

However, since the loop head does not contain `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, or `best`, these variables should remain unchanged. The only thing that changes is the implicit iteration count controlled by the input.

Given that the loop iterates based on the value provided by `input()`, and assuming that the input value hasn't changed, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `best` should remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 1 if no such index exists, `i` is `n`, and `best` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such index exists**.
