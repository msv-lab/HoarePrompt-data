The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the `resultats` list. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, `resultats` already contains some elements based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. The new element added to `resultats` is specifically `egalites // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must contain at least two tuples, `total_points` is the sum of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list that has been populated based on the conditions involving `egalites`, `total_matchs`, and the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` and now includes an additional element `egalites // 2`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the values of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` includes an additional element `-1`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, `resultats` includes an additional element `-1`.**
