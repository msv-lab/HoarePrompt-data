Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 500), and `cas_de_test`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) representing the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order for each test case (where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). The function returns a list `resultats` containing the results of each test case based on specified conditions.**
