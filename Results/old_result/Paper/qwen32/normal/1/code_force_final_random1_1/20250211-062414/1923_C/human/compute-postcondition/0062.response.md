The code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given that `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` is 0, the new state of `c` will be `[0, j]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is `x`, `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1; otherwise, `j` is 0.**
