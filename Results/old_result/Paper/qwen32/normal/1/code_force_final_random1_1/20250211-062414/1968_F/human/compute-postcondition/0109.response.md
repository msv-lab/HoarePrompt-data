Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 5`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 5`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
