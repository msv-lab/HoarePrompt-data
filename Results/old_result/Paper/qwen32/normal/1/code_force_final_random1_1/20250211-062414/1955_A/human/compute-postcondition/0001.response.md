The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial state does not specify any values for `A`, `B`, or `C`, so these values are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30; `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input.**
