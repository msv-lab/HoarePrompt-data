Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then wants to form a different rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other.

### Key Observations
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to form a different rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles will also have odd dimensions, and no combination of these smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle with integer sides.

### Provided Program Analysis
Here is the provided program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`**
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and logically flawed. It attempts to compare something that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
   
2. **Condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`**
   - This condition will always be true for any pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) that are not equal, because the difference between two different integers is never zero. Therefore, this condition does not correctly reflect the logic needed to solve the problem.

3. **Missing Correct Logic**
   - The correct logic should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, then the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, then it is impossible to form a new rectangle.

### Correct Logic
- If \(a \% 2 == 0\) or \(b \% 2 == 0\), print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Correct Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues in the code and suggesting a correct approach.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
