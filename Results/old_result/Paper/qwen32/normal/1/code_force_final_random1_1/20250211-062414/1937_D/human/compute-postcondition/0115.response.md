Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`. If `r` was initially 0, then `r` remains 0 and `l` is not greater than `r`. Otherwise, `r` remains 2, `a = 3`, `l` is not greater than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, and `b = (i - 3) * 3`.**
