Output State: **`final` is an empty list, `n` remains the same, `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`, `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` remains the list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `final` is now an empty list. All other variables retain their original values.
