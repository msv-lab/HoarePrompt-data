Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: `i` is `3`, `n` is greater than `4`
Code Snippet: `d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`

From the code snippet, we know that `d1[i + 2]` is being updated. Since `i` is `3`, `d1[5]` will be updated. The new value of `d1[5]` is calculated as `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.

The values of `l[4]`, `l[3]`, and `d1[4]` are not specified, so we'll represent the new value of `d1[5]` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `3`, `n` is greater than `4`, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`**.
