The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `num`. Since the loop iterates over `num`, the state of `i` will be the next element in `num` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered.
- `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered.
- `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element.
- If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains 0. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 and `i` is an integer such that `start <= i <= end`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the last element processed from the list `num`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should take the value of the next element in `num` (if it exists).

Since `num` contains at least one element, and assuming the loop has just finished processing an element, the next state should reflect the next element in `num` being assigned to `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.
