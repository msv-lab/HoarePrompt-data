The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` subtracts the value of `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`. Given that `opNum` is 0, the value of `a[i + 2]` does not change.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` remains the same; `a[i]` is 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0.**
