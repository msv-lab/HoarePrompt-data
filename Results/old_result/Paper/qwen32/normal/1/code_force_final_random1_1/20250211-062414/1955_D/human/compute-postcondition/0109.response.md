Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1 (making `curr` 2 if it was initially 1) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 2; otherwise, `curr` remains 0; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
