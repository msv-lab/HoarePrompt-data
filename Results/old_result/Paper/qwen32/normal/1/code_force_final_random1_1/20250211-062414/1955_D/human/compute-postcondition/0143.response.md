Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was initially non-negative, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` or `curr`. `ans` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is incremented by 1.**
