The given code snippet modifies the variable `pow` by multiplying it by 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `tot`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is `tot` + `a`. If `tot` (before increment) is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` (before increment) + `a`, then `tot` (after increment) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the conditions on `tot` and `k` remain unspecified.**
