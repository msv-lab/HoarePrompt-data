The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n_cases`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is adjusted based on its original value (if the original value of `n` is 1, then `n` remains 1; otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`).
- `power` is either equal to `n` if it was already equal to `n`, or `power` is decremented by 1.

Since the loop iterates over `i` in the range of `n_cases`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to move to the next iteration. The value of `n_cases` does not change within the loop, as it determines the total number of iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n_cases` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is adjusted based on its original value, `power` is either equal to `n` or decremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
