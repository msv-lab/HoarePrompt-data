### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Reads \(n\) and \(m\), then counts the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\).
2. `func_2()`: Reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
- The state after processing a specific test case with \(n = 100\) and \(m = 100\) shows `cnt = 27`, but this does not align with the expected output for this test case.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions and Logic**:
   - The program uses nested loops with conditions `while x * x <= n` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.
   - These conditions do not ensure that all pairs \((a, b)\) within the ranges \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) are checked.
   - The inner loop increments `y` and the outer loop increments `x`, but the conditions do not guarantee that all combinations are considered.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Count**:
   - The count is calculated using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - This formula does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

3. **Handling of GCD Condition**:
   - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` checks only for coprime pairs \((x, y)\).
   - This is insufficient because the problem requires checking all pairs, not just coprime ones.

4. **Loop Boundaries**:
   - The loop boundaries and the way `x` and `y` are incremented do not ensure that all pairs \((a, b)\) are checked.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotation shows a state after processing a test case with \(n = 100\) and \(m = 100\), where `cnt = 27`.
- However, this does not match the expected output for this test case, indicating that the program does not correctly count the valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The loop conditions, logic, and calculation of the count are flawed, and the program does not check all necessary pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
