To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

```
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` is either an empty list, a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, or a list with three elements `[a_0, x, 0]` if `idx_A` was empty, or `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1]` if `idx_A` was not empty.
- `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'.
- `i` is [previous value of i] + 1.

The code modifies the value of `x` based on the length of `A` and `idx_A`. Let's consider the different cases for `A` and `idx_A`:

### Case 1: `A` is an empty list
This case is not possible because the code references `A[len(A) - 1]`, which would raise an `IndexError` if `A` were empty.

### Case 2: `A` has two elements `[a_0, x]`
- `A[len(A) - 1]` is `x`.
- `idx_A` must have one element since `A` has two elements and `idx_A` is updated only when encountering a '>' in `s`.
- `len(idx_A)` is 1.
- The new value of `x` is `x + (i - idx_A[0]) * 1`.

### Case 3: `A` has three elements `[a_0, x, 0]` if `idx_A` was empty, or `[a_0, x, x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1]` if `idx_A` was not empty
- `A[len(A) - 1]` is the last element of `A`.
- If `idx_A` was empty, the last element of `A` is `0`.
- If `idx_A` was not empty, the last element of `A` is `x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1`.
- `len(idx_A)` is at least 2.
- The new value of `x` is calculated based on the last element of `A` and the current value of `i`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `x` is recalculated based on the last element of `A` and the current value of `i`.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `i`) remain unchanged except for `x`.

### Final Output State:
- `s` remains a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `A` remains the same list with its last element updated to the new value of `x`.
- `idx_A` remains the same list.
- `i` remains [previous value of i] + 1.
- `x` is updated to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is updated with its last element as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`; `idx_A` remains the same list; `i` is [previous value of i] + 1; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.**
