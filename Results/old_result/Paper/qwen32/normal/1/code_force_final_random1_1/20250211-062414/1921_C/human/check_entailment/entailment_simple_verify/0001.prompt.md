You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `test_cases` number of times. For each test case, the program reads two lines of input: the first line contains integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the length of the array `arr` to follow, `f` is a threshold value, `a` and `b` are coefficients used in calculations. The second line contains `n` integers representing the array `arr`. The program calculates a list `array2` by iterating through `arr` and appending `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. It then checks if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`. If it is, the program prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all `test_cases`, the program terminates.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Stepan can send `n` messages at specific times (`m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`) using a phone with initial charge `f`.
   - The phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time and `b` units of charge whenever it is turned off and then on.
   - If the charge drops to zero or below at any point, Stepan cannot send a message.

2. **Approach Required:**
   - For each test case, we need to simulate the process of sending messages and turning the phone on and off to see if it's possible to send all messages without the charge dropping to zero or below.
   - We should consider the cost of turning the phone on and off versus the cost of keeping it on during intervals between messages.

3. **Analysis of the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times.
   - It then calculates the time differences between consecutive messages and checks if the difference is less than `b / a`. If so, it adds the charge consumed during that interval to `array2`.
   - Finally, it sums up the charges in `array2` and adds `b` for each interval where the phone was turned off and on. It compares this total to `f` to decide if it's possible to send all messages.

4. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The logic for determining when to turn the phone on and off is flawed. The program only considers intervals shorter than `b / a` and does not correctly account for all scenarios.
   - The program does not handle the scenario where the phone might need to be turned off and on multiple times within a longer interval.
   - The program does not correctly simulate the charge level throughout the process, which is crucial for ensuring the phone doesn't run out of charge.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. It fails to accurately simulate the charge level and the decision-making process for turning the phone on and off.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
