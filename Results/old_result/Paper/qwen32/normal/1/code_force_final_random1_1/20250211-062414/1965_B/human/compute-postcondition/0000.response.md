In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed. The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer indicating the number of test cases.

Since we cannot modify the behavior of `func_10()` directly, we can only consider the implication of its return value. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `func_10()` should return a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
