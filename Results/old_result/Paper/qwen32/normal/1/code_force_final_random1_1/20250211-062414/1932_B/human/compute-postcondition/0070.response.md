Functionality: **The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in each test case's list and returns a list of these LCMs.**
