### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program to see if it correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`a * 2`) is less than the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`), then the optimal strategy is to buy each yogurt individually. Thus, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - If the number of yogurts `n` is even, the best strategy is to take advantage of the promotion as much as possible. Therefore, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If the number of yogurts `n` is odd, the best strategy is to buy `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and buy the remaining yogurt at the individual price. Thus, the total cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

However, the program does not correctly implement the first condition. It should always check whether buying pairs using the promotion is cheaper than buying individually, regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. Here's the corrected logic:
- Calculate the number of pairs `X = n // 2`.
- Calculate the number of individual yogurts `Y = n % 2`.
- The total cost is `X * b + Y * a`.

This ensures that we always use the promotion whenever it is cheaper than buying individually.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        X = n // 2
        Y = n % 2
        print(X * b + Y * a)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not handle all cases correctly due to the incorrect implementation of the condition checking for the promotion price versus individual price. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
