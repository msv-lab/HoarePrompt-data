The code appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` contains `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0 and now also contains `'YES'`, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Additionally, `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`.**
