Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing one element, which is `0`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; if `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, suf[i] + l[i]]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; if `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, suf[i] + l[i], suf[i] + l[i] + l[i+1]]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; if `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, suf[i] + l[i], suf[i] + l[i] + l[i+1], suf[i] + l[i]]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; if `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
