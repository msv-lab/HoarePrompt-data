To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be greater than 1 to include at least one value (specifically, `1`).

Let's analyze the provided state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
- `tc` must be at least 2: This variable is also not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`: This variable is part of the loop head. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`: This variable is not directly part of the loop head but affects the value of `n`.
- `dp` is `True`: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
- `i` is `n-1`: This variable is initialized outside the loop but is the loop variable. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts does not affect whether the loop will execute, as the loop sets `i` to `1` on its first iteration.

From this analysis, the only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop executes.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is `True`, `i` is `n-1`**
