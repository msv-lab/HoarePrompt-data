The function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters. If `space` is True, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if `space` is False, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, each substring or character is converted to an integer. The function returns a list of these processed items, either as integers or strings.
