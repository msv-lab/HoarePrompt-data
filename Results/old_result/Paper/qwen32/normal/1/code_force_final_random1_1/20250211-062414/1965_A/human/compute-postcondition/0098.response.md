Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements.
- `j` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `j` do not affect this particular print statement because it directly prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Bob'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
