The code snippet `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. This operation affects only the variable `set_`, while the other variables (`arr`, `A`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `set_` is a list of unique integers derived from `arr`. After sorting, `set_` will contain the same unique integers but in sorted order.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines for each test case: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr`.**
