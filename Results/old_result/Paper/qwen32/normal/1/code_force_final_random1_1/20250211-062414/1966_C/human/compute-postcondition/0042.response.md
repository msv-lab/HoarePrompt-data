Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`; `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`; `i` is `n-1`; `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `tc` has been decreased by 1 while all other variables remain unchanged.
