The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given that `score` was initially 0, its new value will be the value of `l[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is `l[i]`**.
