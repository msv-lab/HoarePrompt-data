The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the user input. This means the original value of `n` (which was an integer between 2 and 100) is replaced by the new input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
