### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`. Specifically, the solution fails for `n = 24` and `n = 55` as demonstrated in the assessment.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the solution is incorrect:

1. **For `n = 24`:**
   - The provided solution constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which results in `'aa' + 'r'` or `'aar'`.
   - The correct lexicographically smallest word is `'aav'` because `'aav'` comes before `'aar'` lexicographically.

2. **For `n = 55`:**
   - The provided solution constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z'` which results in `'a' + 'p' + 'z'` or `'apz'`.
   - The correct lexicographically smallest word is `'czz'` because `'czz'` comes before `'apz'` lexicographically.

These examples clearly show that the provided solution does not always produce the correct result. The logic used in the solution is flawed because it does not consider all possible combinations of letters that could sum up to `n` while ensuring the word is lexicographically smallest.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
