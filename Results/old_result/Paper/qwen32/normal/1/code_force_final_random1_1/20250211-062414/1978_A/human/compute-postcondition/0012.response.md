Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable indicates the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input.
- `_` is the current iteration count incremented by 1. This variable is typically used in loops to keep track of iterations but is not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Explanation:
1. **`nums[:-1]`**: This slice notation represents all elements of the list `nums` except the last one.
2. **`max(nums[:-1])`**: This function call finds the maximum value among all elements in the list `nums` except the last one.
3. **`nums[-1]`**: This index notation refers to the last element of the list `nums`.
4. **`max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`**: This expression adds the maximum value from all elements except the last one to the last element itself.

### Output:
The code will print the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements of the list `nums` and the last element of the list `nums`.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements of the list `nums` and the last element of the list `nums`**.
