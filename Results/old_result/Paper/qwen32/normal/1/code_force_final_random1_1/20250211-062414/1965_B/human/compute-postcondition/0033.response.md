To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(lk, l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is the current index in the range from `lk` to `l`.
- `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
- `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.

Since the loop iterates over `i` starting from `lk` up to (but not including) `l`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- Increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.
- `lk` and `l` remain unchanged as they define the range of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `3 ≤ k ≤ n`; `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of `b` and `l > lk`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of `bk` and `lk` must be at least 2; `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, k - 1 - sum([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144]), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2, 2`; `i` is incremented by 1**
