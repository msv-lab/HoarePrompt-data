Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.** 

However, there seems to be a logical inconsistency in the provided if condition and the context. Since `power` is explicitly defined as being equal to `n`, the condition `(power == n)` would always be true, making the else block unreachable under the current setup. If we assume the intention was to check something else, please clarify. Otherwise, based on the given information, the else block would never be entered. 

If we proceed with the assumption that there might be a different intended condition, let's consider a more general approach where `power` could potentially not equal `n` due to some other logic not shown here:

Revised Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is not necessarily equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition `(power == n)` is false.**

Given the current setup, the revised postcondition reflects a scenario where `power` might differ from `n` for reasons outside the provided snippet.
