The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` could have one of three values before this operation:

1. `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.
2. 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`.
3. 'S' otherwise.

After appending 'F', the new value of `nx` will be:

1. `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.
2. 'FF' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`.
3. 'SF' otherwise.

The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `xx`, and `sa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'FF' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'SF'. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n`. `j` is `j + 1`.**
