The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Since `i` is defined as `i + 2` in the initial state, it means that `i` has already been incremented by 2 before the append operation. Therefore, the value of `i` used in the append operation is `i + 2`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `i` is `i + 2`; `sa` has had `i + 2` appended to it.**
