Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` remains unchanged, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` is `i + 2` and remains unchanged from its previous state. The value of `x` is not altered. The value of `t1` is calculated as `(a[i] + 1) % n`, and `t2` is newly calculated as `(a[i] + 2) % n`. All other conditions and values remain the same as per the initial state.
