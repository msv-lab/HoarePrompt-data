The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `r` was initially set to `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `r` was `n - 2`. After executing `r -= 1`, `r` will now be `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'L', and `r` will be `n - 3` if `s[0]` is 'R'.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing two elements, initially `a[0]` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `a[n-1]` if `s[0]` is 'R', and now also `a[n-1]` if `s[1]` is 'L' or `a[n-2]` if `s[1]` is 'R'; `l` is 1 if `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`; `i` is 1.**
