Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.**
