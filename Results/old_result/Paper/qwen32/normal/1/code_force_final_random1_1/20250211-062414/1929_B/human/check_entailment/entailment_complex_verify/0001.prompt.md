You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        if 4 * n - 2 == k:

        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each pair `(n, k)`, it has printed either `k // 2 + 1` if `k == 4 * n - 2`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The loop counter `_` is now equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a computed value: `k // 2 + 1` if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, otherwise it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of `4n - 2` diagonals, consisting of `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Coloring Requirement**: To cover `k` diagonals with the minimum number of colored cells, we need to strategically place the colored cells. 
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2n - 1`, we can cover `k` diagonals by placing one colored cell per diagonal along either the top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left diagonals.
   - If `k` is greater than `2n - 1`, we need to cover both sets of diagonals. For example, if `k = 4n - 2`, we need to cover all diagonals, which means we need to color at least one cell in each diagonal.

2. **Special Case**: When `k = 4n - 2`, we need to cover all diagonals. The optimal way to do this is to color cells such that each diagonal gets at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring cells in a pattern that ensures every diagonal is covered. One such pattern is to color cells in a "staircase" manner, which requires `n` cells from one set of diagonals and `n-1` cells from the other set, totaling `2n - 1` cells. However, due to overlaps, the exact minimum number of cells required is `n + (n-1) - 1 = 2n - 2` cells. But since the formula provided in the code gives `k // 2 + 1` which is `2n - 1` for `k = 4n - 2`, it seems to be an off-by-one error or a specific pattern assumption.

3. **General Case**: For `k < 4n - 2`, the formula `ceil(k / 2)` seems to work because it ensures that we are covering the minimum number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one from each set).

### Code Analysis

The provided code uses the following logic:
- If `k = 4n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

Let's verify this logic against our observations:
- For `k = 4n - 2`, the formula `k // 2 + 1` simplifies to `2n - 1`. This seems correct based on our analysis, but it might be an off-by-one error or a specific pattern assumption.
- For `k < 4n - 2`, the formula `ceil(k / 2)` correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover `k` diagonals.

### Conclusion

The provided code seems to handle the general case correctly but might have an issue with the special case `k = 4n - 2`. However, given the examples and the problem constraints, it appears to produce the correct results.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **True**
