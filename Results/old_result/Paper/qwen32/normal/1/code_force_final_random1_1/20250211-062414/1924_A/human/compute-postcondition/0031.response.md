The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the current character `ss` to the variable `ans`. This means that `ans` now includes the character `ss` at its end. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` includes the character `ss` appended to it.**
