Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be equal to the total number of test cases, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last test case. The variable `t` will reflect the total number of test cases processed. The `results` list will contain the outcome (winner) for each of the `t` test cases, and `winner` will store the result of the last test case.
