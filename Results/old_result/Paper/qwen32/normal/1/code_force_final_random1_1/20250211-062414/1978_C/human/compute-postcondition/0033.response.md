To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and its effect on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is `k - 2*i + 2` and `k` is not equal to 0
- `l` is a list starting with 1, then `n`, and then containing integers from 2 to `n-2`
- `x` is `n-1`
- `i` is `i`

Code Snippet:
```python
l.insert(-k, x)
```

This line of code inserts the value of `x` into the list `l` at the position `-k`. In Python, negative indices count from the end of the list, so `-k` means `k` positions from the end.

Let's break down the changes:
- `x` is `n-1`, so the value being inserted is `n-1`.
- The list `l` initially contains `[1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]`.
- The insertion point is `-k`, which means `k` positions from the end of the list.

Given the constraints and the nature of the list, the exact position of the insertion depends on the value of `k`. However, the key points are:
- `k` is derived from `k - 2*i + 2` and is not zero.
- The list `l` starts with 1, ends with `n-2`, and has `n-2` elements in total.

After the insertion, the list `l` will have `n-1` inserted at the `-k` position. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is `k - 2*i + 2` and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list starting with 1, then `n`, and then containing integers from 2 to `n-2` with `n-1` inserted at the `-k` position; `x` is `n-1`; `i` is `i`.**
