The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `lst`, or `rev`. The only new variables introduced are `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
