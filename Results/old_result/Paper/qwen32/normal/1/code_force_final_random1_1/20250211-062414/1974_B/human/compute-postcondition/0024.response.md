Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings with at least one more character to process, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the original strings of `s`, `char` is the next character in the list `s`. If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**
