Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Each of the next `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `m` ≤ 10^18.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input. The constraints on `t` remain the same. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
