Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Queue is not empty (except it has one less element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start, current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, neighbor is undefined. If current equals target, the program returns the distance associated with the current node, which is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Queue is not empty (possibly with one more element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start (including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in the visited set initially), current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. If `neighbor` was not in the visited set, it is now added to the visited set and the queue is updated with one more element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Queue is not empty (possibly with more elements), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start (including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in the visited set initially), current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in the visited set, the queue now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Queue is not empty (possibly with more elements). `visited` set contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not in the `visited` set initially. `current` is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, `dist` is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, `tree[current]` has at least one element, and `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set, the queue now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
