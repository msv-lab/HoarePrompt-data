Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`; `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`; either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the addition of the fact that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
