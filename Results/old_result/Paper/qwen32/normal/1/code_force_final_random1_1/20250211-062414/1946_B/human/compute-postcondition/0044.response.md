The given code modifies the variable `sm` using the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`. This simplifies to `sm = (2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

Let's break down the changes:

1. `sm` is recalculated using the formula `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.
2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `l`, `suf`, `smin`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.**
