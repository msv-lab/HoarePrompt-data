The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` non-overlapping sequences of `k` unique characters. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string by appending the smallest missing character and enough 'a's to reach `n` sequences, then prints this constructed string.
