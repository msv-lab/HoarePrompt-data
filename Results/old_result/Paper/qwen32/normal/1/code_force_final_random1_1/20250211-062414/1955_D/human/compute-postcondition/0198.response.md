Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is the total number of elements in `a` that are in `b` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` after decrementing, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; `cnt_b` reflects the decrements for elements found in `a`; `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
