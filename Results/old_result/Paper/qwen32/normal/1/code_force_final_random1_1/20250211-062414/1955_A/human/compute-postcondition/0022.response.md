To determine what will be printed by the `print(A * B)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the values of `A`, `B`, or `C` directly.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input. Since no specific values are provided for these integers, we must refer to them as they are described.

Given this information, the expression `A * B` represents the product of the integers `A` and `B`.

Thus, the `print(A * B)` statement will output the product of the integers `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers obtained from the input)**
