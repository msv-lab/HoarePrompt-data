The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` retains its previous value, and `n` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing one more element (the input string), `i` is incremented by 1, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1**
