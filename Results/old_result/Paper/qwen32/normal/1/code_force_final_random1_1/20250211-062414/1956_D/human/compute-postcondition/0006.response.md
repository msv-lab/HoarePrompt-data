The only objects in the loop head are the variables `l` and `r`, which are derived from the tuples in the `ops` list. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `l` and `r` to reflect the next tuple in the `ops` list.

Given that `ops` must contain at least one tuple, we assume that there are more tuples available in `ops` for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, we need to update `l` and `r` to the values of the next tuple in `ops`.

Let's denote the current tuple being processed as `(l_current, r_current)`. After this iteration, the next tuple `(l_next, r_next)` should be assigned to `l` and `r` respectively.

Since we don't have the specific values of the tuples, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `l` and `r` are set to the values of the next tuple in `ops`**

However, to be more precise, if we assume that the current tuple is the first one, then the next tuple would be the second one in the list. Let's denote the next tuple as `(l_next, r_next)`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `l` is `l_next` (the first element of the second tuple in `ops`), `r` is `r_next` (the second element of the second tuple in `ops`)**

Without the specific values of the tuples, this is the most accurate representation of the state at the start of the next iteration.
