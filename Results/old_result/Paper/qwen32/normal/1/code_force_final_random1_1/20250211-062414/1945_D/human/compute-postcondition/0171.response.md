To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over `y` starting from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`, decrementing `y` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was some value, and since the loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break it down:

- `y` at the start of the next iteration should be `y - 1`.
- `num_fila` and `max_p` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration, `y` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `k - 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `y` should be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`custo` is updated to either `custo + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`. `num_fila` remains an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` remains unchanged, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` and `b_values` remain lists containing the integer values of all elements in `a` and `b` respectively, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input where the first element is an integer greater than or equal to the integer value of the second element, `a` remains a list of substrings from the latest input, and `b` remains a list of substrings from the input, `y` is decremented by 1.**

To make it clear and specific to the loop head variables:

State: **`y` is decremented by 1, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged.**
