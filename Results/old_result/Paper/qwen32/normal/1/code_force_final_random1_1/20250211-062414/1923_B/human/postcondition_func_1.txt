The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of monsters, their health values, their positions, and the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters under the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.
