You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to simulate a process where Vladislav lays down cards according to specific rules:
1. Lay down all odd-numbered cards in ascending order.
2. Then, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number in ascending order.
3. Continue this pattern with multiples of 3, 4, etc., until all cards are laid down.

We need to find the k-th card laid down in this sequence.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each defined by `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card we need to find).

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Calculate the Number of Cards in Each Group:**
   - The list `L` is used to store the number of cards in each group.
   - The loop `while n:` calculates how many cards fall into each group of multiples of odd numbers.
     - `m = (n + 1) // 2`: This calculates the number of odd numbers up to `n`.
     - `n -= m`: Subtract the count of odd numbers from `n` to proceed to the next group.
     - `L.append(m)`: Append the count of odd numbers to the list `L`.

2. **Determine the k-th Card:**
   - Initialize `tot` (total cards processed so far) and `pow` (current multiplier).
   - Iterate through the list `L` to find the group that contains the k-th card.
     - If `tot < k <= tot + a`, it means the k-th card is in the current group.
     - Calculate the card number using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and print it.
     - Update `tot` and `pow` for the next iteration.

### Verification Against the Example
Let's verify the program with the first few test cases from the example:

1. **Test Case 1: n = 7, k = 1**
   - Odd numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7]
   - First card is 1.
   - The program correctly outputs 1.

2. **Test Case 2: n = 7, k = 2**
   - Second card is 3.
   - The program correctly outputs 3.

3. **Test Case 3: n = 7, k = 3**
   - Third card is 5.
   - The program correctly outputs 5.

4. **Test Case 4: n = 7, k = 4**
   - Fourth card is 7.
   - The program correctly outputs 7.

5. **Test Case 5: n = 7, k = 5**
   - Fifth card is 2.
   - The program correctly outputs 2.

6. **Test Case 6: n = 7, k = 6**
   - Sixth card is 6.
   - The program correctly outputs 6.

7. **Test Case 7: n = 7, k = 7**
   - Seventh card is 4.
   - The program correctly outputs 4.

The program correctly handles these test cases, suggesting it is likely correct.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and verification against the example test cases, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
