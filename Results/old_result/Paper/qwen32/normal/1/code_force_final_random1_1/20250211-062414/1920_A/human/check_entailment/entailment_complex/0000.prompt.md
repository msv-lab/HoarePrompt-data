Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value, where if it is False, the function reads an integer from the input; if it is True, the function returns the integer 1.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer read from the input.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it reads an integer from the input and returns it. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether the input line should be split into items based on spaces, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `space` and `to_int` are booleans, `line` is the input string. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces. If `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers derived from `items`, where `items` is a list of substrings split by spaces if `space` is True, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is False. Each element in `items` is converted to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings from `line` split by spaces if `space` is True, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is False. Since `to_int` is False, no conversion to integers occurs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input and processes it based on two boolean parameters. If `space` is True, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if `space` is False, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, each substring or character is converted to an integer. The function returns a list of these processed items, either as integers or strings.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and sym is a string.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''

    #State: `string` is the concatenation of all elements of `arr` (each converted to a string) with `sym` inserted between each element, and no trailing `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string which is the concatenation of all elements of `arr` (each converted to a string) with `sym` inserted between each element, and no trailing `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of elements (`arr`) and a string (`sym`), and returns a single string where each element of the list is converted to a string and concatenated together with `sym` inserted between each element, without a trailing `sym`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string value, and substring is a string value.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:

    #State: `string` is a string value, `substring` is a string value, `indices` is a list containing all starting indices of `substring` in `string`, `index` is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list named `indices` which contains all starting indices of `substring` in `string`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two string inputs, `string` and `substring`, and returns a list of all starting indices where `substring` appears in `string`. If `substring` does not appear in `string`, the returned list will be empty.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values, and element is a value of any type that may or may not be present in arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices from `arr` where the value matches `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` and a value `element` as inputs and returns a list of indices where `element` is found in `arr`. If `element` is not present in `arr`, it returns an empty list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists (2D list), index is a non-negative integer representing the column index to check within each sub-array, and value is a value that is being searched for in the specified column of each sub-array.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: None.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function searches through a 2D list `arr` for a sub-array where the element at the specified column index `index` matches the given `value`. If such a sub-array is found, it returns that sub-array; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is an integer initialized to -1, end is a float initialized to 1000000000.0, num is a list that will store integers, t is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3 representing the type of constraint, and v is an integer representing the value of the constraint.

Additionally, `start` is less than or equal to `end`.

    #The program returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of constraints and values, determines a range based on specific constraints, and calculates how many additional numbers fall outside this range. It returns 0 if the range is invalid or if there are too many numbers inside the range; otherwise, it returns the count of numbers that can fit within the range without exceeding the given constraints.
