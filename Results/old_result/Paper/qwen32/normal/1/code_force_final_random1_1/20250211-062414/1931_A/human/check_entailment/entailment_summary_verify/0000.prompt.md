You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is determined by whether `n` is greater than 52, between 27 and 52, or between 3 and 26. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) into a lexicographically smallest 3-letter word.
- Each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26 (a=1, z=26).
- The sum of these numbers should equal `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to decode the integer `n` into a 3-letter word using the following logic:
1. If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
2. If `n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
3. Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Let's check if this logic covers all possible values of `n` and produces the lexicographically smallest word.

### Edge Cases and Testing:
1. **Minimum Value (`n = 3`)**:
   - Expected: `'aaa'` (1 + 1 + 1)
   - Actual: `'aa' + alphabet[0]` → `'aaa'`
   - This works correctly.

2. **Middle Values (`27 ≤ n ≤ 52`)**:
   - For `n = 27`, expected: `'aab'` (1 + 1 + 25)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[-1] + 'z'` → `'azz'` (incorrect)
   - For `n = 28`, expected: `'aac'` (1 + 1 + 26)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z'` → `'aaz'` (incorrect)
   - For `n = 29`, expected: `'aad'` (1 + 1 + 27)
   - Actual: `'a' + alphabet[1] + 'z'` → `'abz'` (correct)
   - This logic seems flawed for `n = 27` and `n = 28`.

3. **Maximum Value (`n = 78`)**:
   - Expected: `'zzz'` (26 + 26 + 26)
   - Actual: `alphabet[25] + 'zz'` → `'zzz'`
   - This works correctly.

4. **General Case (`53 ≤ n ≤ 78`)**:
   - For `n = 53`, expected: `'aaz'` (1 + 1 + 26)
   - Actual: `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` → `'azz'` (incorrect)
   - For `n = 54`, expected: `'aba'` (1 + 2 + 25)
   - Actual: `alphabet[1] + 'zz'` → `'bzz'` (incorrect)
   - This logic seems flawed for `n = 53` and `n = 54`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle the cases where `n` is between 27 and 52 correctly. Specifically, it fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for several values within this range.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where `n` is between 27 and 52, producing incorrect results for these values.
