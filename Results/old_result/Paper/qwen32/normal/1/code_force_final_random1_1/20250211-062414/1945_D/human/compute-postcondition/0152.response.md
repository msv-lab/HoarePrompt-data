The code appends the integer value of `y` to the list `a_values`. Since `a_values` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the integer value of `y`.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of substrings from the input.**
