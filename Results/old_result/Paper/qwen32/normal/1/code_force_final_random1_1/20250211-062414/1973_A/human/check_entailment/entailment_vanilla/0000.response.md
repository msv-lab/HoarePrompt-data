Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points (`total_points`) as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - Since each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw), `total_points` must be even. If it's not, the program correctly appends `-1` to the results list.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`.
   - This is correct because each match contributes 2 points.

3. **Validation of Total Matches**:
   - The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3. This check seems unnecessary since the maximum number of matches among three players can theoretically be more than 3 (for example, if each pair plays multiple games).
   - However, the program also checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is a valid check because `p3` cannot exceed the total number of matches played.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) using the formula: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is intended to isolate the points contributed by draws. Here's how it works:
     - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p2`, which must come from wins (since draws would give equal points to both players).
     - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p1`, which again must come from wins.
     - Subtracting these from `total_points` leaves only the points from draws.
   - The program then divides `egalites` by 2 to get the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.

5. **Final Check for Draws**:
   - The program checks if `egalites` is less than 0. If it is, it means the calculated points from draws are invalid, and the program appends `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results list.

### Issues Found:
- The check `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect and should be removed. As mentioned earlier, the maximum number of matches is not limited to 3.
- The logic for calculating draws is correct, but the implementation needs to ensure that the conditions leading to `-1` are properly handled.

### Corrected Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the function without the unnecessary check:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0 or egalites % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains an unnecessary check that incorrectly limits the number of matches. After removing this check and ensuring the final validation for draws is correct, the program should work as intended.

However, based on the provided code without modifications, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
