To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior based on the provided output states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `k-1`. For each iteration, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << i == 0`). If the condition is met, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the `i`-th position in the alphabet (`chr(ord('a') + i)`) and breaks out of the loop.

### Observations from Given States
1. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `tmp` is `'a'` if the 0-th bit of `cur` was not set.
   
2. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `tmp` is `'b'` if the 1-st bit of `cur` was not set.
   
3. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `tmp` is `'c'` if the 2-nd bit of `cur` was not set.

### Final Iteration Behavior
The loop will continue until either:
- It finds a bit in `cur` that is not set and assigns the corresponding character to `tmp`.
- It completes all iterations without finding any unset bits in `cur`.

### Final Output State
If `cur` has all its bits set up to `k-1`, the loop will iterate `k` times without setting `tmp` to any character and will exit naturally when `i` reaches `k`. In this case, `tmp` will remain an empty string.

However, if there is at least one bit that is not set, the loop will set `tmp` to the corresponding character and break out of the loop.

### Conclusion
The final output state depends on whether `cur` has any unset bits within the range `[0, k-1]`.

- If `cur` has no unset bits, `tmp` remains an empty string, and `i` will be equal to `k`.
- If `cur` has an unset bit at position `j`, `tmp` will be `chr(ord('a') + j)`, and `i` will be `j`.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the loop, we assume the worst-case scenario where `cur` has all bits set, leading to the loop completing all iterations without setting `tmp`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000; i is k; n, k, m remain the integers provided as input; s remains the string provided as input; cnt is the number of times k unique characters were found consecutively in s and cnt is less than n; cur is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters; ans contains the last character of each sequence of k unique characters; tmp is ''.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, and `tmp` will be an empty string if all bits in `cur` were set.
