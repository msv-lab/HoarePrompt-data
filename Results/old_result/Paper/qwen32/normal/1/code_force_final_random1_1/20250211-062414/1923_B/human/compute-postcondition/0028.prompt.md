Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `x` has at least one element; `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `sorted_indices` is a non-empty list of indices of `x` sorted by the absolute values of `x[i]`; `distance` is 0; `pos` is 0; the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`; `rest` is `k`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was originally greater than 0, it is now reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was originally 0, it remains 0 and `pos` is incremented to 1. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `x` has at least one element. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. `n` is the length of the list `a`. `sorted_indices` is a non-empty list of indices of `x` sorted by the absolute values of `x[i]`. `distance` is 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. The absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`. `rest` is `k - delta`. `delta` is `min(k, a[sorted_indices[pos-1]])` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, otherwise `delta` is `min(k, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0) is less than `k`. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `x` has at least one element. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. `n` is the length of the list `a`. `sorted_indices` is a non-empty list of indices of `x` sorted by the absolute values of `x[i]`. `distance` is 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. The absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`. `rest` is `k - 2 * delta`. `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is now `pos + 1` and is less than the length of `sorted_indices`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0) is less than `k`. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `x` has at least one element. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. `n` is the length of the list `a`. `sorted_indices` is a non-empty list of indices of `x` sorted by the absolute values of `x[i]`. `distance` is 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged. The absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`. `rest` is greater than 0. `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. `rest` is now `rest - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
