The given code modifies the value at index `i` of the list `d2` by setting it to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 4` and `n` is at least `5`, which means `i` is at least `1`.

Therefore, `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. This means the value at index `i` of `d2` is updated based on the value at index `i + 1` of `d2`.

Since no other variables are modified, the only change is to the element at index `i` in the list `d2`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 4` and `n` is at least `5`; `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`**.
