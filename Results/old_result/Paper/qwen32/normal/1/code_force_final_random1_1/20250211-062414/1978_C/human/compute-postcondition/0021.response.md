The only variable in the loop head is `i`, as it is the only variable explicitly mentioned in the `range` function. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c` do not directly influence the continuation of the loop according to the loop header.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(n, -1, -2)`, the loop decrements `i` by 2 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to decrement `i` by 2:

- Current `i` at the end of the previous iteration: `n - 2`
- `i` at the start of the next iteration: `(n - 2) - 2 = n - 4`

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop header and their values are not specified to change based on the loop's progression.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 2**
