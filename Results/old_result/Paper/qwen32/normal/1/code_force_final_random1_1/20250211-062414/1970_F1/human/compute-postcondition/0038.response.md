The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is currently some value (let's assume it was `i = 2` from the context of the previous iterations). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's denote it as `i = x`.
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

Therefore, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings; `i` is 3**
