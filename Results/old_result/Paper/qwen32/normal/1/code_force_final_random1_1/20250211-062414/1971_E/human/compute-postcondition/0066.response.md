To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the calculations leading up to this point.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n`, `k`, `q`: Integers read from the input, with `q > 0`.
- `a`: A list starting with 0, followed by integers read from the input.
- `b`: A list starting with 0, followed by integers read from the input.
- `ad`: A list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `bd`: A list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- `i`: Initialized to 1.
- `v`: A list containing elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
- `l`: Initialized to 2.
- `m`: Initially undefined but later updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql`: Initially undefined but later updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s`: The index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` and `b` are lists starting with 0, followed by integers.
   - `ad` and `bd` are computed as differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b` respectively.
   - `v` is constructed as a list of ratios of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.

2. **Updating `m`**:
   - `s` is determined using `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which finds the position where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - `m` is then updated using the formula: `m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
     - `b[s - 1]` is the element in `b` at index `s - 1`.
     - `bd[s]` is the difference between consecutive elements of `b` at index `s`.
     - `ql` is a value that has been adjusted by subtracting `a[s - 1]`.
     - `ad[s]` is the difference between consecutive elements of `a` at index `s`.

3. **Printing**:
   - The value of `m` is converted to an integer and printed.

### Explanation of Variables:
- `m`: This variable accumulates a value based on the indices and differences calculated from the lists `a` and `b`.
- `s`: This index is determined by where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`, which influences the calculation of `m`.
- `ql`: This value is adjusted by subtracting `a[s - 1]` and is used in the calculation of `m`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the calculations described, the output of the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will be the integer value of `m` after it has been updated according to the described formula.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
