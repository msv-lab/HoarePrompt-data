Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input provided by the user; `pk` is set to `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `zero` and `one`, both set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
