The code snippet `nx += 'S'` concatenates the character 'S' to the existing value of `nx`. Given that the initial state specifies that `nx` is an empty string, after executing the code, `nx` will be 'S'.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sa`, and the conditions involving `i` and `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **the final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is 'S', `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4]`.**
