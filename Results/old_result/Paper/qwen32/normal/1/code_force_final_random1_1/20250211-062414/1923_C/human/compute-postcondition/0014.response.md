The code increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `j` was initially 1 if `x` was equal to 1, otherwise `j` was 0. After the increment, `j` will be 2 if `x` was initially 1, or `j` will be 1 if `x` was not initially 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 1**.
