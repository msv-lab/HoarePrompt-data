The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables (`b_values`, `ans`, `m`, `curr`, `cnt_b`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 1**
