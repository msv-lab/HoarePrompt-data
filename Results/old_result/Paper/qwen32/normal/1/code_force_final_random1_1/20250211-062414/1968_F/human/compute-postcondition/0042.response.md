The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values directly. Therefore, none of the variables in the given initial state will be modified by this statement.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 6`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 5]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and `x` equals 0.**
