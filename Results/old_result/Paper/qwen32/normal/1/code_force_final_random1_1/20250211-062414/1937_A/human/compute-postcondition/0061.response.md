Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`. Specifically, for each test case, if `n` is within the range 1 to 10^9, the function performs some operation (not detailed here) and returns the corresponding result.**
