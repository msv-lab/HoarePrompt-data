To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet iterates over the indices from 1 to \( n-2 \) and updates the `d2` dictionary based on the differences in the list `l`. Specifically, for each index \( i \):

\[ d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1] \]

This means that `d2[i]` is updated to be the sum of the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` and the value of `d2[i + 1]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \)
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1
- For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `d2[i]` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \) will be updated according to the formula provided. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `d1` remain unchanged.

Let's express the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \); `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \) and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t`, `n`, and `l` remain the same, `d1` remains unchanged, and `d2` is updated such that each `d2[i]` from 1 to \( n-2 \) is calculated as the sum of the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` and `d2[i + 1]`, while `d2[n - 1]` remains 1.
