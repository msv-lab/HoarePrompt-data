The given code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to `l`. This means the previous list `l` is overwritten with the new input values. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in the original `l`, `c` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in the original `l`, `i` and `j` are integers that represent the final count of `1`s in the last processed sublist and the total count of `1`s in the original `l` respectively after the last iteration.**
