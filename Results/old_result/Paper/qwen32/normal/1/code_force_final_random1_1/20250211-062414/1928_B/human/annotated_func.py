#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not take any parameters and returns an integer, which is expected to be read from input.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the input and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`. This function is expected to read input from standard input, split it into a list of strings, convert each string to an integer, and return a map object containing these integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into individual components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3`. This function reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers derived from the input line, where each element in the list corresponds to an integer from the space-separated values in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits the line into space-separated values, converts each value to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers derived from the input string, where the input string consists of space-separated integer values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no input parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, which is expected to be a string of space-separated integer values, converts these values into integers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. This function does not have any parameters or return types specified in the provided code snippet.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element of the list obtained by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes no input parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits this line into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to a string (though they are already strings), and returns a map object representing these converted substrings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the provided function signature alone.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no input and returns a list of characters from a string provided by the user through standard input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_7`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the input, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` takes no input parameters, reads a line of input from the user, splits it into words, converts each word to a string, sorts these strings alphabetically, and returns the sorted list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of cumulative products of `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements up to that point in the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of cumulative products from the end of `arr` to the start.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the end of the input list up to the current position.
