The code snippet `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `num` was initially an empty list, after appending `v`, `num` will contain one element, which is `v`.

The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is either -1 or `v` depending on whether `start` was originally less than `v`, `v` is the second integer from the input, `end` is updated to `v` if `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, and `t` is equal to 3.**
