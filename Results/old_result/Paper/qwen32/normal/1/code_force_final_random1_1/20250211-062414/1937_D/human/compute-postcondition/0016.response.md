Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is either an empty list or a list with two elements `[a_0, x]` and now includes a third element `x`; `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'; `i` is incremented by 1; `x` is updated to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `A` now includes a new element `x`. All other variables retain their previous states except `A`, which has been updated to include the newly calculated `x`.
