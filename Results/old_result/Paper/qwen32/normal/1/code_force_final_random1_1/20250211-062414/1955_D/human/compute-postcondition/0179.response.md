Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `cnt_b` has its counts incremented by 1 for each element `b[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `m-1`; `n`, `m`, `k` are the values read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is explicitly set to 0 by the code. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
