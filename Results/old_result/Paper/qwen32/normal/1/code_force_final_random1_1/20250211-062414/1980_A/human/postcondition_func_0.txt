The function `func_1` calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. Each test case consists of a number of existing problems (`n`), a number of upcoming rounds (`m`), and a string representing the difficulties of the existing problems. The result for each test case indicates how many more problems are needed to ensure that for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', there are at least `m` problems available.
