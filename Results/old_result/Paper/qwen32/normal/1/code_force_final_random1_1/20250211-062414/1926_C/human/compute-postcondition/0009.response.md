The code divides `num` by 10 and converts the result back to an integer, effectively removing the last digit from `num`. Since `a` was initially the last digit of the original `num`, it remains unchanged. The new value of `num` is the original `num` with its last digit removed.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^4 (with the last digit removed); `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
