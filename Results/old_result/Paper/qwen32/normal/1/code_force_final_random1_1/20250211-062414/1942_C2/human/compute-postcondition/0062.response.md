The code snippet adds half the difference between the current and previous elements of the sorted list `a` to the variable `ans`. The variables `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged except for `ans`.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
