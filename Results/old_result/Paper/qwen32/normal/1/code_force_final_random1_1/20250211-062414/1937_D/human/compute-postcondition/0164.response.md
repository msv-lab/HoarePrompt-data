To determine the new value of `b`, we need to compute `b - B[x]`. Given the initial state:

- `b` is `B[r - 1]`
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`

However, the values of `r` and `l` are not specified in the initial state. To proceed, let's assume hypothetical values for `r` and `l` that satisfy the conditions and then compute the result.

Let's assume:
- `r = 3` (since `r` is not specified but must be within the bounds of `B`)
- `l = 0` (since `l` is not specified but must be a non-negative integer)

Then:
- `x = r - (l + 2) = 3 - (0 + 2) = 1`
- `b = B[r - 1] = B[3 - 1] = B[2] = 3` (from the initial state `B = [0, 1, 3]`)

Now, compute `b - B[x]`:
- `b = 3 - B[1] = 3 - 1 = 2`

Thus, the updated value of `b` is `2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `a` is 1, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is 2**.
