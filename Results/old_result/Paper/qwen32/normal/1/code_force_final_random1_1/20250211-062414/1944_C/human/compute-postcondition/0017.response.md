To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `arr`: A list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. There is at least one 0 in `arr`.
- `nums`: A Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. Initially, `nums[0]` is decreased by 1, and `nums[1]` is initially 2 or more but now is 1 or more.
- `start`: Set to 1.
- `vis`: A set containing the values 0 and 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `start` is explicitly given a value of 1.
- The print statement calculates `start + 1`.

Given that `start` is 1, the expression `start + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which equals 2.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the result of `start + 1`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
