The code assigns the value of the last element of the list `l` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, the list `l` starts with 1, then `n`, and then contains integers from 2 to `n-1`. Therefore, the last element of `l` is `n-1`.

Thus, `x` is updated to `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is `k - 3*i + 3`; `l` is a list starting with 1, then `n`, and then containing integers from 2 to `n-1`; `x` is `n-1`; `i` is `i`.**
