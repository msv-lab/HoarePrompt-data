To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 2.
3. **`res`**: A string input by the user.
4. **`i`**: Initially, it is stated as `i = i + 2`. This suggests that `i` was previously defined and then incremented by 2. However, the initial value of `i` is not explicitly given.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `'?'`: A literal question mark character.
- `0`: A literal integer zero.
- `k`: This variable is not defined in the initial state. Its value is unknown based on the given information.
- `0`: Another literal integer zero.
- `i`: As mentioned, `i` is `i + 2` from its previous value, but the initial value of `i` is not provided.

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the following sequence of values separated by spaces: `'?'`, `0`, `k`, `0`, and `i`.
- Since `k` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value.
- The value of `i` depends on its initial value, which is not specified. However, we know that the current value of `i` is its previous value plus 2.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `k` and the initial value of `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is an undefined variable and i is the previous value of i plus 2)**
