The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c` and `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0, and `cases` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum cost encountered up to `pos_final`**
