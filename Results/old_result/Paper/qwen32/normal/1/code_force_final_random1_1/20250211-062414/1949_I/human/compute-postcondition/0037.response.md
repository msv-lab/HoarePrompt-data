Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements set to `True`, and `visited[4]` is set to `True` if the if condition was met; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` and possibly other elements are `1`, and `coef[4]` is `1` if the if condition was met; `tot` is potentially updated based on the DFS traversal if the if condition was met; `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the graph properties, and it may have been updated if the if condition was met; `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)` if the if condition was met; `i` is 4.**
