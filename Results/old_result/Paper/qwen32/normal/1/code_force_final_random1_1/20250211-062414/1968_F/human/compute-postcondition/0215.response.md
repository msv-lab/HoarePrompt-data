Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` contains `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, and additionally contains `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` contains `'NO'`, `n` remains the same, `q` is `q - 1`, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[int(data[idx]) - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[int(data[idx]) - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[int(data[idx]) - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `r` has been updated to `int(data[idx + 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states as described.
