The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given the initial state, `L` initially contains two elements `[m, m]`. After appending `m` to `L`, `L` will contain three elements `[m, m, m]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing three elements `[m, m, m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
