### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not address the core logic required to solve the problem described. Let's break down the requirements and the given code to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Maximum Indices**: Read the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
3. **Count Valid Permutations**: Calculate the number of permutations of length `n` such that the given indices are the prefix and suffix maximums.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Given Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function appears to compute something related to modular arithmetic, possibly the modular inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
2. **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses `func_1` to perform a modular multiplication.

However, these functions do not contain any logic to:
- Parse the input for each test case.
- Determine the valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
- Count these permutations.

The code lacks the necessary combinatorial logic to solve the problem as described. It only provides some utility functions for modular arithmetic, which might be useful later in the implementation but are not sufficient on their own.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the main logic required to solve the problem. The code needs additional functionality to parse the input and count the valid permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
