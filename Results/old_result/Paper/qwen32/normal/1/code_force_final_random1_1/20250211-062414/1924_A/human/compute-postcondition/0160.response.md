To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `k` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string read from the input
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`
- The behavior of `cur` and `tmp` is described based on the condition `if cur & 1 << i == 0`

Since the loop iterates over `i` in the range of `k`, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration and the loop increments `i` by 1)
- All other variables (`k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`**
