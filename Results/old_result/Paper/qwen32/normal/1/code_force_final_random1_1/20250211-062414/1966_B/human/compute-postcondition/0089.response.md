The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `tc` should be the current value of `tc` plus 1, as long as it is still less than `t`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `tc` has just been incremented by 1, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1 (so `tc` is now the previous `tc` + 1)**

Since only `tc` is relevant to the loop condition, we don't need to adjust the other variables. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `impossible`) retain their previous values unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1**
