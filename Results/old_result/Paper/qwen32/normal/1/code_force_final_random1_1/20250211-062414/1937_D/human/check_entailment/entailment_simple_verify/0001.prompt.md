You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We have a grid with `n` cells, each containing either '<' or '>'.
- A pinball starts at each cell `i` and moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the cell.
- The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
- The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this problem efficiently using two auxiliary arrays, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements for '>' and '<' directions respectively. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the grid size `n` and the grid string `s` are read.
   - Two functions, `func_1`, are called to process the grid string and compute the required results.

2. **Processing '>' Directions**:
   - An array `A` is used to store the cumulative movements for cells containing '>' from left to right.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the indices of these cells.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '>' cells and stores it in `A`.
     - The index `i` is added to `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Directions**:
   - An array `B` is used to store the cumulative movements for cells containing '<' from right to left.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the indices of these cells.
   - For each cell `i` (from right to left):
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '<' cells and stores it in `B`.
     - The index `i` is added to `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Results**:
   - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to traverse `A` and `B` respectively.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using values from `A` and `B`.
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it performs similar calculations but in reverse order.
   - The result for each cell is printed.

### Issues in the Program:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and the final time taken for the pinball to leave the grid seems flawed. The formulas used do not correctly account for the inversion of characters and the resulting changes in direction.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The handling of boundary conditions (when the pinball leaves the grid) is not correctly implemented.
3. **Complexity**: The approach appears overly complex and may not handle all edge cases efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and complexity, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
