In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the value obtained from `int(input())`. This means the number of iterations of the loop depends on the user input converted to an integer. The variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input provided to `int(input())` results in a positive integer. Since the loop variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function, we don't need to set its initial value manually.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
2. The current state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78. However, these variables (`t` and `n`) are not directly related to the loop control.
3. The `alphabet` string is also not related to the loop control.
4. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

Given this, the state should be adjusted to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since `t` is already within the range 1 to 100, we can use `t` as the input to `int(input())` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and the input to `int(input())` is `t`**
