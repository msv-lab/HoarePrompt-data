Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is either an empty list, a list with two elements `[a_0, x]`, a list with three elements `[a_0, x, 0]`, or updated with its last element as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` and a new element `x` appended; `idx_A` is either an empty list or contains the previous elements plus the new element `i` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'; `i` is [previous value of i] + 1; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` if `idx_A` is not empty.**
