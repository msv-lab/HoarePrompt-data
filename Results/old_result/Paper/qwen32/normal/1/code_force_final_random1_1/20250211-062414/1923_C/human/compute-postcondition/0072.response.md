Given the initial state and the code snippet, here's the output state:

The code snippet `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element.
- `p` is `[0, i, i]` where `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `x`.
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`.
- If `x` is 1, then `c` is `[0, j+1, j+1]`. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.

After executing `i += x`, the value of `i` changes. Since `i` was initially the next element in the list `l` plus `x`, and now we add `x` to it again, the new value of `i` is the initial value of `i` plus `x` twice.

Thus, the updated value of `i` is the original `i` (which is the next element in `l` plus `x`) plus `x` again. This means `i` is now the next element in `l` plus `2*x`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged unless `x` is 1, in which case `c` is updated to `[0, j+1, j+1]`. However, since the problem does not specify what `j` is, we assume `c` remains unchanged unless explicitly stated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]` where `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `2*x`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, and `c` is unchanged unless `x` is 1, in which case `c` is `[0, j+1, j+1]`.**
