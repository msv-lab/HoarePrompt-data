### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given functions and their roles in solving the problem.

#### Function `func_1(a, x, k)`:
- This function takes three parameters: `a` (a list of integers representing the health of each monster), `x` (a list of integers representing the positions of each monster), and `k` (an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second).
- The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute positions from the origin (point 0).
- It then iterates through the sorted list of monsters, checking if any monster can reach the origin before being defeated. If a monster is found that can reach the origin before being defeated, the function returns `False`.
- If all monsters can be defeated before reaching the origin, the function returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function handles the input reading and output generation for multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n`, the maximum number of bullets `k`, the list of health values `a`, and the list of positions `x`.
- It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` for each test case and prints 'YES' if the result is `True` (indicating that all monsters can be defeated before reaching the origin), otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- The problem requires determining whether it is possible to kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (point 0).
- The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by sorting the monsters by their proximity to the player and ensuring that the player can defeat each monster before it reaches the origin.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and formats the output as required.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
