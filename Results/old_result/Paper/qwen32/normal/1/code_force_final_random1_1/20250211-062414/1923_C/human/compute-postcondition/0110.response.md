Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is [0], `c` is [0], `i` is `i + x`, `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. All other variables retain their initial values.
