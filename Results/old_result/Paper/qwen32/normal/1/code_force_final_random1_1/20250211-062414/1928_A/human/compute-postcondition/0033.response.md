To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how it processes each test case.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Loop Head:** `for i in range(int(input())):` 
  - This means the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as the first input.
  
- **Loop Body:**
  - For each iteration, the code reads two integers `a` and `b`.
  - It checks the following conditions:
    - If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`), it prints `'yes'`.
    - If either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a` (`(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`), it prints `'no'`. However, this condition seems incorrect due to a syntax error. It should likely be checking `a == 2*b` or `b == 2*a`.
    - If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero (`(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`), it prints `'yes'`. This condition is always true if `a != b` because the modulo operation on a non-zero number with 2 will result in either 1 or -1, which are both non-zero.
    - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `'no'`. This scenario would only occur if `a` and `b` are both zero, but given the constraints `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`, this is impossible.

### Simplified Logic:
Given the conditions and the constraints, the simplified logic of the loop is:
- If `a` and `b` are both even, print `'yes'`.
- If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, print `'no'`.
- If `a` and `b` are not equal, print `'yes'`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the output will be a series of `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the above logic.

**Output State:** **The loop will have printed 'yes' or 'no' for each of the `t` test cases based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, and the values of `a` and `b` will reflect the last test case processed.**

In natural language: After processing all test cases, the loop will have printed either 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, depending on whether both numbers are even, one is double the other, or they are not equal. The loop counter `i` will have reached the value of `t`, and `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last test case.
