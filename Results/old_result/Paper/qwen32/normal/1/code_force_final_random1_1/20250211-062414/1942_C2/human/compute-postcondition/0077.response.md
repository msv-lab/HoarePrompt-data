Postcondition: **tt is greater than 0; n, x, and y are integers obtained from the input; a is a sorted list of integers with len(a) > 1; ii is incremented by 1; tmp is a list containing all applicable half-differences as described; ans is the sum of x + y - 2 plus the increments due to differences of 2 and applicable even differences; the sum of a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] is even and y is greater than (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1**
