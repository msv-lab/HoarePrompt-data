Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'No'`. This output does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- The value of `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- The values of `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input, but they are not used in the provided code snippet.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not influence the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
