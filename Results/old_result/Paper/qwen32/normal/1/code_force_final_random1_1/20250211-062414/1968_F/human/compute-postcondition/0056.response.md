Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 8`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` twice if `x` equals 0 and the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` contains the string `'YES'` once if `x` equals 0, or `'NO'` if the condition is false; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `q` is decreased by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `idx` has been incremented by 2, changing its value from `n + 6` to `n + 8`. All other variables retain their previous values and meanings as described in the initial state.
