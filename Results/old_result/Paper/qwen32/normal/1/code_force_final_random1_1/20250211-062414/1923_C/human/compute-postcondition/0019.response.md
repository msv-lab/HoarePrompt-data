The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to reflect the value it will take in the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element being processed from the list `l`.
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `x` should be updated to the next element in the list `l`.

Let's denote the current index of `x` in the list `l` as `current_index`. Since `x` was the element at `current_index` in the previous iteration, it should now be the element at `current_index + 1` for the next iteration.

However, we don't have the exact `current_index` in the given state, but we know that `x` is the current element being processed. To move to the next iteration, we simply need to acknowledge that `x` will be the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x, 2 * x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `2 * x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 1; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Since the exact next element cannot be determined without knowing the current position of `x` in `l`, we express the state in terms of `x` being the next element in the list `l`.
