You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: `data` is a list of strings split from the input line such that `data[idx - 3 - n]` is a positive integer, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element being `''`, and the last element being `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise `results` remains unchanged with `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are integers from `data` starting at the position `idx - n - 2` up to `idx - 3`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element from index `1` to `n` contains the prefix XOR value, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the position where `l` would fit in `v1` if `v1` were sorted. `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
if condition:
```
if (it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else. 
Provide the postcondition in Natural language easily understandable by humans. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
