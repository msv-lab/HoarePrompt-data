To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. However, the variable `r` is not defined in the initial state or the given code snippet. Since `r` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific value for `a`.

Given the lack of a specific value for `r`, the best we can do is express `a` in terms of `r`.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.

In natural language: The value of `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, where `r` is an undefined variable. All other variables retain their initial values.
