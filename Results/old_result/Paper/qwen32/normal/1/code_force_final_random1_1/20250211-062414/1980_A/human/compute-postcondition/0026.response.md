The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `_` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `freq` is `[0, k, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `missing` is `7m - k if m > k else 6m`
- `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged
- `n` and `m` are updated to the first two elements of `test_cases[_]`
- `a` is updated to the third element of `test_cases[_]`
- `results` now includes `missing`

Since only the loop counter `_` can be adjusted, we increment `_` by 1.

State: **`freq` is [0, k, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m; `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two elements of `test_cases[_]`; `a` is updated to the third element of `test_cases[_]`; `results` now includes `missing`; `_` is incremented by 1**
