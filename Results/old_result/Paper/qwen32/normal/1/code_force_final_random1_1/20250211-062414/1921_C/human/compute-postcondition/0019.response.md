Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list that may include the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `array2` will contain the values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` holds true. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
