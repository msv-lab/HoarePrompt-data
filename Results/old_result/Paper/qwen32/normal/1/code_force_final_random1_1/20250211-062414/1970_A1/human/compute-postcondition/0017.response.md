Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects, the first with the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`, the second with the current `balance + 1`, `i + 1`, and `s[i + 1]`, and the third with the current `balance + 1`, `i`, and `s[i]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `balance` variable has been incremented by 1. The `s` string, `n` (length of `s`), and `i` remain unchanged. The `balance_info` list now reflects the updated `balance` value in the second and third `BalanceInfo` objects.
