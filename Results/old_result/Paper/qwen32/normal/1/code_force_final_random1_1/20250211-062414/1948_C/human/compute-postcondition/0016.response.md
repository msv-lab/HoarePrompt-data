The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It only terminates the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but since no loop or conditional block is specified in the context, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is a string; `i` is 7 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
