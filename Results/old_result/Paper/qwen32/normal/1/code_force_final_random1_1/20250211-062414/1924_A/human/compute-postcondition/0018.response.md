The code snippet calculates the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', and assigns this difference to `cur_ss`. 

Given that `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, and assuming `ss` is a lowercase letter (since the subtraction is done relative to 'a'), `cur_ss` will be an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.
