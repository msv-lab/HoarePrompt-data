Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. This represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `n` is a newly input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. This represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, each satisfying 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- `ntest` must be greater than 1, indicating there are multiple test cases.
- `itest` is set to 1, indicating this is the first iteration of a loop over test cases.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Explanation:
- `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, this is the largest element in the list.
- `a[0]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, this is the smallest element in the list.
- The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

### Output:
Given that `a` is sorted in ascending order, the difference between the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) is simply the range of the values in the list.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`**
