You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of monsters, their health values, their positions, and the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters under the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis

#### Function `func_1(a, x, k)`:
1. **Sorting by Distance**: The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character (point 0).
2. **Processing Monsters**: It processes the monsters in order of their distance from the character.
3. **Distance Check**: Before processing monsters at a certain distance, it checks if any monster is already at distance 0 (i.e., at point 0). If so, it returns `False` because the character would be killed.
4. **Firing Bullets**: It fires up to `k` bullets at the monsters at the current distance, reducing their health accordingly.
5. **Increment Distance**: After processing all monsters at the current distance, it increments the distance and continues.

#### Function `func_2()`:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Calling `func_1`**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the respective parameters and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

### Potential Issues

1. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **Monsters at Distance 0 Initially**: The function correctly handles the case where any monster starts at distance 0 by returning `False`.
   - **Monsters Moving to Distance 0**: The function correctly checks if any monster reaches distance 0 during processing.
   
2. **Bullet Allocation**:
   - The function allocates up to `k` bullets optimally by targeting monsters at the current distance until either all bullets are used or all monsters at that distance are defeated.
   
3. **Incrementing Distance**:
   - The function correctly increments the distance after processing all monsters at the current distance.

### Testing the Code

Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases to ensure the correctness of the code.

#### Provided Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  ```
  3 2
  1 2 3
  -1 2 3
  ```
  - The function should return `True` (YES).
  
- **Example 2**:
  ```
  2 1
  1 1
  -1 1
  ```
  - The function should return `False` (NO).
  
- **Example 3**:
  ```
  4 10
  3 4 2 5
  -3 -2 1 3
  ```
  - The function should return `True` (YES).
  
- **Example 4**:
  ```
  5 3
  2 1 3 2 5
  -3 -2 3 4 5
  ```
  - The function should return `True` (YES).
  
- **Example 5**:
  ```
  2 1
  1 2
  1 2
  ```
  - The function should return `False` (NO).

All these examples seem to be handled correctly by the function.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
- **Single Monster**:
  ```
  1 1
  1
  -1
  ```
  - The function should return `True` (YES).
  
- **Multiple Monsters Same Distance**:
  ```
  3 3
  1 1 1
  -1 0 1
  ```
  - The function should return `False` (NO) because one monster is initially at distance 0.

- **Monsters Far Away**:
  ```
  3 10
  1 1 1
  -10 -5 5
  ```
  - The function should return `True` (YES).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and testing it against various cases, including the provided examples and additional edge cases, the function appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The function correctly handles the sorting of monsters by distance, checks for monsters reaching distance 0, optimally allocates bullets, and processes each distance incrementally. All tested cases, including edge cases, produce the expected results.
