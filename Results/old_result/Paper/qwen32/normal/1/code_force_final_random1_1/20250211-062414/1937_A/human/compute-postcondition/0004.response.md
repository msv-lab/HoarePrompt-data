Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement directly prints the integer `1` to the console. It does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `n`) mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the number `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
