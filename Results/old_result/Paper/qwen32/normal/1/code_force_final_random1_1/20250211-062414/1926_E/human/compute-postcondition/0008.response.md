To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `while n:`. This loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing one element `[m]`.
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

We need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute one more time. Let's analyze the expression for `n`:

\[ n = n - \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ n = n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \]

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be non-zero after this operation. Therefore, we need to ensure that the new value of `n` is not zero.

Let's consider the possible values of `n`:
- If `n` is odd, say `n = 2k + 1`, then \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = k + 1\), and \(n = (2k + 1) - (k + 1) = k\).
- If `n` is even, say `n = 2k`, then \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = k\), and \(n = 2k - k = k\).

In both cases, the new value of `n` is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \). For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 before the operation because if `n` is 1, the new value of `n` will be 0, and the loop will terminate.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing one element `[m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
