To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `final` is a sorted list.
   - If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain either the element `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50.
   - All other variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) remain unchanged.

2. **Condition to Consider**:
   - Since `final` is initially a sorted list, it could be empty or non-empty.
   - If `final` is empty (`len(final) == 0`), it gets updated based on the value of `c1`.

3. **Value of `c1`**:
   - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
   - Depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, `final` will be updated to `[0]` or `[n]` respectively.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(final[0])`.
   - This means we need to know the first element of `final` after any potential update.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Case 1: `final` is not empty (`len(final) != 0`)**:
  - In this case, `final` remains unchanged.
  - The first element of `final` will be the smallest element in the sorted list `final` (since it's sorted).

- **Case 2: `final` is empty (`len(final) == 0`)**:
  - Here, `final` gets updated based on the value of `c1`.
  - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`.
  - If `c1 < 50`, `final` becomes `[n]`.

### Conclusion:

- If `final` was initially non-empty, the output will be the smallest element of the sorted list `final`.
- If `final` was initially empty, the output will be either `0` or `n` depending on the value of `c1`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `o`, and the initial state of `final` are not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the conditions given.

Output: **the first element of `final` (where `final` is updated to `[0]` if `c1 >= 50` or `[n]` if `c1 < 50` when initially empty, otherwise it remains the smallest element of the sorted `final`)**
