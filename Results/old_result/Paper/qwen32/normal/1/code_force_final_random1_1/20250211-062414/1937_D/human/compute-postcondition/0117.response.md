Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`. If `s[i]` is `'>'`, then `l` is set to 1, and if `l < r`, `r` remains 3, `a` is set to `0` if `r` is 3, otherwise `a` is set to `3 - 3 * i`, and `b` is set to `3`. If `s[i]` is not `'>'`, then if `l` is 0 and `r` is greater than 0, `r` is set to 2. If `l` is not 0 and `r` is greater than 0, `l` remains 0, `r` is set to 2, `a` is set to 3, and `b` is set to `2 * i`. If `r` was initially 0, `r` remains 0, and `l` is not greater than `r`. Otherwise, `r` is set to 2, `a` is set to 3, `l` is not greater than `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, and `b` is set to `(i - 3) * 3`.**
