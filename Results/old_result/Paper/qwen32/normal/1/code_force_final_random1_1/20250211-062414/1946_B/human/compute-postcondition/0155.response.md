To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the state with each iteration. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it processes a new pair of integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `l`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each iteration and the final output state:

### Iteration Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read two integers `n` and `k`.
   - Read a list of `n` integers `l`.

2. **Suffix Sum Calculation (`suf`):**
   - Initialize `suf` with `[0]`.
   - Compute cumulative sums of `l` and append them to `suf`.

3. **Minimum Suffix Sum Calculation (`smin`):**
   - Initialize `smin` with `[0]`.
   - For each element in `suf`, append the minimum value encountered so far to `smin`.

4. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation (`sm`):**
   - Initialize `sm` to `-111`.
   - For each index `i` in `suf`, update `sm` to the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
   - Adjust `sm` using the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`.
   - Add the total sum of the list `l` (i.e., `suf[n]`) to `sm`.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - If `sm` is negative, adjust it to be positive using modulo operation with `10^9 + 7`.
   - Otherwise, take `sm` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Output:**
   - Print the final value of `sm`.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed `t` different sets of inputs, each resulting in a computed value of `sm`. Each iteration is independent of the others except for the fact that they share the same initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l`.

The final output state is simply the result of the last iteration of the loop, as each iteration prints its own result and does not affect the results of subsequent iterations.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is the result of the last iteration of the loop. Since each iteration is independent and the state is reset for each new input, the final output state is determined solely by the last set of inputs.

**Output State:** **The result of the last iteration of the loop, which is the final value of `sm` after processing the last set of inputs.**

In natural language: The final output state is the result of the computation performed in the last iteration of the loop, specifically the value of `sm` after processing the last set of inputs `n`, `k`, and `l`. This value is printed at the end of the last iteration.
