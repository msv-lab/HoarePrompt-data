The code snippet calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. 

Given the initial state, `lk` is now the length of `bk`, which is the binary representation of `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`; `k` is not equal to 1; `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is an empty list; `lk` is the length of `bk`.**
