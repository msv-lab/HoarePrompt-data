The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now contains one more element than before, specifically the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.

Output State: **Queue is not empty (now with one more element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start including `neighbor`, current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the queue popped from the queue, `tree[current]` must have at least one element, and `neighbor` is not in the visited set anymore.**
