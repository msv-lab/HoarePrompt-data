Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters with the condition that `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `tmp` is `'a'` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
