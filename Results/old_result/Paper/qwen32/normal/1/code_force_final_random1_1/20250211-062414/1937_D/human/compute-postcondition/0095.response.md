The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `b`. Given the initial state, `r` is 2, and `B` is `[0, 1, 3]`. Therefore, `b` will be assigned the value `3`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, `a = 3`, `b = 3`**
