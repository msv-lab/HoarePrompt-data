### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether the functions collectively solve the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the functions:

#### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The program should handle multiple test cases efficiently.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Input Reading Functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`)**:
   - These functions are responsible for reading input from standard input. They correctly parse integers and lists of integers from the input, which is necessary for handling multiple test cases.
   
2. **Main Logic (`func_15`)**:
   - `func_15` is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given pair of (n, m).
   - The implementation iterates through possible values of `i` and sums up `(n + i) // (i * i)` until `i * i > n + i`.
   - The final result is `ans - 1`.

3. **Execution Loop (`func_16`)**:
   - `func_16` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case and writing the result to standard output.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Main Logic (`func_15`)**:
  - The provided `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement.
  - The formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the logic in `func_15` needs to be revised. A correct approach involves iterating over possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the current implementation of `func_15` does not solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
