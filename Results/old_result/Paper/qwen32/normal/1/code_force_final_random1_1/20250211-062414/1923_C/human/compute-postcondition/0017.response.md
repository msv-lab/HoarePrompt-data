The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is `2 * x`, the list `p` will now contain three elements: `[0, x, 2 * x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x, 2 * x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `2 * x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 1.**
