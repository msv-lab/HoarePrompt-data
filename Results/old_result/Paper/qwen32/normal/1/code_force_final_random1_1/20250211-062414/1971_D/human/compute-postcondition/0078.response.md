Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer; `s` is the new input string with length at least 3; `count` is 2 if the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1`, otherwise `count` remains 1; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1; `i` is `i + 1`. Specifically, if the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1`, then `count` is 3. If the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', then `flag` is True.**
