The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given the initial state, `n` remains unchanged as it is only a condition that `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

After executing the line `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])`, the list `suf` will have a new element added to it, which is the sum of the `i`-th elements of `suf` and `l`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `suf` has a new element appended which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.**
