In the given task, the for loop iterates over the elements of the `ops` list, where each element is a tuple `(l, r)`. To ensure the loop executes, the `ops` list must contain at least one tuple.

Let's break down the components in the loop head:
- The loop variable is `(l, r)`, which means the loop will iterate over each tuple in the `ops` list.

Given this, the only object in the loop head that we can adjust is `ops`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `s`, `m`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `ops` must be a list containing at least one tuple. We do not need to specify the exact values of `l` and `r` since they are just placeholders for the elements in the tuples.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple**
