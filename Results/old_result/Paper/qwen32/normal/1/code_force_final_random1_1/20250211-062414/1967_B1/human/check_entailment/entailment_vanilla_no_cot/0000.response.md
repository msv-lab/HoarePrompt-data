Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why it fails:

1. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which means the program starts checking from `b=2`. However, it should also consider the case when `b=1`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which assumes that all pairs `(a, 1)` are valid, but this needs to be verified by the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. For `b=1`, this condition is always true since `gcd(a, 1) = 1`.

2. **Loop and Condition Checking:**
   - The loop increments `count` and calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`. This part seems to be an attempt to count multiples of `count` up to `n`, but it does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem.
   - The condition `if g < countmins: break` does not align with the problem's requirements. It seems to be an incorrect way to terminate the loop.
   - The calculation `g -= countmins` and then `ans += int(g / count) + 1` does not correctly count the valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given condition.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The program does not correctly iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` and check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - A correct approach would involve iterating through all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and checking the condition directly.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
