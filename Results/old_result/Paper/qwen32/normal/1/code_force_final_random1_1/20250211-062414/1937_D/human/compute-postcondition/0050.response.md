The value of `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`. Given that `j` is `j_old + 1`, we can express `i` as `n - 1 - (j_old + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - 2 - j_old`.

The values of `A`, `idx_A`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`**.
