Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on its initial value before the if statement. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged. `i` is `x + 1`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` could be 2, 3, or 4 based on its initial value; otherwise, `ans` remains as initially determined.**
