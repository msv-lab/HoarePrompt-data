### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program: the recurrence relation used in the `func_1` function does not accurately model the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard with some positions already occupied and considering the mirroring rule.

Let's break down the issues more thoroughly:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other, taking into account the mirroring rule and the fact that some positions are already occupied by previous moves.
   - The mirroring rule adds complexity: if a player places a rook at \((r, c)\), the computer places a rook at \((c, r)\) unless \(r = c\), in which case the computer skips its turn.

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The provided recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` does not account for the constraints imposed by the mirroring rule and the already occupied positions.
   - The relation seems to be derived from a simpler problem of counting permutations or combinations without considering the specific rules of the game.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The dynamic programming approach should consider the state of the board after each move, including the positions that are already occupied and the effect of the mirroring rule.
   - The current implementation does not handle these constraints properly, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program but do not address the logical flaws in the recurrence relation and the handling of the mirroring rule.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The recurrence relation and the overall logic do not accurately model the constraints and rules of the game.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
