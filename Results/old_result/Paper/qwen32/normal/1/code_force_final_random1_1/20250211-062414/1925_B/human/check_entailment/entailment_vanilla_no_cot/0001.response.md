To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the maximum possible balance (GCD) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum equals `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of these integers.

### Key Observations

1. **Divisibility**: For a number `i` to be a candidate for the GCD, `x` must be divisible by `i`.
2. **Partitioning**: If `i` is a divisor of `x`, we need to check if we can partition `x` into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `i`.
3. **Checking Feasibility**: To partition `x` into `n` parts, each being a multiple of `i`, the remaining part after subtracting `n*i` from `x` should also be divisible by `i`.

### Program Logic

1. **Iterate through potential divisors**: The program iterates over all integers `i` from `1` to `sqrt(x)`.
2. **Check divisibility**: For each `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
3. **Check partition feasibility**:
   - It checks if `x - n*i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
   - It also checks the same conditions for the corresponding divisor `x//i`.
4. **Update the maximum GCD**: If the above conditions are satisfied, it updates the maximum GCD found so far.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking `i = 1`: Possible, `x - n*i = 7`, not divisible by 1.
   - Checking `i = 2`: Possible, `x - n*i = 4`, divisible by 2. Balance = 2.
   - Checking `i = 5`: Not possible since `x - n*i = -5`.
   - Checking `i = 10`: Not possible since `x - n*i = -20`.
   - Maximum balance = 2.

2. **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - Checking `i = 1`: Possible, `x - n*i = 0`, divisible by 1. Balance = 1.
   - Checking `i = 5`: Not possible since `x - n*i = -20`.
   - Maximum balance = 1.

3. **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - Checking `i = 6`: Possible, `x - n*i = 6`, divisible by 6. Balance = 6.
   - Other divisors do not yield a higher balance.
   - Maximum balance = 6.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance by checking all possible divisors and verifying if they can form a valid partition. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
