To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `len(arr)`, and the range parameters.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will iterate over the indices of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) down to `0`.

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: This is the loop variable that will take on values from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.
- **`len(arr) - 1`**: This is the starting point of the loop.
- **`-1`**: This is the stopping point of the loop (non-inclusive).
- **`-1`**: This is the step, indicating that `i` will decrement by 1 in each iteration.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `len(arr)` is greater than 0. If `len(arr)` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- The initial value of `i` should be `len(arr) - 1` before the loop starts, but this is automatically set by the `range` function when the loop begins.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `arr` has at least one element so that `len(arr) - 1` is a valid starting index.
- No specific adjustment is needed for `i` since it is initialized by the `range` function.
- `ans` and `tem` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**

This ensures that the loop can execute by having a non-empty list `arr`.
