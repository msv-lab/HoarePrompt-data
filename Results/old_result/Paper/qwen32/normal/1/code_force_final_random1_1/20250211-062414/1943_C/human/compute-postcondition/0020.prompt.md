Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `n` is the input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    u -= 1
    v -= 1
    u2vs[u].append(v)
    u2vs[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` additionally contains `u`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` contains `u` at least twice; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input with `u` decreased by 1 and `v` decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v` at least three times, and the list at index `v` contains `u` at least three times; `u` is one less than the original integer read from the input, `v` is one less than the original integer read from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
