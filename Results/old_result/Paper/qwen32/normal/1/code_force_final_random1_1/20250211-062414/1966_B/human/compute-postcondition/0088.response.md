Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Relationships:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n`: An integer greater than or equal to `i`.
   - `m`: The second integer from the input.
   - `gr`: A list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input string.
   - `i`: Set to `n - 1`.
   - `j`: Retains its previous value.
   - `tc`: Incremented by 1.
   - `impossible`: A boolean flag.
   - `ans`: A string that can be either 'YES' or 'NO'.

2. **Conditional Logic:**
   - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`:
     - `j` is set to `m - 2`.
     - `tc` is incremented by `n - 1`.
     - If `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
   - If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`:
     - `ans` remains 'YES'.
     - Other variables retain their previous values.

### Analysis:

The key to determining the output lies in the value of `ans`. According to the conditions:

- If the characters at positions `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` are different, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
- If the characters at these positions are the same, `ans` remains 'YES'.

Given that the code snippet only contains the `print(ans)` statement, the output will be the value of `ans`.

### Conclusion:

Based on the initial state and the conditions described, the value of `ans` can either be 'YES' or 'NO'. Since the specific values of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether they are equal or not. However, we know that `ans` will be set to 'YES' if they are equal, and 'NO' otherwise.

Thus, the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the comparison of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'NO')**
