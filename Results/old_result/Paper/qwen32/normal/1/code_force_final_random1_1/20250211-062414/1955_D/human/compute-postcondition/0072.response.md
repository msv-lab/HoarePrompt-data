Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `n` is greater than `m`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`.**
