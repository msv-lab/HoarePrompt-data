### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- **Purpose**: To handle the case when the subarray from index `l` to `r` needs to be modified to maximize the sum.
- **Logic**:
  - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If not, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation.
  - For the general case (`l < r`), it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`. After returning from the recursion, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (which is intended to be the MEX of the subarray). If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
- **Issues**:
  - The logic assumes that `r - l + 1` is the MEX of the subarray, which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not just `r - l + 1`.
  - The recursive call `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` modifies the subarray starting from `l + 1` to `r`, but the subsequent check and assignment do not ensure that the MEX is correctly computed.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a)`
- **Purpose**: Initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
- **Logic**:
  - Initializes `ops` as an empty list.
  - Calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to process the entire array.
  - Returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not pass `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`, which leads to undefined behavior since `ops` is not defined within `recursive_maximize_sum`.

#### Function 3: `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- **Purpose**: Recursively maximizes the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
- **Logic**:
  - Calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and sets all elements to `r - l + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum element.
- **Issues**:
  - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a reliable way to determine whether the subarray needs modification.
  - The logic for modifying the subarray is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX.
  - The function does not receive `ops` as an argument, leading to undefined behavior.

#### Function 4: `func_3()`
- **Purpose**: Reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the input values.
  - Calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and operations.
  - Prints the results.
- **Issues**:
  - The issues in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` propagate to this function, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately identifies several critical flaws in the program:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The functions do not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray.
2. **Incorrect Use of `ops`**: The `ops` list is not properly passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to undefined behavior.
3. **Flawed Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The logic used to decide whether to modify a subarray and how to do it is flawed and does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
