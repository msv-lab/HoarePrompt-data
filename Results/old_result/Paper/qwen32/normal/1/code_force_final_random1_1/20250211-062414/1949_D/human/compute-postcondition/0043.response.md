Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index 4 incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise incremented by 1 for each 'F' in `x` at corresponding positions, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented by 1 for each 'S' in `x` at corresponding positions, specifically `b[4]` is incremented by an additional 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 more if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the previous input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, and `i` is 4.**
