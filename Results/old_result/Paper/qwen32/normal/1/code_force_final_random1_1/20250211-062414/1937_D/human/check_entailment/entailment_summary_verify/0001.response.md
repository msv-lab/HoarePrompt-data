To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
- A pinball placed on a cell moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the cell.
- The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
- We need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The code uses two auxiliary arrays, `A` and `B`, to keep track of cumulative movements for '>' and '<' directions respectively. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Processing '>' Directions**:
   - `A` stores cumulative movements for cells containing '>' from left to right.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the indices of these cells.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '>' cells and stores it in `A`.
     - The index `i` is added to `idx_A`.

2. **Processing '<' Directions**:
   - `B` stores cumulative movements for cells containing '<' from right to left.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the indices of these cells.
   - For each cell `i` (from right to left):
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '<' cells and stores it in `B`.
     - The index `i` is added to `idx_B`.

3. **Calculating Results**:
   - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to traverse `A` and `B` respectively.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using values from `A` and `B`.
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it performs similar calculations but in reverse order.
   - The result for each cell is printed.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and the final time taken for the pinball to leave the grid seems flawed. The formulas used do not correctly account for the inversion of characters and the resulting changes in direction.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The handling of boundary conditions (when the pinball leaves the grid) is not correctly implemented.
- **Complexity**: The approach appears overly complex and may not handle all edge cases efficiently.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes the grid string and computes the required results. However, the summary does not provide enough detail to confirm the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code has significant issues with its logic and does not correctly solve the problem as described. The complexity and the way cumulative movements are calculated suggest that the program does not handle the problem requirements accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
