Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a matrix of size `n x n` representing transition videos between scenarios. Each element in the matrix can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (indicating no transition needed when i=j). The function returns a valid configuration of the matrix where at most ⌊n/2⌋ transitions are either 'F' or 'S', ensuring symmetry and consistency across the matrix.**
