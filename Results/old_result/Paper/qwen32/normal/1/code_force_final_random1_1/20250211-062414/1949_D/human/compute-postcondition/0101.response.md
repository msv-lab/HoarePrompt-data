The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `sb`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, or `sa`. The only change is that `sb` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` has the new element `i` appended to it; `sb` has the new element `i` appended to it.**
