Output State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y` and two newly appended integer values of `y`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the next element in the list `b`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` (which is the next element in the list `b`) has been appended to the list `b_values` again, making it contain the integer value of `y` twice now. All other variables retain their initial values.
