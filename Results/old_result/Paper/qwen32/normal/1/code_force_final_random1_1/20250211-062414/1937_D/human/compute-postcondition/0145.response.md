Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `i - 3` if `l = 1`, `2i - 7` if `l = 2`, `3i - 12` if `l = 3`. If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `(B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `B[r]` (which could be `0`, `1`, or `3` depending on the initial value of `r`).**
