Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. Let's analyze why:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b`, but it incorrectly modifies the string `s` (which should be `b`) in place and uses an incorrect logic for replacing characters.
2. The logic inside the loop is flawed. It tries to replace characters in `s` with characters from `unique_chars` in reverse order, but it does not correctly map the characters back to their original positions.
3. The `replace` method is used incorrectly because it replaces all occurrences of a character at once, which can lead to incorrect results if there are duplicate characters in the string.
4. The `unique_chars` list is modified inside the loop, which can cause unexpected behavior and incorrect mappings.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

In this corrected version:
- We create a set of unique characters from `s` and sort them to get `unique_chars`.
- We create a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character.
- We then construct the decoded string by replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding value in the `mapping` dictionary.
