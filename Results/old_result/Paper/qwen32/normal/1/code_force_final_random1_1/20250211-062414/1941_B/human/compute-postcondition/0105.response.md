The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` decrements the value of `a[i + 2]` by `opNum`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `a[i]` is 0.
- `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`.
- `stop` remains unchanged.

After executing the code, the new state is:
- `a[i + 2]` is now `a[i + 2] - opNum`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 3, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `stop` remains unchanged.**
