Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `x` is at least 1, `n` and `y` are the values returned by `R()`, `y` is updated to `y - 2*c`, `l` is a sorted list returned by `R()` with at least two elements, including the additional element `n + l[0]`, `val` is a non-empty sorted list of `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, sorted first by evenness and then by value, `cons` are calculated based on the conditions involving `y` and `c`, `i` is the next element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`. If `y < c`, `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
