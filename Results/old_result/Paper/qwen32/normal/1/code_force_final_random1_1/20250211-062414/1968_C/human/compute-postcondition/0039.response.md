Output State: **After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 plus the sum of the elements in `x` up to `x[i-1]`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the variable `t` still represents the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the length of the list `a`, which starts with 1000, and each subsequent element in `a` is calculated by adding the corresponding element in `x` to the previous element in `a`. The variable `i` is used within each iteration to compute the cumulative sums but does not persist outside of the loop.
