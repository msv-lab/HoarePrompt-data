Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \); `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `d2[n - 1]` has been set to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
