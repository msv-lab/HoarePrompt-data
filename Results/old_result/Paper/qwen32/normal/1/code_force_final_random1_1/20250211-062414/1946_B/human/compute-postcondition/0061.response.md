The given code snippet appends a new element to the list `suf`. The new element is calculated as the sum of the current last element of `suf` (which is `suf[i]`) and the `i`-th element of the list `l`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `suf`. The new state of `suf` will include an additional element which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, suf[i] + l[i]]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; if `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`**

In simpler terms, the list `suf` now contains an additional element which is the sum of its previous last element and the corresponding element from the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
