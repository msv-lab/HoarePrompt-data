The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `k`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `best`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, `i` is the previous value of `n`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<'**.
