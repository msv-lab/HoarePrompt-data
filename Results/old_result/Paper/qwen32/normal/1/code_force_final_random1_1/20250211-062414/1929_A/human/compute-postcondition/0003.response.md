The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the original list `a` is overwritten with the new list of integers from the input.

Given the initial state, `a` was already defined as a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, `a` is updated to reflect the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100); `a` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `ntest` must be greater than 0.**
