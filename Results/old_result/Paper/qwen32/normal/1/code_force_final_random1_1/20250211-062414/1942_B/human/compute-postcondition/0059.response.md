To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined and used within the context of the code.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from the end of `ar` to the beginning.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop execution.

### Understanding the Calculation of `res`:
1. **Initialization**: `res` is initialized as an empty list.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each element in `ar` starting from the last element to the first:
   - Calculate `mex - ar[i]` where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet encountered in the form `mex - ar[j]` for any `j` already processed.
   - Append this result to `res`.

### Determining `mex`:
- `mex` starts at 0 and increments until it finds a value that hasn't been encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` for any `i` already processed.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume `ar = [3, 1, 2]` for simplicity:
- Start with `mex = 0`.
- Process `ar[2] = 2`:
  - `mex - ar[2] = 0 - 2 = -2` (not valid since `mex` must be non-negative).
  - Increment `mex` to 1.
  - `mex - ar[2] = 1 - 2 = -1` (still not valid).
  - Increment `mex` to 2.
  - `mex - ar[2] = 2 - 2 = 0` (valid, add to `res`).
- Process `ar[1] = 1`:
  - `mex - ar[1] = 2 - 1 = 1` (valid, add to `res`).
- Process `ar[0] = 3`:
  - `mex - ar[0] = 2 - 3 = -1` (not valid).
  - Increment `mex` to 3.
  - `mex - ar[0] = 3 - 3 = 0` (already encountered, increment `mex`).
  - Increment `mex` to 4.
  - `mex - ar[0] = 4 - 3 = 1` (already encountered, increment `mex`).
  - Increment `mex` to 5.
  - `mex - ar[0] = 5 - 3 = 2` (valid, add to `res`).

So, `res` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.

### General Case:
Given the above process, the output will be a space-separated string of integers where each integer is the result of `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from the end of `ar` to the beginning, ensuring `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet encountered in the form `mex - ar[j]` for any `j` already processed.

### Final Output:
Output: **a space-separated string of integers representing `res` where each integer is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from the end of `ar` to the beginning, ensuring `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet encountered in the form `mex - ar[j]` for any `j` already processed**.
