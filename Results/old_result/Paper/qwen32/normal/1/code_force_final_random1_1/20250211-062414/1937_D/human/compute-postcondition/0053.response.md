The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Since `x` is given as `20`, the list `B` will now include `20` as its last element. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `x` is `20`, `B` is `[20]`**.
