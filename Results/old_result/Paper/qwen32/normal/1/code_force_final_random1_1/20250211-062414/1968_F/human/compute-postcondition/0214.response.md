The code snippet `l = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `l` to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `data` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`.
- `results` contains `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, and additionally contains `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` contains `'NO'`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `q` must be greater than 0 and is now `q - 1`.
- `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`.
- `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`.
- `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs.
- `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`.
- `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`.
- `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`.
- `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`.
- `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

After executing the line `l = int(data[idx])`, the new value of `l` is `int(data[idx])`. This change affects `x` because `x` depends on `l`. The new value of `x` will be `pf[r] ^ pf[int(data[idx]) - 1]`.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` contains `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, and additionally contains `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` contains `'NO'`, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0 and is now `q - 1`, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[int(data[idx]) - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[int(data[idx]) - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[int(data[idx]) - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
