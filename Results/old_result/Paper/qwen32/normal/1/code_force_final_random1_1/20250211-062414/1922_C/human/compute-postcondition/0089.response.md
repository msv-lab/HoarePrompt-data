Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` is at least `3`
- `l` remains the same list of integers
- `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`
- `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1`
- If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` and `d2[n - 3]` set to `1 + d2[n - 2]`. Otherwise, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1` and `d2[n - 3]` set to `l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]`

Code Snippet:
```python
d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
```

Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`. Therefore, the code sets `d2[n - 2]` to `1 + d2[n - 1]`.

Given that `d2[n - 1]` is initially `1`, `d2[n - 2]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.

Thus, the updated state of `d2` is:
- `d2[n - 1]` remains `1`
- `d2[n - 2]` is now `2`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least `3`, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its value at key `n - 2` set to `2`.**
