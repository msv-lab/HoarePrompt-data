The code snippet provided is simply reassigning the value of `feat[2]` to the variable `a`. Since `a` was already defined as `feat[2]` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `a`.

Therefore, no changes occur to the values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list that may include the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `x + 1`**
