The given code snippet only contains the line `current_year = next_year`. This line assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. No other variables are modified or used in this line of code.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `current_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`; `ai` is the second element in `a`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than `old_next_year`.**
