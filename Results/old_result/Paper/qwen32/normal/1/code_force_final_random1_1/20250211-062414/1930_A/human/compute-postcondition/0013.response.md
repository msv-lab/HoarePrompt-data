Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is updated to the value of the input integer. The values of `t`, `l`, and `score` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
