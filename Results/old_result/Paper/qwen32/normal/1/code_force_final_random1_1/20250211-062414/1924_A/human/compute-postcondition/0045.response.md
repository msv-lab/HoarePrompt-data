The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the current value of `i`.

Given that `i` is initially 1, `tmp` will be set to `'b'` because the ASCII value of `'a'` is 97, and adding 1 results in 98, which corresponds to `'b'`.

No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1, `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0, `m` remains the integer provided as input, `s` remains the string provided as input, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set if the `i`-th bit was not set, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters, `tmp` is `'b'`**.
