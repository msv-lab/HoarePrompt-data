The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the value of `winner`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged. The function `func_1(a, b)` has already been called, and its return value is stored in `winner`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.
