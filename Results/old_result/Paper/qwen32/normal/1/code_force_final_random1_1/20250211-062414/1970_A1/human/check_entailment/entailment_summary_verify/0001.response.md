Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to ensure that the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to perform a balanced shuffle on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the prefix balance for each character and sorting the characters based on these balances and positions.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function is intended to be a comparator for sorting, but it is not used in the provided code. Instead, a lambda function is used for sorting in `func_2`. This function seems redundant and could be removed without affecting the functionality.
   - **Function `func_2`:** This is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle.
     - **Initialization:** An empty list `balance_info` is initialized to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - **Prefix Balance Calculation:** As the function iterates through the string `s`, it calculates the prefix balance for each character and appends a `BalanceInfo` object containing the balance, position, and character to `balance_info`.
     - **Sorting:** The list `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function. The sorting key is a tuple `(x.balance, -x.position)`, which ensures that characters are sorted by their balance in ascending order and by their position in descending order when balances are equal.
     - **Result Construction:** The final result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and printing the result.

3. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_2`. It mentions that the function takes a balanced parentheses sequence, computes prefix balances, sorts the characters based on these balances and positions, and constructs the final shuffled sequence.

4. **Verification Against the Problem Statement:**
   - The code correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character.
   - The sorting criteria match the problem statement: sorting by prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
   - The final sequence constructed from the sorted characters is printed, which aligns with the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues or logical errors in the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
