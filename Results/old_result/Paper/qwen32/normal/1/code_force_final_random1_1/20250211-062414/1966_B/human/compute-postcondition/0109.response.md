To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

Given:
- The loop condition is `for j in range(m - 1)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1.
- `m` is at least 2.

From the loop condition, we know that `j` ranges from 0 to `m-2` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value within this range.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `m` does not need to be changed as it defines the upper limit of the range.

Given that `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `j` at the start of the next iteration should be `j + 2`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `j + 2`, `tc` is incremented by `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the character at position `j + 2` in the first string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 3` in the first string of `gr`, or the character at position `j + 2` in the last string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 3` in the last string of `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
