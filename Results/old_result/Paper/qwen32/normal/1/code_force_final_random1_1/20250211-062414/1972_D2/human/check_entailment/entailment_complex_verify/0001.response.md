### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: Handles a single test case.
- `func_2()`: Reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Detailed Examination of `func_1()`:
- **Initialization**: `x` is initialized to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- **Reading Input**: `n` and `m` are read from the input.
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over `x` with the condition `x * x <= n`.
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates over `y` with the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- **Condition Check**: Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- **Count Increment**: Increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Pair Generation**:
   - The program uses `x` and `y` as potential candidates for `a` and `b`, but it does not directly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` do not ensure that all pairs \((a, b)\) are considered.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Condition**:
   - The program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and then increments `cnt` based on a formula that does not directly verify the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

3. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The increment logic `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This can be done using nested loops for `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic used to generate pairs and count valid pairs is flawed, and the conditions checked do not align with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
