Postcondition: **`final` is a list containing `elem` three times if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` was true, or `final` is a list containing `elem` twice if `abs(pk - elem) != mini`. `n` is greater than 1, `t` has been decremented by 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least two elements, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `elem` is the third element in `lst`.**
