The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `cur`. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the string provided by the input, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.**
