Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \)
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[4] - l[3] < l[5] - l[4]`, then `d2[4]` is `1 + d2[5]`. Otherwise, `d2[4]` is `l[4] - l[3]`
- `i` is 3

Code Snippet:
```python
d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code updates the value of `d2[i]` where `i` is 3.
- The new value of `d2[3]` is calculated as `l[3] - l[2] + d2[4]`.

Output State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \)
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[4] - l[3] < l[5] - l[4]`, then `d2[4]` is `1 + d2[5]`. Otherwise, `d2[4]` is `l[4] - l[3]`. Additionally, `d2[3]` is now `l[3] - l[2] + d2[4]`.
- `i` is 3 (unchanged)

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \); `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where if `l[4] - l[3] < l[5] - l[4]`, then `d2[4]` is `1 + d2[5]`. Otherwise, `d2[4]` is `l[4] - l[3]`. Additionally, `d2[3]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d2[4]`; `i` is 3.**
