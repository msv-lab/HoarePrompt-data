Given the initial conditions and the operation performed on `y`, let's determine the new state.

Initial State:
- `i` is `x`
- `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 4 * y + gap` if `y < gap // 2` initially, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 2 * y + gap`
- `odd` contains at least two odd gaps greater than 1 and is sorted
- `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted
- `gap` is the next element in `odd`
- `y` is `0` if `y < gap // 2` initially

The operation performed:
```
y -= gap // 2
```

Impact of the operation:
- The value of `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

Since `y` was initially `0` if `y < gap // 2`, after the operation, `y` becomes `-gap // 2` if `y < gap // 2` initially.

Output State: **`i` is `x`; `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 4 * y + gap` if `y < gap // 2` initially, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 2 * y + gap`; `odd` contains at least two odd gaps greater than 1 and is sorted; `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next element in `odd`; `y` is `-gap // 2` if `y < gap // 2` initially, otherwise `y` is `y - gap // 2`.**

In simpler terms:
- `i` remains `x`.
- The increment rule for `ans` remains the same.
- `odd` and `even` lists remain unchanged.
- `gap` remains the same.
- `y` is now `-gap // 2` if it was less than `gap // 2` initially, otherwise it is reduced by `gap // 2`.
