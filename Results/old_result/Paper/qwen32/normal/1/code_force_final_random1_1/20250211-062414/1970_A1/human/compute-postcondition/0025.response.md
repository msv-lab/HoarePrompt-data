Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters of `s` based on their balance values and positions. The balance value represents the net number of opening parentheses encountered up to that point in the string. Characters with lower balance values come first, and for ties, characters appearing later in the original string come first.**
