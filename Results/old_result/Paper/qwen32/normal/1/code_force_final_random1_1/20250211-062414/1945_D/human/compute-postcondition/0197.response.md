Output State: **`custo` is 110, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables `custo`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `custos`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
