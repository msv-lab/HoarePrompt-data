Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and must contain at least one element, `count_num` is 0, and `i` is an integer such that `start <= i <= end`**
