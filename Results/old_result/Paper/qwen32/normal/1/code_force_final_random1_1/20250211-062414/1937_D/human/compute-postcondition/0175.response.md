To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet with respect to the initial state provided.

Given:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 1
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
- If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `3 - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `A[l - 1]`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `i` is 1
- `idx_A` is `[3, 4, 5]`
- `r` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a` or the initial value of `b` without more information about `r`. However, we can still express the updated value of `b` in terms of `b`, `i`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `r`.

Let's assume `l` is also defined somewhere in the context, but since it's not provided, we'll keep it as a variable. The value of `b` before the operation could be one of two possibilities based on the condition involving `l` and `r`:
- If `l - r > 0`, `b` was initially `3 - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`
- Otherwise, `b` was initially `A[l - 1]`

After executing the line `b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, the new value of `b` will be:
- If `l - r > 0`, `b` becomes `3 - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`
- Otherwise, `b` becomes `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we cannot simplify further. We can only express the new value of `b` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`**
