Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500; `count` is 1; `flag` is False; `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2; `j` is 1; if the character at position `j` in `s` is different from the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` is 2 and `flag` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; otherwise, `count` remains 1 and `flag` remains False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3; `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, `count` is increased by 1. Additionally, if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3; `j` is 3; If `s[2] != s[3]`, `count` is increased by 1. If `s[2] == '0' and s[3] == '1'`, then `flag` is True.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
