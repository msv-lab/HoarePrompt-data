### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic used in `func_14()` for generating the sequence `a` based on the problem description.

#### Case 1: \( k == 1 \)
- **Sequence Construction**: The sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 (`2^i` for \( i \geq 2 \)).
- **Validation**:
  - **No Subsequence Sum Equals 1**: Since the smallest element in the sequence is 2, no subsequence can sum to 1.
  - **All Sums from 2 to \( n \)**: The sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum from 2 to \( n \) through combinations. For example, if \( n = 6 \), the sequence `[2, 3, 4]` can form sums 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

#### Case 2: \( k > 1 \)
- **Sequence Construction**:
  - Start with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k-1 \).
  - Add \( k-1 - \text{sum(ans)} \) to ensure the sum of the initial part is less than \( k \).
  - Include \( k+1 \) and \( 2k+1 \) to avoid forming \( k \) while still allowing sums close to \( k \).
  - Continue with powers of 2 beyond the length of the binary representation of \( k \).

- **Validation**:
  - **No Subsequence Sum Equals \( k \)**: The inclusion of \( k+1 \) and \( 2k+1 \) ensures that no combination of the sequence can sum exactly to \( k \).
  - **All Sums from 1 to \( n \) Except \( k \)**: The sequence includes powers of 2 and additional elements that allow forming all sums from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \). For example, if \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \), the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` can form sums 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 but not 7.

### Verification Against Edge Cases

1. **Small Values of \( n \) and \( k \)**:
   - **\( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)**: Sequence `[1]` allows sums of 1 but not 2.
   - **\( n = 6 \), \( k = 1 \)**: Sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` allows sums from 2 to 6 but not 1.
   - **\( n = 8 \), \( k = 8 \)**: Sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` allows sums from 1 to 7 but not 8.
   - **\( n = 9 \), \( k = 3 \)**: Sequence `[7, 1, 4, 1]` allows sums from 1 to 9 except 3.
   - **\( n = 10 \), \( k = 7 \)**: Sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` allows sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

2. **Larger Values of \( n \) and \( k \)**:
   - The logic for generating the sequence should handle larger values of \( n \) and \( k \) correctly by ensuring that the sum of any subset of the sequence does not equal \( k \) while allowing all other sums up to \( n \).

### Annotations Validation

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code match the logic described in the program. They correctly describe the state of the program at key points and the transformations applied to the sequence `a` based on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly constructs sequences that meet the problem requirements for all provided examples and edge scenarios. The logic for generating the sequence ensures that the conditions are met for both small and large values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct.
