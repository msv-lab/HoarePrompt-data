To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly computes the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for any given encoded value \( n \) within the specified range (3 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 78).

Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Alphabet Mapping**: The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map letters to their respective positions (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25).

2. **Logic for Different Ranges of \( n \)**:
   - **If \( n > 52 \)**: The program calculates the first letter as `alphabet[n - 53]` and appends 'zz'. This means the sum of the positions of the letters is \( n = (position\_of\_first\_letter + 1) + 26 + 26 \). Simplifying, we get \( position\_of\_first\_letter = n - 53 \).
     - For example, if \( n = 70 \), the first letter would be `alphabet[70 - 53] = alphabet[17] = 'r'`, and the word would be 'rzz'.
   - **If \( 26 < n \leq 52 \)**: The program calculates the first letter as 'a', the second letter as `alphabet[n - 28]`, and appends 'z'. This means the sum of the positions of the letters is \( n = 1 + (position\_of\_second\_letter + 1) + 26 \). Simplifying, we get \( position\_of\_second\_letter = n - 28 \).
     - For example, if \( n = 55 \), the second letter would be `alphabet[55 - 28] = alphabet[27 - 1] = alphabet[26 - 1] = alphabet[25] = 'z'`, and the word would be 'azz'. However, since the condition is \( 26 < n \leq 52 \), this example should not fall into this category.
   - **If \( n \leq 26 \)**: The program calculates the word as 'aa' followed by `alphabet[n - 3]`. This means the sum of the positions of the letters is \( n = 1 + 1 + (position\_of\_third\_letter + 1) \). Simplifying, we get \( position\_of\_third\_letter = n - 3 \).
     - For example, if \( n = 3 \), the third letter would be `alphabet[3 - 3] = alphabet[0] = 'a'`, and the word would be 'aaa'.

Let's check if these calculations align with the examples provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1**: \( n = 24 \)
  - Since \( 26 > 24 \geq 3 \), the word is calculated as 'aa' + `alphabet[24 - 3] = alphabet[21] = 'v'`.
  - Result: 'aav' (Correct)

- **Example 2**: \( n = 70 \)
  - Since \( 70 > 52 \), the word is calculated as `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[17] + 'zz' = 'rzz'`.
  - Result: 'rzz' (Correct)

- **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \)
  - Since \( n \leq 26 \), the word is calculated as 'aa' + `alphabet[3 - 3] = alphabet[0] = 'a'`.
  - Result: 'aaa' (Correct)

- **Example 4**: \( n = 55 \)
  - Since \( 52 < 55 \leq 78 \), the word is calculated as `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[2] + 'zz' = 'czz'`.
  - Result: 'czz' (Correct)

- **Example 5**: \( n = 48 \)
  - Since \( 52 > 48 > 26 \), the word is calculated as 'a' + `alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z' = 'auz'`.
  - Result: 'auz' (Correct)

Based on the analysis, the program correctly computes the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for the given encoded values.
