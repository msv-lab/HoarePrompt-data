To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet involves a dictionary `d1` and two indices `x` and `y`.
- Since `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we need to infer its structure based on the context.
- The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` suggests that `d1` is a dictionary where keys are integers (possibly including `x` and `y`), and values are numbers that can be subtracted from each other.

### Given Information:
- `y > x`: This means `y` is a key in `d1` that comes after `x` in terms of value if `d1` is indexed sequentially.
- No specific values for `d1`, `x`, or `y` are provided, so we cannot compute an exact numerical result.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the difference between the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a dictionary, y is an integer greater than x, and both are keys in d1)**
