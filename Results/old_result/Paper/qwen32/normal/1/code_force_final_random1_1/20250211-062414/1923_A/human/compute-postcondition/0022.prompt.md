Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_i` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, there is at least one `a_i` equal to 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = ''.join(input('').split())
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new integer read from input, `arr` is a string consisting of `n` characters where each character is either '0' or '1', with at least one character equal to '1', `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, which is equivalent to `n - x - 1`; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 1, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
