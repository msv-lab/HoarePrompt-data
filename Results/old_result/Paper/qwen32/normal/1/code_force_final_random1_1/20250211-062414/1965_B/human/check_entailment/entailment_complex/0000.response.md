### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify whether the generated sequence for each test case meets the problem's requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to k**: The sequence should not have any subsequence whose sum equals `k`.
2. **All Subsequences Sum to Values from 1 to n (excluding k)**: For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` except `k`, there should exist a subsequence of the sequence whose sum equals `v`.

Let's analyze the function `func_14` which is responsible for generating the sequence for each test case.

#### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)
- If \( n = 2 \), the sequence is `[2]`. This sequence does not include `1` and includes `2`, meeting the requirements.
- For \( n > 2 \), the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums from `2` to `n` can be formed, and `1` cannot be formed.

#### Case 2: \( k > 1 \)
- The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
- It then includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
- Finally, it continues with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

This construction ensures:
- All sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed.
- No subsequence sums to `k`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)
   - Sequence: `[2]`
   - No subsequence sums to `2`.
   - Only possible sum is `2`, which is excluded.

2. **Test Case 2**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 1 \)
   - Sequence: `[2, 3, 4]`
   - Possible sums: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`.
   - `1` cannot be formed.

3. **Test Case 3**: \( n = 8 \), \( k = 8 \)
   - Sequence: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - Possible sums: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`.
   - `8` cannot be formed.

4. **Test Case 4**: \( n = 9 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - Sequence: `[2, 1, 4, 1]`
   - Possible sums: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` except `3`.
   - `3` cannot be formed.

5. **Test Case 5**: \( n = 10 \), \( k = 7 \)
   - Sequence: `[1, 2, 8, 3]`
   - Possible sums: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10` except `7`.
   - `7` cannot be formed.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_14` correctly constructs sequences that satisfy the problem's conditions for all given test cases. Therefore, the entire program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
