Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: This variable is set to `t - 1`, but since `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it does not affect our output.
   - `n`, `k`, `q`: These are integers read from the input.
   - `a`: A list starting with `0` followed by integers read from the input.
   - `b`: A list starting with `0` followed by integers read from the input.
   - `ad`: A list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `a` (starting with `0`).
   - `bd`: A list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `b` (starting with `0`).
   - `i`: Set to `1`.
   - `v`: A list where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd` (starting with `0`).
   - `l`: Set to `q`.
   - `m`: Set to `0`.
   - `ql`: An integer read from the input.
   - `s`: The index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

2. **Key Points:**
   - `a` and `b` are lists starting with `0` followed by additional integers.
   - `ad` and `bd` are the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b` respectively.
   - `v` contains the ratios of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`.
   - `ql` is an integer that matches an element in `a` at index `s`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.
- Since `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, `s` is the position of `ql` in the list `a`.
- Therefore, `b[s]` is the element in list `b` at the same index `s` where `ql` is located in list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the element in list `b` at the index `s`, where `s` is the position of `ql` in list `a`.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index of ql in the list a)**
