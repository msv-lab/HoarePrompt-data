To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand how the variables and objects are defined and manipulated:

1. **`b_values`**: This is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
2. **`ans`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
3. **`curr`**: This variable represents the count of elements in the last sliding window of size `m` from the list `a` that are also in `b` and whose counts in `cnt_b` were non-negative after decrementing.
4. **`cnt_b`**: This is a counter (likely a dictionary or similar structure) that keeps track of the counts of elements in `b`. Its counts are decremented for each occurrence of elements from `a` that are in `b` during the loop.
5. **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`**: These remain unchanged throughout the process.

Given this setup, the `ans` variable is incremented whenever the number of elements in the current sliding window of size `m` from `a` that are also in `b` (and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`) meets or exceeds the threshold `k`.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the logic described above.

### Explanation:
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the number of times the condition `curr >= k` is met during the sliding window iterations over the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the count of elements in the sliding window of size m from a that are also in b and have non-negative counts in cnt_b is greater than or equal to k)**
