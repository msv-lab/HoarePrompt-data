Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was initially non-negative. Otherwise, `ans`, `curr`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 1 otherwise. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.**
