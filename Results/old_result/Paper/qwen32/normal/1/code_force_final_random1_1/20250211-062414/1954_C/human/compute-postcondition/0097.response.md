Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged. `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `b` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `new` will have `max(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the point where `a[i] != b[i]`. `new2` will have `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the point where `a[i] != b[i]`. The number of remaining iterations is zero because the loop has completed all its iterations. `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or `n` if all elements are equal. Additionally, `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, indicating that there is at least one index where `a[i] != b[i]`.**
