The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

Given that `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the decrement. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 more than its current value.

State: **`year` is the result of the loop processing all elements in `a` according to the rule `year += year % ai or ai`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.**
