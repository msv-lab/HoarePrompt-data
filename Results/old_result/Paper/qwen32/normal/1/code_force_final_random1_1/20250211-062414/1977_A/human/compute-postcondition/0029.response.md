In the given initial state, several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`) are described, but the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

However, none of these variables affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement only outputs the literal string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
