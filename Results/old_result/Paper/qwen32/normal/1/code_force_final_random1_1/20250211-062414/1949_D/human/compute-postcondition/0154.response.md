The code snippet `nx += 'F'` concatenates the string `'F'` to the existing value of `nx`. Given that the initial state specifies `nx` as an empty string `''`, after executing the code, `nx` will become `'F'`.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sa`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is 'F', `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`.**
