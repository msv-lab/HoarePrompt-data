To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `new` is constructed such that it contains `max(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point.
- `new2` is constructed similarly but with `min(a[i], b[i])` instead of `max(a[i], b[i])`.
- The variable `i` indicates the current index being processed. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, there are remaining iterations. If `i` equals the length of `a`, all iterations are complete.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```
This line of code joins the string representations of each element in the list `new` into a single string and prints it.

### Determining the Output:
1. **List `new` Construction**: 
   - For each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, `new[i]` will be `max(a[i], b[i])`.
   - For indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the length of the shortest list between `a` and `b`, `new[i]` will be `None`.

2. **String Conversion and Joining**:
   - Each element in `new` is converted to a string.
   - These string representations are then joined together without any separator.

### Example Scenario:
Let's assume `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b = [1, 2, 0, 4]` for concreteness.
- At index `0`, `a[0] == b[0]` so `new[0] = max(1, 1) = 1`.
- At index `1`, `a[1] == b[1]` so `new[1] = max(2, 2) = 2`.
- At index `2`, `a[2] != b[2]` so `new[2] = None`.
- At index `3`, `a[3] == b[3]` so `new[3] = max(4, 4) = 4`.

Thus, `new = [1, 2, None, 4]`.

Converting each element to a string and joining them results in `'12None4'`.

### General Case:
In the general case, `new` will contain a sequence of numbers followed by `None` values if `a[i] != b[i]` or if the lists differ in length.

### Final Output:
Given the construction rules for `new`, the output will be a string representation of the elements in `new` joined together.

Output: **12None4 (where the exact sequence depends on the values of `a` and `b`)**

However, since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of the construction rules:

Output: **a sequence of numbers followed by `None` values where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond the length of the shortest list between `a` and `b`**
