To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned for completeness).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Value of `X`:**
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2. This operation discards any remainder and results in the largest whole number less than or equal to the result of the division.

2. **Calculate the Expression `X * C + B`:**
   - First, multiply `X` by `C`.
   - Then, add `B` to the result of the multiplication.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   - Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input, their specific values are not provided. Therefore, we'll express the final result in terms of these variables.

### Final Expression:
The expression `X * C + B` translates to `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Output:
Based on the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers read from the input)**
