The given code snippet simply increments the variable `ans` by 1. None of the other variables (`b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the increment of `ans`.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[4 + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[4 + m]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[4 + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[4 + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` is updated to the third integer from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is 4. `ans` is incremented by 1.**
