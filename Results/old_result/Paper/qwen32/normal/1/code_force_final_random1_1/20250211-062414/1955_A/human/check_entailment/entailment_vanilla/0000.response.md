Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts with a promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations:
1. If the price for two yogurts (`b`) is greater than or equal to twice the price of one yogurt (`2 * a`), it's always cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
2. If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs.
3. If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy `(n // 2)` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

- `A` corresponds to `n` (number of yogurts).
- `B` corresponds to `a` (price of one yogurt).
- `C` corresponds to `b` (price of two yogurts).

#### Case 1: `if B * 2 < C`
This condition checks if it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually rather than in pairs. If true, it prints `A * B`, which is the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the individual price.

#### Case 2: `elif A % 2 == 0`
This condition checks if `n` is even. If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs.

#### Case 3: `else`
If `n` is odd, this block executes. It calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`). Thus, it prints `X * C + B`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all scenarios:
- Buying yogurts individually when the promotion price is not beneficial.
- Buying all yogurts in pairs when `n` is even.
- Buying `(n // 2)` pairs and one additional yogurt when `n` is odd.

Thus, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
