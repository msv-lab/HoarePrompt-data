The code snippet `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` was previously defined as `i + x`, which means `i` was already incremented by `x` before this line. After executing `i += x`, `i` will be incremented by `x` again.

Thus, the new value of `i` will be its previous value plus `x` again, effectively making it `i + 2*x`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is [0, i], `c` is [0, j], `i` is `i + 2*x`, `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
