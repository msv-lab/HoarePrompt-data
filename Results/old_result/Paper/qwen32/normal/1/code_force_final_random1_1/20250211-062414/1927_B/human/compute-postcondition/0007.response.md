The given code snippet appends a character from the list `alp` to the list `ans`. The character appended is determined by the count of the current element in the reversed array `rev_array` starting from index `j`, minus one.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])` counts the occurrences of the element at index `j` in the sublist of `rev_array` starting from `j`.
- Subtracting 1 from this count gives an index into the list `alp`.
- The character at this index in `alp` is appended to the list `ans`.

Since `alp` contains lowercase English alphabet characters (from 'a' to 'z'), the value being appended to `ans` will be a lowercase letter.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l` must be greater than 0.
- `array` is a list of integers.
- `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters.
- `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.
- `ans` is an empty list.

After executing the code snippet, `ans` will contain one additional element, which is a lowercase letter from `alp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than 0; `array` is a list of integers; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing one additional lowercase letter from `alp`.**
