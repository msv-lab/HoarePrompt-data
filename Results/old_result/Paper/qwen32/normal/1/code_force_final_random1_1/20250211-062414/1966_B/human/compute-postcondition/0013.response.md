Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 'YES', and the first character of the first line (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the last character of the last line (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`); `impossible` is True.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is the introduction of the variable `impossible` which is set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
