Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a` with `cnt_b[b[i]]` incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` remains 0; `cnt_b` has the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1 (making `curr` 2 if it was initially 1) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 2; otherwise, `curr` remains 0; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is either 0, 1, or 3; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two integers from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to the third integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative after the decrement, `curr` is updated to 1; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
