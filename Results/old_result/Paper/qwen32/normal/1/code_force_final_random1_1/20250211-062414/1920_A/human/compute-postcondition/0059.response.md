To determine the output state, let's analyze the given return statement:

```
return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
```

We know:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
- `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`.
- `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`.
- `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`.
- `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
- `start` is less than or equal to `end`.

The return statement calculates the difference between the range from `start` to `end` inclusive (`end - start + 1`) and subtracts `count_num` from it. However, if `end - start + 1` is less than `count_num`, the function returns 0.

Given these conditions, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The program returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.**

This means the program calculates the total number of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive and subtracts the count of those integers that are also in the list `num` and within the range `[start, end]`. If the remaining count is negative or zero, it simply returns 0.
