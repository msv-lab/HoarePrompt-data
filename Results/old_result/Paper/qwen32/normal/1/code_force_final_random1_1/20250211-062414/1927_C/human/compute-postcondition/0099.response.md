Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 3; `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
