The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the overall state of the program except for the control flow, which moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, no changes are made to any of the variables. The loop simply moves to its next iteration without altering the values of `data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, or `it2`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for `q` which has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * (q - 1) + 10`, `results` contains `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, and additionally contains `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, `results` contains `'NO'`, `results` now also contains `'YES'`, `n` remains the same, `q` is `q - 1`, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
