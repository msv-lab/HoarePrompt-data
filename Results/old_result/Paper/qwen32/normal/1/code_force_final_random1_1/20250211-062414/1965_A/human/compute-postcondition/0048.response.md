To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `j` iterates over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(lis)`. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `lis` must be greater than 1. This is because the range function `range(1, len(lis))` will produce no values if `len(lis)` is 1 or less.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `test` is True.
- `j` is equal to the length of `lis`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `j`, but since `j` is determined by the range function and the length of `lis`, we need to adjust `lis` to ensure that its length is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `lis` contains more than one unique integer.

Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, `test` is True, `j` is equal to the length of `lis`**
