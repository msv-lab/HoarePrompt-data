Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is an empty list, `n` remains the same, `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`, `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` remains the list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `final` is a list containing `[elem]` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` remains an empty list. `n` remains the same, `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`, `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least one element, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `final` is a list containing `[elem]` if the original length of `final` was 0 and `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` contains the original elements plus `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `abs(pk - elem) != mini`, `final` remains unchanged. `n` remains the same, `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`, `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least one element, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `elem` is the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is a list containing its original elements plus `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`; otherwise, `final` remains unchanged. `n` remains the same, `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`, `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least one element, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, and `elem` is `next_elem`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
