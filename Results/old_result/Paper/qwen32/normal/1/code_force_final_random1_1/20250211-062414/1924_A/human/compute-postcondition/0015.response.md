The given code snippet attempts to concatenate the variable `ss` to the variable `ans`. However, the variable `ss` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming there might be a typo and `ss` was intended to be `s` (the non-empty string), the code would concatenate the string `s` to `ans`.

Given this assumption, here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `s`, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[cur]) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially an empty string. After executing the line `ans += s`, `ans` now holds the value of the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
