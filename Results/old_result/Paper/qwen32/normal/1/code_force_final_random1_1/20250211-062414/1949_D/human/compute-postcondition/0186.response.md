The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments the value of `nx` by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `j` is `j + 1` in the initial state, the value used from the `xx` array is `xx[i][j]` because `j - 1` effectively undoes the increment.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is `j + 1`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable that changes its value is `nx`, which increases by `xx[i][j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is `nx + xx[i][j]`**.
