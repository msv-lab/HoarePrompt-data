Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1. Otherwise, it is not the case that `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, or at least one of `a` or `b` is equal to 1.**
