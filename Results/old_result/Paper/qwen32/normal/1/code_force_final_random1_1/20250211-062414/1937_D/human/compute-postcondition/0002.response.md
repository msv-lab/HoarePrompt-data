The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `idx_A`. This action does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `A`. The variable `s` remains a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` remains the length of `s`, and `A` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.**
