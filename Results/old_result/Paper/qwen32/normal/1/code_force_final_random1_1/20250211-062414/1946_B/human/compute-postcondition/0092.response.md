Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`
- `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `j + n`
- `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

Code Snippet:
```python
sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

Output State:
- All other variables remain unchanged except for `sm`.
- `sm` is now equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point; `i` is 2; `j` is `j + n`; `sm` is equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.**
