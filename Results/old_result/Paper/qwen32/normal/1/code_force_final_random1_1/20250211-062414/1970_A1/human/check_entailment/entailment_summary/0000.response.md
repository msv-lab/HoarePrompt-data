### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the functionality of the provided code and compare it with the requirements.

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The class `BalanceInfo` is used to store three attributes: `balance`, `position`, and `character`. This class will help us keep track of the balance at each position in the string and the corresponding character.

2. **Comparison Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is used as a comparator for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their `balance` attribute. If the balances are different, it sorts them in ascending order of balance. If the balances are the same, it sorts them in descending order of position (which means characters appearing later in the string come first).

3. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The main function `func_2` performs the following steps:
     - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It iterates through the input string `s`, updating the `balance` as it encounters opening and closing parentheses.
     - For each character, it creates a `BalanceInfo` object with the current balance, position, and character, and appends it to the `balance_info` list.
     - After constructing the list, it sorts it using the comparator function `func_1`.
     - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly calculated as the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses up to each position in the string.
- **Sorting Criteria**: The sorting criteria match the problem description. Characters are sorted first by their balance in ascending order, and for ties, by their position in descending order.
- **Result Construction**: The result string is correctly constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.

Given that all parts of the program correctly implement the steps required by the problem statement, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
