### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if it correctly addresses the requirements.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Chessboard Setup**: We have an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns placing rooks.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer mirrors it by placing a black rook.
   - If you place a rook on the diagonal (\( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column).
3. **Objective**: Determine the number of distinct final configurations after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and rules above.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Precomputation**:
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the number of configurations for different board sizes up to \( 300,000 \).
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This formula seems to account for the placement of rooks in a way that respects the game rules, but let's verify if it matches the problem's logic.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then reads \( k \) pairs of coordinates representing the moves.
   - It calculates the number of invalid rows/columns by adding the row and column indices of each move to a set.
   - The number of valid configurations is determined by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's consider the first example provided:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  4 1
  1 2
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `3`

From the provided code, the computation would be:
- `invalid` set would contain `{1, 2}`.
- Number of invalid rows/columns = 2.
- Valid configurations = `dp[4 - 2] = dp[2] = 3`.

This matches the expected output.

However, the correctness of the formula used in `func_1` needs to be verified against the problem's logic. The formula appears to be derived from combinatorial principles related to non-attacking rook placements, but it's crucial to ensure it aligns with the mirroring rule and the diagonal skip rule.

Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, the provided formula seems to be a valid dynamic programming approach to solve the problem efficiently within the constraints. However, without a rigorous mathematical proof of the formula's correctness, we cannot be absolutely certain.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the provided examples and the logical flow of the program, the solution appears to be correct. However, the correctness of the formula used in `func_1` should ideally be mathematically proven to be fully confident.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True** (assuming the formula in `func_1` is correct based on the problem's requirements).
