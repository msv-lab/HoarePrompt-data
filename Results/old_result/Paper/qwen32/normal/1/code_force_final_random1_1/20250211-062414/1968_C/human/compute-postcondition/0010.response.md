The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` by adding `x[i - 1]` to `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `a[3]` is updated to `a[2] + x[2]`.

- Initially, `a[3]` is 0.
- `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- `x[2]` is the third element of the list `x`.

After the operation, `a[3]` becomes `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the fourth element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 3**.
