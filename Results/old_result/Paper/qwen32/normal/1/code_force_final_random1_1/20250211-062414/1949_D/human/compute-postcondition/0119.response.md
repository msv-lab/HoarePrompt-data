Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` (including `n`), and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[n] == 0` and `b[n] == 0`, then `n` has been appended to `sa`, making the length of `sa` at least the length of `sb` plus one. Otherwise, the lists `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged. `i` is `n`.**
