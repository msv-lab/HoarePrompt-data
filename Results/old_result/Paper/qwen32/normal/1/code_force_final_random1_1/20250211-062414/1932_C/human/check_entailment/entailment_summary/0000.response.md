### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and see if it aligns with the problem statement.

#### Program Overview:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the modulus `m`, the array `a` itself, and the string `s` containing commands.
2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the commands in `s`. Depending on whether the command is 'L' or 'R', it appends either the leftmost or rightmost element of `a` to a new list `b` and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
3. **Calculating Remainders**:
   - After constructing `b`, the function calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking each product modulo `m`.
   - These remainders are collected in a list `ans`, which is then reversed before being returned.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Construction of `b`**: The list `b` is constructed by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. However, this does not reflect the actual state of `a` as elements are removed according to the commands. Instead, it simply records which elements would be removed in what order.
- **Incorrect Calculation of Product**: The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, but this does not match the requirement to calculate the product of the current state of `a` at each step before removing an element.
- **Reversing the Result**: The result is reversed before returning, which is unnecessary and incorrect given the way the product is calculated.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Maintain Current State of `a`**: As commands are processed, the current state of `a` should be maintained, and the product of its elements should be recalculated after each removal.
- **Calculate Product on-the-Fly**: Instead of constructing `b` and calculating the product afterward, the product should be updated dynamically as elements are removed from `a`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
