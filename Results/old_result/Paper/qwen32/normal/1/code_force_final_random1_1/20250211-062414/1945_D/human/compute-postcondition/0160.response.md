The only object in the loop head is the variable `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` was the last element processed from the list `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `b` to assign to `y`.

State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 elements**
