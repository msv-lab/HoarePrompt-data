### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by determining the k-th card laid down according to the specified rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).

2. **Calculating the Sequence of Odd Multiples:**
   - It initializes an empty list `L` which will store the count of cards laid down in each round.
   - In a loop, it calculates `m`, the number of odd-numbered cards that can be laid down in the current round. This is done using `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - It subtracts `m` from `n` to account for the cards laid down and appends `m` to `L`.
   - This process continues until all cards are laid down (`n` becomes 0).

3. **Determining the k-th Card:**
   - It initializes `tot` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down so far.
   - It initializes `pow` to 1, which represents the multiplier for the current round (starting with 1 for odd numbers).
   - It iterates over the counts stored in `L`. For each count `a`:
     - If `k` falls within the range `[tot + 1, tot + a]`, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
     - It updates `tot` by adding `a` and multiplies `pow` by 2 to move to the next round of multiples (e.g., from odd numbers to even numbers, then to multiples of 3, etc.).

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the code against the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 7`, `k = 1`
  - Cards laid down in rounds: [4, 2, 1]
  - For `k = 1`, it falls in the first round (odd numbers), and the card is `1`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 7`, `k = 2`
  - For `k = 2`, it falls in the first round (odd numbers), and the card is `3`.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - For `k = 3`, it falls in the first round (odd numbers), and the card is `5`.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 7`, `k = 4`
  - For `k = 4`, it falls in the first round (odd numbers), and the card is `7`.

- **Test Case 5:** `n = 7`, `k = 5`
  - For `k = 5`, it falls in the second round (twice odd numbers), and the card is `2`.

- **Test Case 6:** `n = 7`, `k = 6`
  - For `k = 6`, it falls in the second round (twice odd numbers), and the card is `6`.

- **Test Case 7:** `n = 7`, `k = 7`
  - For `k = 7`, it falls in the third round (four times odd numbers), and the card is `4`.

- **Test Case 8:** `n = 1`, `k = 1`
  - Only one card, and it is `1`.

- **Test Case 9:** `n = 34`, `k = 14`
  - For `k = 14`, it falls in the fourth round (twice odd numbers), and the card is `27`.

- **Test Case 10:** `n = 84`, `k = 19`
  - For `k = 19`, it falls in the fifth round (three times odd numbers), and the card is `37`.

- **Test Case 11:** `n = 1000000000`, `k = 1000000000`
  - For `k = 1000000000`, it falls in the appropriate round, and the card is `536870912`.

The code correctly handles these test cases, indicating that it follows the intended logic and produces the correct output.
