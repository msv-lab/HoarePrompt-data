The value of `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`. Given that `n` is an odd integer, `pk` will be a float representing the division of `n` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer and `n` is odd; `s` is the string input provided by the user; `pk` is `n / 2`.**
