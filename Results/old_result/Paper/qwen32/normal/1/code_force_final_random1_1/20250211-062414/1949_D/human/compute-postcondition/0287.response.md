Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 1. If `xx[n][n-1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is concatenated with `xx[n][n-1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is followed by 'S' if `i` or `j` is found in the substring `sb[:n // 4]`, or 'F' if neither `i` nor `j` is found in `sb[:n // 4]`.**
