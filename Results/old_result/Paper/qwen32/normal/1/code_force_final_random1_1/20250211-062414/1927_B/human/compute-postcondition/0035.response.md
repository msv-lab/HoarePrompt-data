To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `array` is a new list of integers read from input.
- `rev_array` is the reverse of the new `array`.
- `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `j` is `l`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The line of code appends a character to the `ans` list. This character is determined by the count of the element at index `j` in the sublist of `rev_array` starting from index `j`. Specifically, it counts how many times `rev_array[j]` appears in `rev_array[j:]`, subtracts 1 from this count, and uses this result as an index to access an element in the `alp` list (which contains lowercase English letters).

Let's denote:
- `rev_array[j]` as `element_j`.
- The count of `element_j` in `rev_array[j:]` as `count_j`.

Then, the character appended to `ans` is `alp[count_j - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a new list of integers read from input, `rev_array` is the reverse of the new `array`, `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters, `ans` contains one additional character which is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, `j` is `l`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
