The variable `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`. Since `s` consists of characters '<' and '>', the length of `s` is simply the number of characters in the string. The other variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`.**
