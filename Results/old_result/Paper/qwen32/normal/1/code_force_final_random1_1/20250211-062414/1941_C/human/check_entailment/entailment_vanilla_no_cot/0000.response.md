Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, this approach does not necessarily give the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. 

For example, consider the string "mappppie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 2. However, to make the string beautiful, we only need to remove 2 characters (e.g., the 'm' and 'p' in "map" or the 'p' and 'i' in "pie"), not necessarily the exact number of occurrences of these substrings.

To solve the problem correctly, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach that carefully considers the removal of characters to break up the substrings "map" and "pie" with minimal deletions.
