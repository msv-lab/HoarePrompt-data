To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the range it iterates over.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3 (assuming this based on the typical progression of such loops).

We need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the current value of `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3.
2. **Determine the new value of `i`:** Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
3. **Check the loop condition:** The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `4 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Since the values of `x` and `n` are not changing within the loop, they remain the same. The variable `ans` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, but its value does not affect the loop's continuation.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 4, and `ans` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head (`i`), the final state we need to specify is:

State: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 4**.
