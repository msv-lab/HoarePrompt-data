The `print(1)` statement in the provided Python code snippet will simply print the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `n`, `power`, `i`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **1**
