Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0 before the increment, `curr` is decremented by 1. `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`. `k` are the values read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `b` is a list of integers read from the input. `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
