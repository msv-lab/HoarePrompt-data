You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis

The program aims to solve the problem of counting good subsegments in array `a` that match at least `k` elements of array `b` after rearrangement. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt_b` is initialized to count occurrences of each element in `b`.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are read.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`**:
   - The program counts occurrences of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`.

3. **Initial Window Check**:
   - It checks the first window of size `m` in `a` to see how many elements from this window are in `b` and match the counts in `cnt_b`.

4. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program uses a sliding window technique to move through the rest of `a`. For each new element added to the window, it adjusts the count and checks if the current window is good.

5. **Resetting Counts**:
   - After processing each test case, `cnt_b` is reset for the next test case.

### Potential Issues

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by resetting `cnt_b` after each test case.
  - It correctly processes the initial window and subsequent windows using the sliding window technique.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program efficiently uses a sliding window and a count array to keep track of elements, ensuring it runs within the time constraints.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program checks whether the current window matches at least `k` elements of `b` by maintaining a count of matched elements (`curr`).
  - It correctly updates the count when the window slides by adding and removing elements.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - `n=7`, `m=4`, `k=2`
   - `a=[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   - `b=[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - All subsegments are good, and the program outputs `4`.

2. **Second Example**:
   - `n=7`, `m=4`, `k=3`
   - `a=[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   - `b=[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Good subsegments start at positions 1, 2, and 3, and the program outputs `3`.

3. **Third Example**:
   - `n=7`, `m=4`, `k=4`
   - `a=[4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   - `b=[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Good subsegments start at positions 1 and 2, and the program outputs `2`.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - `n=11`, `m=5`, `k=3`
   - `a=[9, 9, 2, 2, 10, 9, 7, 6, 3, 6, 3]`
   - `b=[6, 9, 7, 8, 10]`
   - Good subsegments start at positions 1, 3, 4, and 5, and the program outputs `4`.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - `n=4`, `m=1`, `k=1`
   - `a=[4, 1, 5, 6]`
   - `b=[6]`
   - Only the last subsegment is good, and the program outputs `1`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues with the logic, and the program handles the edge cases and constraints effectively.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of good subsegments in `a` that match at least `k` elements of `b` after rearrangement. It handles multiple test cases and efficiently updates the counts for each window, ensuring correctness for all provided examples.
