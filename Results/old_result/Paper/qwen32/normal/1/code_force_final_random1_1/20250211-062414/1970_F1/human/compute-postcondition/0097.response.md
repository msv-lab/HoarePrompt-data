The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is determined to be 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', and 1 otherwise, the tuple `(i, ind)` will be added to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]`.

Here's the updated state:

- `line` still must have at least `ind + 2` elements.
- `ind` remains `ind + 1`.
- `elements[line[ind]]` is still `(i, ind)`.
- `tmp` remains 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` remains 1.
- `goal[tmp]` now includes the additional element `(i, ind)`.

Output State: **`line` must have at least `ind + 2` elements, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(i, ind)`**.
