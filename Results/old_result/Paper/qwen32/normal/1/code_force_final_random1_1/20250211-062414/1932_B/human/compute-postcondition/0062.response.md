To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given:
- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements.
- `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`.
- `ai` is the third element in `a`.
- The code snippet updates `next_year` based on whether `current_year` is divisible by `ai`.

Code Snippet:
```python
next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```

This line calculates the next year as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `next_year` is recalculated using the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

Since `current_year` was previously set to `next_year`, the new `next_year` will be the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than the previous `next_year`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `test`, `n`, `a`, `current_year`, and `ai`) remain unchanged except for `next_year`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of the old `next_year`; `ai` is the third element in `a`; `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the old `next_year`.**
