### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program and compare it to the problem requirements.

The key points to consider are:
- Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The conditions in the program are:
1. If `n == m`: This means the number of moves equals the number of cubes desired. This is possible if all moves are additions.
2. If `m > n`: This means more cubes are desired than the number of moves available. This is impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. If `m == n - 1`: This means we need one less cube than the number of moves. This is possible if all but one move are additions, and one move is a removal.
4. If both `m` and `n` are even: This is intended to cover cases where we can balance additions and removals to reach the desired number of cubes.
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd: Similar to the previous case, this covers scenarios where the parity (odd/even nature) of moves and cubes aligns, allowing for a solution.
6. Otherwise, print "No": This handles all other cases where none of the above conditions are met.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. Specifically, the conditions for even and odd numbers (`elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`) are not sufficient to determine if it's possible to reach `m` cubes with `n` moves. 

To correctly solve the problem, we should consider:
- The difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each addition or removal changes the number of cubes by 1, so the net effect of an even number of moves can be an even change in the number of cubes.

Given the above, the correct condition should be:
- If `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

Since the current program does not correctly implement this logic, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
