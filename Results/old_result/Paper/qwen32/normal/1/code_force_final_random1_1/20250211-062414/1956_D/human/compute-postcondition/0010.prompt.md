Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`
Code of the loop:
for l, r in ops:
    print(l + 1, r + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `l` is `l_next` (the first element of the second tuple in `ops`), `r` is `r_next` (the second element of the second tuple in `ops`)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `l` is the first element of the third tuple in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the third tuple in `ops`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
