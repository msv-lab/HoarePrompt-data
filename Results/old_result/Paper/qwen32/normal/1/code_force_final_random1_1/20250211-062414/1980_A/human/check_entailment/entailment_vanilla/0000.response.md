Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each requiring exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' through 'G').
   - He currently has `n` problems with varying difficulty levels stored in a string `a`.
   - The goal is to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold all `m` rounds.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`, where each test case is a tuple `(n, m, a)`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level).
   - It then counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a` and stores these counts in `freq`.
   - For each difficulty level, it calculates how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement of `m` problems per level (`max(0, m - f)`).
   - It sums these values to get the total number of additional problems required and appends this value to the `results` list.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the number of problems needed for each difficulty level.
   - It ensures that for each of the `m` rounds, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level.
   - The sum of the differences between `m` and the current count of each difficulty level gives the correct number of additional problems needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `m` is 1 and all difficulty levels are present in `a`, no additional problems are needed.
   - If `m` is greater than the number of unique difficulty levels in `a`, the program will correctly calculate the number of additional problems needed.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The provided example input-output pairs match the expected results based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
