The code sorts the list `final`. This means that the order of the elements in `final` will be changed to ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
