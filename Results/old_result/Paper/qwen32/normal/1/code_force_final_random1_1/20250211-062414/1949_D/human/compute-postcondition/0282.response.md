The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement `for j in range(1, n + 1):`, `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `j` is already `n`, the loop would terminate because the range is from 1 to `n` inclusive.

However, if we consider the scenario where the loop is about to start its first iteration or is continuing with `j` less than `n`, then `j` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `j` was `n`, the loop cannot execute another iteration because `j` would exceed the range specified in the loop head. But if we assume the state right before the last iteration (where `j` was `n-1`), then `j` should be incremented to `n` for the last iteration.

Since the task specifies to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration and given that `j` is currently `n`, there is no valid next iteration possible. However, if we hypothetically consider the state just before the last iteration, we would have:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` must be at least 1.**

But strictly adhering to the provided state where `j` is `n`, the loop terminates, and there is no next iteration to adjust for. Therefore, the state remains as is with `j` being `n`.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 1.**
