Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged.
- `end` is updated to `v` if `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0.
- If `t` is equal to 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`; otherwise, `num` remains an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `t` is the first integer from the input.
- If `t` is equal to 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`.

Code Snippet:
```
end = v
```

Impact:
- The value of `end` is explicitly set to `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged; `end` is `v`; if `t` is equal to 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`; otherwise, `num` remains an empty list; `i` is 1; `t` is the first integer from the input; if `t` is equal to 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`.**

In simpler terms:
- `n` remains the same integer between 2 and 100.
- `start` remains `v` if it was originally less than `v`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `end` is now `v`.
- `num` remains a list containing `[v]` if `t` is 3; otherwise, it remains an empty list.
- `i` remains 1.
- `t` remains the first integer from the input.
- The condition for updating `start` when `t` is 1 remains unchanged.
