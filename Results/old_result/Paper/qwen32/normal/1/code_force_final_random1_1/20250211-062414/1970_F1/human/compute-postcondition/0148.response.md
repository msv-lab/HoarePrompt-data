To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `time`: This variable is mentioned to be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. However, its exact value is not provided in the initial state, so we'll represent it as `time`.
   - `GoalName`: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to their respective goal names. Since the exact contents of this dictionary are not provided, we'll denote the value associated with `team` as `GoalName[team]`.
   - `team`: This variable is determined based on the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0. Since the exact value of `obj` is not provided, we'll denote `team` as either 0 or 1.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is formatted as `'%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team])`.
   - `%d` will be replaced by the value of `time`.
   - `%s` will be replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be a string that includes the current value of `time` followed by the goal name associated with the current `team`, followed by the static text "CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH".

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **time GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where time is the current time and GoalName[team] is the goal name for the current team)**
