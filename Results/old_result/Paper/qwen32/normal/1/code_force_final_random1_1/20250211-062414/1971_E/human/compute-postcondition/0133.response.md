To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `t` is set to `t - 1`, but this doesn't affect the calculation of `m` directly.
   - `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` and `b` are lists initialized with 0 followed by integers read from the input.
   - `ad` and `bd` are lists of differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `v` is a list where each element is the ratio of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd` (starting from index 1).
   - `l` is set to 1.
   - `m` is updated based on the formula: `m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
     - `ql` is a new integer read from the input minus `a[s - 1]`.
     - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.

2. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - The value of `m` is dependent on several variables (`b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`).
   - `ql` is calculated as the difference between a new integer read from the input and `a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is determined by finding the appropriate insertion point for `ql` in the sorted list `a`.

3. **Printing the Value**:
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the exact numerical value of `m` cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `k`, `q`, the contents of lists `a` and `b`, and the new integer read for `ql`. However, based on the described process, we can say that `m` is computed using the provided formula and will be printed as an integer.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **m (where m is the computed value based on the given formula and input values)**
