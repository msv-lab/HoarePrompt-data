Let's break down the given code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we have the following information:
- `a` is not explicitly mentioned, so it seems there might be a typo in the variable name. Given the context, it should likely be `A[r]` since `r` is 2 and `A = [0, 1, 3]`.
- `b` is explicitly given as `-11`.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- `i` is explicitly given as `1`.

Let's assume the correct variable name is `A[r]` instead of `a`:
- `A[r]` where `r` is 2, so `A[r]` is `A[2]` which equals `3`.

Now let's substitute these values into the expression:
- `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` becomes `A[r] * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`
- Substituting the known values: `3 * 2 + (-11) * 2 + (n - 1)`

Simplify the expression:
- `3 * 2` is `6`
- `(-11) * 2` is `-22`
- So the expression becomes `6 - 22 + (n - 1)`
- Simplify further: `6 - 22 + n - 1` which equals `-17 + n`

Since `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not provided, the output will depend on the value of `n`. However, we can express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **-17 + n (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
