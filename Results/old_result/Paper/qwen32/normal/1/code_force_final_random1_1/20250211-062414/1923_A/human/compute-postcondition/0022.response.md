To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop behaves and how it modifies the state based on the given inputs.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs `t` times. In each iteration:
- An integer `n` is read.
- A string `arr` of length `n` is read, containing only '0's and '1's, with at least one '1'.
- The index `x` of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` is found.
- The index `y` of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` is found, which corresponds to `n - x - 1` in the original array.
- The substring `z` from index `x` to `n - y` is extracted.
- The count of '0's in `z` is printed.

### Final Output State
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed `t` different sets of `n` and `arr`. The state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will change with each iteration, but the final output state will be determined by the last iteration since the output is printed in each iteration.

The final output state will be the result of the last iteration of the loop, specifically:
- `t` will be 0 (since the loop will have completed all `t` iterations).
- `n` will be the value read in the last iteration.
- `arr` will be the string read in the last iteration.
- `x` will be the index of the first '1' in the last `arr`.
- `y` will be the index of the first '1' in the reversed last `arr`.
- `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n - y` in the last `arr`.
- The count of '0's in `z` from the last iteration will be printed as the final output.

### Conclusion
The final output state is the count of '0's in the substring `z` from the last iteration of the loop. Since the problem does not specify the exact values for the last iteration, we can only describe the state in terms of the last iteration's variables.

Output State: **the count of '0's in the substring `z` from the last iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the number of '0's in the substring starting from the first '1' to the position corresponding to the first '1' from the end in the last input array `arr`.
