The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the current value of `i`. Since `i` is initially 0, `tmp` will be set to 'a'.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\)
- `i` is 0
- `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input
- `s` is the string provided as input
- `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`
- `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset
- `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters
- `tmp` is now 'a'
- The `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 0; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'a'; the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0.**
