Output State: **Queue is not empty (possibly with more elements); `visited` set contains all reachable nodes from `start` including `neighbor`; `current` is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue; `dist` is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue; `tree[current]` must have at least one element; `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.**

Explanation: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was added to the set by the code. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
