To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state:

- `i` is `0`.
- `d2` has been updated for all keys from `1` to `n - 2` based on specific conditions.
- `m` must be greater than `0`.
- `x` and `y` are input integers, with `y` being greater than `x`.

However, there is a critical detail missing in the initial state: the definition and values of `d1`. Since `d1` is not explicitly defined or described in the initial state, we cannot directly determine the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. 

Given this, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` without knowing their specific values.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a dictionary and y and x are input integers with y > x)**
