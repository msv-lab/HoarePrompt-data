To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `feat` is a list of integers where:
     - `feat[0]` (denoted as `n`) is greater than 1.
     - `feat[1]` is denoted as `f`.
     - `feat[2]` is denoted as `a`.
     - `feat[-1]` is denoted as `b`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from a new input line.
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.

2. **Derived List:**
   - `array2` is a list that contains elements calculated as `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for each `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, but only if `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`.

3. **Condition:**
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` must be less than `f`.

Given the print statement `print('Yes')`, it implies that the condition mentioned above is satisfied. Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply 'Yes'.

### Explanation:
The code checks a specific mathematical condition involving the lists `feat` and `arr`. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'. Since the precondition states that the condition is satisfied (`The sum of array2 plus (n - len(array2)) * b is less than f`), the output will be 'Yes'.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
