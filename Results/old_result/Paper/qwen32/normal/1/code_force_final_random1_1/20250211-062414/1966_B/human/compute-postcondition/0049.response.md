The code appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. This means that `gr` will now contain one more element, which is the input string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `impossible`, `ans`, `tc`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing one more element (the input string), `i` retains its previous value, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1**.
