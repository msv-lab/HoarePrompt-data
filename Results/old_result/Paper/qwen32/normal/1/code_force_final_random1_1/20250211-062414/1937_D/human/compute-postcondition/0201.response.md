Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` remains unchanged. If `s[i] != '>'`, then if `l <= r`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is not 0, `b` is set to 3 and `a` is set to `-2` if `l` is 1, `a` is set to `-6` if `l` is 2, `a` is set to `-12` if `l` is 3. If `l > r`, then if `r` was 0, `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is set to 2 and `b` is set to -11.**
