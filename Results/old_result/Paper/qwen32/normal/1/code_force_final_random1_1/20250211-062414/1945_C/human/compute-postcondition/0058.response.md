To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `elem` in `lst`. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust is `elem`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is 4 since `s` is "0101"
- `s` is "0101"
- `pk` is `n / 2`, which is 2
- `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1']
- `o` is 2
- `z` is 2
- `zero` is 1
- `one` is 1
- `lst` contains at least two indices, e.g., [1, 3]
- `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`, which is 1 (since `abs(2 - 1) = 1` and `abs(2 - 3) = 1`)
- `final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`; otherwise, it remains an empty list. Here, `final` is [3] because `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is true when `elem` is 3.
- `elem` is 3

Since `elem` is currently 3 and `lst` contains at least two indices (e.g., [1, 3]), the next value for `elem` should be the next index in `lst` after 3. Assuming `lst` is [1, 3], the next value for `elem` would be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 4, `s` is "0101", `pk` is 2, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least two indices (e.g., [1, 3]), `mini` is 1, `final` is [], `elem` is 1**
