Precondition: **a is a list where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following 2t elements describes a test case: the first element of each test case is a pair of integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player, respectively. The second element of each test case is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i being distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
