The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop's execution depends on the variable `t`. Since `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` has been decremented by 1.

State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
