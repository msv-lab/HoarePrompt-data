You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where a is a list of integers.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`; `s` is the sum of the elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in the list `a`, and `s` is equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`; `ops` now includes the tuple `(l, r)`; `a[i]` is `r - l + 1` for all `i` in the range `[l, r]`.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). `s` is the sum of the elements from index l to r (inclusive) in the list a, and s > (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). `s` is the sum of the elements from index l to r (inclusive) in the list a, and s > (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.
    #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. `s` is the sum of the elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in the list `a`. If `s` is equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `ops` includes the tuple `(l, r)` and all elements `a[i]` in the range `[l, r]` are set to `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, and the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` has been identified at index `pos`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`, representing indices within a list `a` of integers, such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. The function returns the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subarray within the sublist defined by the indices `l` and `r`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
