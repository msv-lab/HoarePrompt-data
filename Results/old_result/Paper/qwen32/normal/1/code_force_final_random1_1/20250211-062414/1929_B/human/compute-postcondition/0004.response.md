To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- The current value of `k` is defined as 4 times `n` minus 2. This can be expressed as:
  \[
  k = 4n - 2
  \]

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - From the initial state, we know that `k` is defined as `4n - 2`.

2. **Substitute `k` in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Substitute `k` with `4n - 2`:
     \[
     k // 2 + 1 = (4n - 2) // 2 + 1
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     (4n - 2) // 2 + 1 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n
     \]
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `2n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output `2n`, where `n` is the input integer.

### Final Output:
Output: **2n (where n is the input integer)**
