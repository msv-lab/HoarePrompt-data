Let's carefully re-evaluate the given program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description and function summary.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total points (`total_points`) as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - This is correct because the total points from all games must be even (each game contributes 2 points).

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`.
   - This is correct because each match contributes 2 points.

3. **Validation of Total Matches**:
   - The program checks if `total_points % 2 != 0`. If true, it appends `-1` because the total points must be even.
   - The program then checks if `p3 > total_matchs`. This is correct because `p3` (the highest score) cannot exceed the total number of matches played.

4. **Unnecessary Check**:
   - The program includes a check `if total_matchs > 3`. This is unnecessary and incorrect because there is no theoretical limit on the number of matches that can be played among three players. This check can lead to incorrect results when more than 3 matches are played.

5. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) using the formula: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula aims to isolate the points contributed by draws:
     - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p2`, which must come from wins.
     - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p1`, which must come from wins.
     - Subtracting these from `total_points` leaves only the points from draws.
   - The program then divides `egalites` by 2 to get the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.

6. **Final Check for Draws**:
   - The program checks if `egalites < 0`. If true, it appends `-1` because the calculated points from draws are invalid.
   - The program does not check if `egalites` is even, which is necessary because the points from draws must be divisible by 2.

### Issues Found:
- The check `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect and should be removed.
- The program does not check if `egalites % 2 != 0`, which is necessary to ensure that the points from draws are valid.

### Corrected Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function without the unnecessary check and with the additional check for `egalites`:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0 or egalites % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains an unnecessary check that incorrectly limits the number of matches and lacks a check to ensure that the points from draws are even. These issues can lead to incorrect results.

Given the original code, the correctness is:

Final: **False**
