Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is the final count of increments based on the loop logic; `bOnes` is the final count of increments based on the loop logic; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is `k + 1`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk`, or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, or both.**
