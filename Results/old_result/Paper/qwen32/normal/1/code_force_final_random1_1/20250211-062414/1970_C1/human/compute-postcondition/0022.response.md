To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head:

```python
while lst[tmp] != []:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must contain at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` is a `defaultdict` with list as the default factory containing `x-1` mappings from node `a` to lists of nodes `b`.
- `lst[z]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped.
- `tmp` is now the last element of the list `lst[z]` before it was popped.

Since `lst[tmp]` is the list associated with the key `tmp` in `lst`, and `tmp` was the last element of `lst[z]` before it was popped, `lst[tmp]` could potentially be empty if no elements were added back to `lst[tmp]` after the pop operation.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `lst[tmp]` is not empty. This can be achieved by ensuring that `lst[tmp]` has at least one element.

Thus, the state should be modified to reflect that `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now the last element of the list `lst[z]` before it was popped; `one` is False; `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element**
