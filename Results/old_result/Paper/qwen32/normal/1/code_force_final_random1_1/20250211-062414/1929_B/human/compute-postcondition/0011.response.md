To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output).
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are the values read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The `ceil` function is used to round up to the nearest integer.
- The expression `k / 2` computes half of the value of `k`.
- `ceil(k / 2)` rounds up the result of `k / 2` to the nearest integer.

### Output Description:
The output of the print statement will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**

This description accurately reflects the value that will be printed based on the given initial state and the formula used in the print statement.
