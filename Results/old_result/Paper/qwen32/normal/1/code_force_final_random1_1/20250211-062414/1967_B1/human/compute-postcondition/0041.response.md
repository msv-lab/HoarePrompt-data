Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is 0; `countmins` is 1; `g` is equal to `int(n / count)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, then `g` is indeed less than `countmins`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
