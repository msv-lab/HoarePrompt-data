Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string as per the problem statement.

The program consists of two parts:
1. The main part which reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself. It then calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string and prints the result.
2. The function `func_1` which is supposed to decode the encoded string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function `func_1` is doing:
- It creates a set of unique characters from the input string `s` and sorts them to form the string `unique_chars`.
- It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`. `i` is used to keep track of the position where new unique characters would be inserted, but it is not used in the current implementation. `j` is initialized to point to the last element of `unique_chars`.
- For each character in the input string `s`, it checks if the character is in `unique_chars`. If it is, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with the character at position `j` in `unique_chars` and decrements `j`. This replacement logic is incorrect because it modifies the string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character at position `i` in `unique_chars` and increments both `i` and `j`. However, this part of the code is also incorrect because the problem guarantees that all characters in the encoded string are part of the unique characters set `r` and should not need to be inserted.
- Finally, it returns the joined string of `unique_chars`.

The core issue with the function `func_1` is that it does not correctly map the characters from the encoded string back to the original string. Instead of mapping each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the reversed `unique_chars`, it incorrectly modifies the string `s` during iteration and returns the sorted list of unique characters.

To correctly decode the string, we need to create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character in the reversed `unique_chars` and then use this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
