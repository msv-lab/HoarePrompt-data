To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop will execute if `test_cases` is at least 1 because `range(test_cases)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `test_cases`.
- The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value before the loop starts is not relevant since it gets assigned the first value from the range when the loop begins.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it seems like `t` might be related to `test_cases`, but we can't assume that without more context. Since the problem specifies that `test_cases` is the input integer representing the number of test cases, we should ensure that `test_cases` is set appropriately.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not specified as it will be initialized by the loop**
