### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic required to solve the problem. The beauty of the array is indeed maximized by sorting the array and then computing the difference between the largest and smallest elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting.
   - Simplifying this, we get: \(\text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1\) after sorting the array \(a\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It calculates and prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.

3. **Verification**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest element is at the start and the largest element is at the end.
   - The difference between these two elements (\(a_n - a_1\)) gives the maximum beauty of the array.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case, sorts the array, and computes the required difference.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
