Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is either -1 or `v` depending on whether `start` was originally less than `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, `num` is an empty list, and `v` is the second integer from the input. Additionally, `t` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
