Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements.
- `j` is `j + 1`, but since no initial value of `j` is given, this operation doesn't affect the current state.
- `test` remains unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- The parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change, but again, this doesn't affect the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`, `test`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variable values described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
