Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The total points from all games is calculated as `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - Since each game awards either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), `total_points` must be even. If not, the scores are inconsistent, and the function returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The total number of matches played is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - The maximum number of matches that could have been played among three players is 3 (each pair playing once). If `total_matchs` exceeds 3, the scores are inconsistent, and the function returns `-1`.
   - Additionally, `p3` cannot exceed `total_matchs` because `p3` represents the highest score, which cannot be greater than the total number of matches.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest and second-highest scores (`p3 - p2`) and between the highest and lowest scores (`p3 - p1`) must account for the wins and losses, leaving the remaining points as draws.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it means the calculated number of draws is invalid, and the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2`.

### Testing the Program:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 0)` -> **Output**: `0` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 1, 1)` -> **Output**: `1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 2, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `1`)
- **Input**: `(3, 3, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)
- **Input**: `(3, 4, 5)` -> **Output**: `6` (Incorrect, should be `3`)
- **Input**: `(1, 1, 10)` -> **Output**: `2` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 6)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)

#### Additional Edge Cases:
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 2)` -> **Output**: `1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(1, 2, 3)` -> **Output**: `2` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(2, 2, 2)` -> **Output**: `3` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 0, 4)` -> **Output**: `2` (Correct)
- **Input**: `(0, 3, 3)` -> **Output**: `-1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails several test cases and does not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically, it incorrectly calculates the number of draws for certain inputs and does not properly validate all conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of draws for several inputs and does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it fails to correctly compute the number of draws for inputs like `(0, 2, 3)`, `(3, 3, 3)`, `(3, 4, 5)`, `(1, 1, 10)`, and `(0, 0, 6)`. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
