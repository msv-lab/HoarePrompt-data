The code assigns the result of `input()` to the variable `b`. This means `b` will now hold the value of whatever string the user inputs next. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string input by the user; `b` is a string input by the user.**
