To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variable `cnt`. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and updates `cnt` by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to it.

Given the initial conditions and the first three iterations, we can infer that the list `a` has at least three elements. Let's denote these elements as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.floor(a[0] / 2)`.
- After the second iteration, `cnt` is further updated to `cnt + math.floor(a[1] / 2)`.
- After the third iteration, `cnt` is updated again to `cnt + math.floor(a[2] / 2)`.

The loop will continue to iterate over the remaining elements of the list `a` until all elements have been processed. Therefore, the final value of `cnt` will be the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.

Let's denote the total number of elements in the list `a` as `n`. The final value of `cnt` will be:
\[ \text{final\_cnt} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left\lfloor \frac{a[i]}{2} \right\rfloor \]

Since the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, and `t` are not modified within the loop, they will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a`.**

In simpler terms, the final state is that the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, and `t` remain the same as their initial values, while `cnt` is the accumulated sum of half (integer division) of each element in the list `a`.
