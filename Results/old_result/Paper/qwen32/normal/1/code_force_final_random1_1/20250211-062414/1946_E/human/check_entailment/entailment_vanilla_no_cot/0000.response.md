To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. The program includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to modular arithmetic operations, likely for computing modular inverses, which are necessary for calculating combinations and factorials under modulo conditions.

However, the provided code does not include the main logic to solve the problem described. It only includes utility functions for modular arithmetic. The main logic should involve calculating the number of permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial mathematics and possibly dynamic programming or inclusion-exclusion principles.

Given the absence of the main logic, the current implementation is incomplete and cannot be considered correct for the problem as described. Therefore, the response is:

Correctness: **False**
