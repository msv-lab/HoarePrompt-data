Postcondition: **`i` is `0`, `d2` has been updated for all keys from `1` to `n - 2` based on the conditions `if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` then `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` else `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `m` is greater than `0`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and `j` is `1`. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` remains greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
