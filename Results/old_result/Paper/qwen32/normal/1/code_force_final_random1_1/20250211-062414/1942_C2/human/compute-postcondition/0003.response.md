The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
