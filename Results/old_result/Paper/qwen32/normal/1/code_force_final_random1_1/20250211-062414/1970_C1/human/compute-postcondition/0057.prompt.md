Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n nodes; `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with n nodes; `queue` is an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing all nodes reachable from `start`; `current` is either `target` if reachable, or the last node processed before the queue became empty; `dist` is the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if the target was reachable.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Queue is empty, visited set contains all reachable nodes from start, current and dist are undefined, neighbor is undefined.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Queue is empty, visited set contains all reachable nodes from start, current is the last node processed, dist is the distance of the last node from start, neighbor is undefined.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
