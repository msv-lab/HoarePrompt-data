The given code snippet modifies the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise OR operation with `1 << cur_ss`. This sets the bit at the position `cur_ss` in `cur` to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\)
- `i` is determined by the condition on `cnt` and `n`, but its exact value is not changed by the given line of code.
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers provided as input and remain unchanged.
- `s` is a non-empty string provided as input and remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is 0 and remains unchanged.
- `cur` is 0 and will be modified.
- `ans` is an empty string and remains unchanged.
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')` and remains unchanged.
- The bitwise AND operation between `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` results in 0, indicating that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set.

After executing the line `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is a non-empty string provided as input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
