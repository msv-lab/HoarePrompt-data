The code snippet `k = i` updates the value of `k` to be equal to the current value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is the previous value of `n` + 1 if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `i` is the previous value of `n` + 2.
- `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<'.
- `res` is the new user input.

After executing `k = i`, the value of `k` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the previous value of `i` (which is the previous value of `n` + 2), `i` is the previous value of `n` + 2, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', `res` is the new user input.**
