### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions and their roles:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is likely used to read \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - `func_15()` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16()` orchestrates the process by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.

However, there is a critical issue with `func_15()`:
- The current implementation of `func_15()` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to divisors or some other unrelated computation.
- Specifically, `func_15()` sums up \((n + k) // (k * k)\) for values of \(k\) up to a certain point, which does not align with the problem's requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:

Given that `func_15()` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
