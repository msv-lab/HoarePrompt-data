Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string that includes its original value plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` has an additional 'F' appended to it if either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` has an additional 'S' appended to it. `j` is incremented by 1.**
