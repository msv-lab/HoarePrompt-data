Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]` where `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `x`, and `x` is the next element in the list `l`. If `x` is 1, then `c` is `[0, j+1, j+1]`. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.**
