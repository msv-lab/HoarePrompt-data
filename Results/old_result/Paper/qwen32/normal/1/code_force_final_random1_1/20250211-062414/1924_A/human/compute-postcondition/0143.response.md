The given code snippet only modifies the `ans` variable by appending the `ss` character to it. No other variables are altered in this snippet.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. `cnt` is incremented by 1. `ans` includes `ss` at the end if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet. `cur` is 0. `ans` now includes `ss` appended to it.**
