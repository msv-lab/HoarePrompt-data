The code assigns `z` the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`. Given that `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` and `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` (which translates to `n - x - 1`), the substring `arr[x:n - y]` effectively captures the segment of `arr` from the first '1' to the last '1'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new integer read from input, `arr` is a string consisting of `n` characters where each character is either '0' or '1', with at least one character equal to '1', `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, which is equivalent to `n - x - 1`; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
