Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, or where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `nx` includes the character at position `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` includes 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, it includes 'F'. Additionally, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` includes an extra 'S' at the end if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, it includes an extra 'F' at the end. `j` is `k + 2`.**
