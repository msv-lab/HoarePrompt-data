To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variable `j` is an element from the string representation of `i`. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust directly is `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
2. **Loop Execution**: Since `i` is 1, `str(i)` is "1", and the loop runs once with `j` being "1".
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to the next integer. This is because the loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `i`.

Given that `i` is currently 1, the next value for `i` should be 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `N`, `pd`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where the first `t` elements are the cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`, with `pd[1]` increased by `int(j)`, `i` is 2**
