Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in non-decreasing order for each test case; `resultats` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `resultats` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the given code snippet.
