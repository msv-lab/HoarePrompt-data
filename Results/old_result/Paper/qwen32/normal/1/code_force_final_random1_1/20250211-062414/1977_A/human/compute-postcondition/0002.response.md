The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
