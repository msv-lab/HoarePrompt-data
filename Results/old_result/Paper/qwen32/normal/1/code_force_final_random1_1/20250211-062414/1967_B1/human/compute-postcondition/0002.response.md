The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variables `n` and `m` are updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**
