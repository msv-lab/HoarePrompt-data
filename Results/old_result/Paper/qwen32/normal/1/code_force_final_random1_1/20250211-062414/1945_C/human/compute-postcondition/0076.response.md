The code snippet assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. This calculation does not affect the values of `final`, `n`, `t`, or `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `final` is a list that either remains [1, 3] if its original length was not 0, or becomes [0] or [n] if its original length was 0, depending on the value of `c1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0.
- `s` is the user's input.

After executing `pk = n / 2`, the only new variable introduced is `pk`, which holds the value of `n / 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`.**
