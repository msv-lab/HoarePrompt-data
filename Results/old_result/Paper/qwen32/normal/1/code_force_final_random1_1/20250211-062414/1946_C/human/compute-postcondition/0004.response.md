To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:

1. **Current State:**
   - There are `num_iterations - 1` remaining iterations.
   - `num_iterations` is the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and it must be greater than 0.
   - `solve()` has been executed twice.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value does not affect the loop's execution.
   - The number of iterations is determined by the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.
   - Since `num_iterations - 1` remaining iterations are mentioned, it implies that the loop has already completed one iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The loop will execute one more time if there are still iterations left.
   - Since there are `num_iterations - 1` remaining iterations, the loop should execute one more time.
   - Therefore, before the next iteration starts, the number of remaining iterations should be `num_iterations - 2`.

5. **Final State:**
   - The state of `num_iterations` remains the same as it was read from input.
   - The number of remaining iterations is now `num_iterations - 2`.

Since `solve()` has been executed twice and this information is not directly related to the loop's control variable, it does not need to be adjusted in the state description for the loop's next iteration.

**State:** **There are `num_iterations - 2` remaining iterations where `num_iterations` is the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and it must be greater than 0.**
