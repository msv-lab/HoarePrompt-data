The given code snippet calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the provided initial state. Instead, it likely performs some operations within the function that could affect these variables indirectly through its logic, but those changes are not specified in the provided code snippet.

Since the code snippet only includes the function call and no direct modifications to the variables, we can assume that the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with the addition of the fact that the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). `s` is the sum of the elements from index l to r (inclusive) in the list a, and s > (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.**
