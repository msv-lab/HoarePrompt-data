Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 1, `i` is `n`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such index exists.**

Explanation: The value of `k` has been explicitly set to 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `best` remain unchanged.
