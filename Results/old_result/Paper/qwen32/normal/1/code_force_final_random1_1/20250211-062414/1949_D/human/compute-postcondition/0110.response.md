The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used in the `range(1, n + 1)` function. The loop will execute if the range is non-empty, meaning `n + 1` must be greater than 1, which implies `n` must be at least 1. However, from the problem statement, we know that `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 24 inclusive (`2 ≤ n ≤ 24`). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, and `n` is already within the valid range, the state does not need any adjustments related to the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
