The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`, after incrementing, `j` becomes `len(unique_chars)`. The values of `s`, `unique_chars`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters with `char` inserted at the beginning, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars)`**.
