To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5.

The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations, so it stays as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop's control structure.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[4]` is incremented by the length of `x` and `a[j]` is incremented by 1 for each 'F' at position `j - 1` in `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[4]` is incremented by the length of `x` and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 for each 'S' at position `j - 1` in `x`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the previous input string `x`, followed by the new input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, and `i` is 5**.
