Output State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.**

### Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop, the variable `cnt_b` will have been reset to 0 for all elements in `b_values` at the end of each test case's execution. This is ensured by the line `for i in b_values: cnt_b[i] = 0` which runs at the end of each iteration of the outermost loop. This means that regardless of how many times the loop executes, `cnt_b` will always be reset to 0 for all relevant indices by the end of the entire process. 

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`, and `curr`) will retain their values as they were at the end of the last iteration of the outermost loop, except for `cnt_b` which is explicitly reset to 0.
