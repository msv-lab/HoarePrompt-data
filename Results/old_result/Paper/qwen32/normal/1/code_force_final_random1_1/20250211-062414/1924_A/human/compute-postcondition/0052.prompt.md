Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` remains 0; `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers provided as input; `s` remains the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters; `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 0; `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0; `m` remains the integer provided as input; `s` remains the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set if the `i`-th bit was not set, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged; `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'a' if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1, `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0, `m` remains the integer provided as input, `s` remains the string provided as input, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set if the `i`-th bit was not set, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters, `tmp` is `'b'` if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 2, `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0, `m` remains the integer provided as input, `s` remains the string provided as input, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set if the `i`-th bit was not set, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, `tmp` is 'c' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
