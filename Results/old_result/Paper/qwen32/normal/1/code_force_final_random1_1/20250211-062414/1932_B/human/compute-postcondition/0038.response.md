Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns the result for each one. Specifically, for each test case, if the conditions are met (1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each integer in the list), it performs some computation (not detailed here) and returns the result of that computation for each test case.**
