The code sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ntest` remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains the same integers but in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100); `a` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and `a` is sorted in ascending order; `ntest` must be greater than 0.**
