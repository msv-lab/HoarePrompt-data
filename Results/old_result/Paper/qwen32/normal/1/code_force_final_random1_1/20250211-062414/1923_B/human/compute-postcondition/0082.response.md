Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers representing the health of monsters; `x`, which is a list of integers representing the initial positions of monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i; and `k`, which is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The function returns False under three specific cases (not detailed here), and returns True in Case_4.**
