The given code snippet is:
```python
arr = ''.join(input('').split())
```

This line of code reads a new string from the input, splits it (which removes any whitespace), and then joins it back into a single string without any spaces. However, the initial state already specifies that `arr` is a string of '0's and '1's without spaces. Therefore, the operation does not change the content of `arr`.

Since the content of `arr` remains unchanged, the indices `x` and `y`, which depend on the positions of '1's in `arr`, also remain unchanged. Similarly, the substring `z` derived from `arr` using indices `x` and `y` also remains the same.

Thus, the output state is the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 1, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
