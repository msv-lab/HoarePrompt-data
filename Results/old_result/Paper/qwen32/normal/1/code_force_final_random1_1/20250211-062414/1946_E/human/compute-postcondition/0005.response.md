To determine the output state, we need to understand the values of `c` and `d` which are the results of `func_1(b, a)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot compute the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `func_1(b, a)` returns two values, and those values are assigned to `c` and `d`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
return d, c
```

We can infer that the function will return the values of `d` and `c` in that order. Therefore, the output state will be the tuple `(d, c)`.

Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, we describe them as the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Output State: **The program returns the tuple (d, c), where d and c are the values returned by func_1(b, a)**.
