Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented based on certain conditions, `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `i < x - 1` otherwise `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, the `even` list includes the new element `gap`. Otherwise, the `odd` list remains unchanged.**
