To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 6
- `m` must be at least 8
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is incremented by 2 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't affect our decision)

First, let's calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` with the current values of `x` and `y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`

Now, let's check the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `10 <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `15 <= m`

From the given state:
- `n` must be at least 6, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 10.
- `m` must be at least 8, but for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 15.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 10 and `m` to be at least 15.

State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 3**
