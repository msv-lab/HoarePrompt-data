Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `total` is 0, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
