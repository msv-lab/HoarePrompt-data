The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i` of the list `a` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is assigned the value of `a[i]`, the operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in the given code snippet).
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `numTest` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` remains an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, but now `a[i]` is 0.
- `opNum` remains the value of the original `a[i]` (unchanged in the given code snippet).
- `stop` remains False unless the condition `a[i] < 0` was true before the operation, but since `a[i]` is set to 0, this condition is no longer met.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0; `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]`; `stop` is False.**
