The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from 1 up to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is 1
- `x` is `input_x`
- `n` is `input_n`
- `ans` is updated based on certain conditions involving `i`

Since the loop variable `i` is the only one that can be adjusted, we simply increment `i` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, `i` is 2**
