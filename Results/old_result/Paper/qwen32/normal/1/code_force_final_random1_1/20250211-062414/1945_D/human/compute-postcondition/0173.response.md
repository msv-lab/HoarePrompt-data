The value of `custo` is updated by adding the value of `b_values[y]` to it. The values of `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`y` is decremented by 1, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[y]`.**
