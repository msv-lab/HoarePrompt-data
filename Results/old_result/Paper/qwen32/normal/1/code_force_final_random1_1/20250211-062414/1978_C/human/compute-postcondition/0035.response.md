Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is `k - 2*i + 2` and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list starting with 1, then `n`, and then containing integers from 2 to `n-1`; `x` is 1; `i` is `i`. If `1 + i > k`, the program returns a list `l` starting with 1, followed by `n`, then integers from 2 to `n-2`, and finally `n-1` inserted at the `-k` position. Otherwise, the program does not return anything and continues with the rest of the code.**
