To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `x` and `y` are integers with lengths up to 100 digits, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9.
   - `x` and `y` have the same length.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the input lines (presumably `x` and `y` split into individual digits).
   - `new` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
   - `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
   - `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `new2` list contains the maximum digit at each position when comparing the digits of `x` and `y`.
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `new2` to a string and joins them together to form a single string.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be a string formed by concatenating the maximum digits at each position when comparing the digits of `x` and `y`.

Given this understanding, the output will be a string representing the number formed by taking the maximum digit at each corresponding position in `x` and `y`.

Output: **the string formed by the maximum digits at each position in `x` and `y`**
