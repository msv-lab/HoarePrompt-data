The given code snippet reassigns `y` to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. This means the original list `y` containing the coordinates of the centers of the disks is replaced by a new list filled with `None` values.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `x` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`.
- `y` is now a list of `None` values with length `n` (previously it contained the coordinates of the centers of the disks).
- `r` remains a list of integers where `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1].
- `visited` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `False`.
- `coef` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers where `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk with 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1]; `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**
