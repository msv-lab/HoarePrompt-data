The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` to reflect the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\).
- `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`.
- `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input.
- `s` is a non-empty string provided as input.
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is set to `ss`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `cur` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty string.
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `ss` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character of `ss` as `s[j]`. After the current iteration, `ss` should be `s[j+1]` for the next iteration.

Since we don't have the exact value of `j` (the current index of `ss` in `s`), we can only express the next state in terms of the next character in `s`.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is a non-empty string provided as input, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur` is unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

However, to be more precise, let's assume `ss` was `s[j]` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[j+1]`.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is a non-empty string provided as input, `ss` is the next character in `s` (i.e., if `ss` was `s[j]` previously, now `ss` is `s[j+1]`), `cur` is unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

For simplicity, we can just say `ss` is the next character in `s` without specifying the exact index:

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is a non-empty string provided as input, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur` is unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.
