To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, so the only variable we need to adjust is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is greater than 1
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string)
- `i` is equal to `n-2`
- `j` is `m - 2`
- `tc` is incremented by 1
- The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.
- If the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the last character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.
- `ans` is 'NO' in both cases.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1`.

Since the loop condition is `for i in range(n - 1)`, the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n-1`. However, since we are asked to determine the state just before the loop terminates, we set `i` to `n-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by 1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the last character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True. `ans` is 'NO' in both cases.**
