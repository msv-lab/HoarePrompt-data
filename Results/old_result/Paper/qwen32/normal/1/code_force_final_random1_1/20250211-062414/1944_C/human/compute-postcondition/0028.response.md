To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr`: List of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`.
   - `nums`: Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - `start`: 0.
   - `vis`: An empty set.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - Adds `start` to the set `vis`.
   - Decreases the count of `start` in `nums` by 1.
   - Checks if `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is non-zero:
     - If true, decreases the count of `start + 1` in `nums` by 1 and increments `start` by 1.
     - If false, prints `start + 1` and exits the function.

### Iteration Details:

- **After 1st iteration:**
  - `vis` contains `{0}`.
  - `nums[0]` is decreased by 1.
  - `nums[1]` is decreased by 1.
  - `start` becomes 1.

- **After 2nd iteration:**
  - `vis` contains `{0, 1}`.
  - `nums[1]` is decreased by 1.
  - If `nums[2]` was non-zero, it is decreased by 1, and `start` becomes 2.
  - Otherwise, `start` remains 1, and the function returns.

- **After 3rd iteration:**
  - `vis` contains `{0, 1, 2}`.
  - `nums[2]` is decreased by 1.
  - If `nums[3]` was non-zero, it is decreased by 1, and `start` becomes 3.
  - Otherwise, `start` remains 2, and the function returns.

### Final Output State:

The loop will continue until `nums.get(start, 0)` becomes zero. At this point, the function will print `start + 1` and terminate.

Given the pattern, the final state will be when `nums[start]` is zero, and the function will print `start + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The final output state is when the loop terminates due to `nums.get(start, 0)` being zero, and the function prints `start + 1`.

**Output State:** `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with the counts of elements from 0 to `start` appropriately decreased; `start` is the last value that had a non-zero count in `nums`; `vis` is a set containing the values from 0 to `start - 1`. The function prints `start + 1` and terminates.
