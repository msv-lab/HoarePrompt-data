Postcondition: **Queue is not empty (possibly with more elements). `visited` set contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not in the `visited` set initially. `current` is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, `dist` is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, `tree[current]` has at least one element, and `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set, the queue now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**
