To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variable `mini`.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`, which contains indices where both the percentage of '0's (`zero_perc`) and '1's (`one_perc`) in the substring `s[0:i]` are at least 50%. For each index `ele` in `lst`, the loop updates `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` (which is `n / 2`) and `ele`.

After all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`. This means `mini` will be the smallest distance from the midpoint of the string to any index where the substring up to that index has at least 50% '0's and 50% '1's.

### Final Output State
- `t`: Remains unchanged as the input integer.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as the length of the string `s`.
- `s`: Remains unchanged as the input string.
- `pk`: Remains unchanged as `n / 2`.
- `sl`: Remains unchanged as the list of characters from the string `s`.
- `o`: Remains unchanged as the count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `z`: Remains unchanged as the count of '0's in the string `s`.
- `zero`: Remains unchanged as the count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `one`: Remains unchanged as the count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `lst`: Remains unchanged as the list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.
- `mini`: Holds the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`.

### Natural Language Explanation
The final output state is the same as the initial state except for the variable `mini`. The variable `mini` is updated to be the smallest distance from the midpoint of the string to any position where the substring up to that position contains at least 50% '0's and 50% '1's.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `one` is the count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `lst` is a list of indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%, `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`.**
