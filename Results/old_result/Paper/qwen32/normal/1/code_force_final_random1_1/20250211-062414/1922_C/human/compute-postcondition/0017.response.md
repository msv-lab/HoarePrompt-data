Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\), `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `d1[i + 2]` is updated to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
