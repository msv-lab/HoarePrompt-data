Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is a dictionary, and `num` is a key in the `count` dictionary with its value decreased by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
