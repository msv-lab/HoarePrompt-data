The code assigns a value to `tmp` based on the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'`. If the condition is true, `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, it is set to 1. The values of `line`, `ind`, and `elements[line[ind]]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`line` must have at least `ind + 2` elements, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
