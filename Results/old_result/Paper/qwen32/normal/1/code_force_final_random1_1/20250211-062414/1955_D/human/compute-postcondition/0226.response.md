The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `ans` was either 1 or 2. After the increment, `ans` will be either 2 or 3 respectively.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was initially non-negative. Otherwise, `ans`, `curr`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. `ans` is either 2 or 3. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.**
