This function does not have any parameters and thus no precondition can be derived from its signature alone. However, based on the context, it seems to be a placeholder function that might be used to take input. If we consider the input format described in the problem, the expected input would be a series of test cases where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. Therefore, the precondition for the input data would be: for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6.
