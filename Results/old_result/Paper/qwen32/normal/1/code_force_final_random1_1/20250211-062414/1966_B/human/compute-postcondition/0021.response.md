The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m - 1`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `m - 1`. However, since the loop condition is `j in range(m - 1)`, `j` should be set to the next valid value within this range, which is `m - 2` incremented by 1, but since `m - 1` is the upper bound (non-inclusive), the loop will terminate after `j` was `m - 2`.

Therefore, to reflect the state right before the loop terminates, `j` should be `m - 2` (the last value it took before exiting).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first line (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the last character of the last line (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If `gr[0][j]` is different from `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is different from `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True, `j` is m - 2**
