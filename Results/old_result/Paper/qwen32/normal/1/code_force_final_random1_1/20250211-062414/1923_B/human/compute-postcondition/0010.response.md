To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the components involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `a`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `x`: Another list of integers read from the input.
- `n`: The first integer read from the input, which typically represents the length of the list `a` or `x`.
- `k`: The second integer read from the input, which could be used as a parameter for some operation within `func_1`.
- `t`: An integer greater than or equal to 1, which is decremented by 1 from its previous value. However, `t` does not appear to be used in the provided code snippet, so it is irrelevant for determining the output of this specific print statement.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet contains a conditional expression inside the `print` function:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

This means:
- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a truthy value (e.g., `True`, non-zero integer, non-empty list, etc.), the string `'YES'` will be printed.
- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a falsy value (e.g., `False`, zero, empty list, etc.), the string `'NO'` will be printed.

### Determining the Output:
Given the initial state, we know the values of `a`, `x`, and `k` but do not have the definition or behavior of `func_1`. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether `func_1(a, x, k)` will return a truthy or falsy value. However, we can describe the output based on the possible outcomes of `func_1`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a truthy value, otherwise 'NO'**
