The code modifies the value of `d2[i]` based on the values of `l[i]`, `l[i - 1]`, and `d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 3` and `n` is at least `3`, the value of `i` is at least `0`.

The output state is updated such that `d2[i]` is now equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 3` and `n` is at least `3`; `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`**.
