Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another based on the given problem description. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the cost using dictionaries `d1` and `d2`, which do not accurately represent the cumulative costs to reach each city using the closest city strategy.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**:
   - The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are intended to store the cumulative cost to reach each city from the start or end, respectively, but they are not computed correctly.
   - For example, `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` only considers moving to the next closest city with a cost of 1, but it does not account for the actual distance if the closest city is not the next one.
   - Similarly, `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` does not correctly handle the distances when moving backward.

2. **Handling Queries**:
   - The program uses the differences in cumulative costs (`d1[y] - d1[x]` and `d2[y] - d2[x]`) to determine the cost of traveling from city `x` to city `y`. However, these differences do not accurately reflect the minimum cost based on the problem's rules.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output (Based on Provided Program):**
- The program will likely produce incorrect results because the cumulative cost calculations in `d1` and `d2` are flawed.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
1. Precomputing the closest city for each city.
2. Using dynamic programming or a similar method to compute the minimum cost to travel between cities using the closest city strategy.
3. Efficiently answering each query based on precomputed data.

Given the complexity of the problem and the need for accurate cost calculations, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
