The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `pow` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `tot`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `pow` was `1`. After executing the code, `pow` becomes `2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `0`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[1]`; `pow` is `2`; `tot` is `tot + a`.**
