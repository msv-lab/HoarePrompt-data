### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and verify if it correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to read the number of test cases `t` from the input. However, the function signature suggests it takes a boolean `isOne` as an argument, which is not used in the main program flow. The function is called without any arguments in the main code snippet, so it defaults to reading from input when `isOne` is `False`. Given the context, this function seems to be incorrectly defined in terms of its parameters, but it works as expected in the main program flow since `isOne` is not passed.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads a line of input and processes it based on the `space` and `to_int` parameters. It splits the line into substrings if `space` is `True` and converts them to integers if `to_int` is `True`. This function is not directly used in the main program flow provided, but it seems to be a utility function that could be useful for processing input lines.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function concatenates elements of a list into a single string with a specified separator `sym`. This function is not used in the main program flow provided.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string. This function is not used in the main program flow provided.

5. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function finds all indices of a specific element within a list. This function is not used in the main program flow provided.

6. **Function `func_6`:**
   - This function searches for a sub-array in a 2D list where a specific column matches a given value. This function is not used in the main program flow provided.

7. **Function `func_7`:**
   - This function is the core of the solution. It reads the number of constraints `n`, initializes `start` and `end` to represent the range of valid `k` values, and processes each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 because the range is invalid.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_7` correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
- The main program flow reads the number of test cases and calls `func_7` for each test case, storing the results and printing them afterward.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. The only issue is with the definition of `func_1`, which has an unused parameter `isOne`. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program as it is used in the main flow.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
