The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by `2 * y`. Given the initial state, the variables `even` and `gap` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes its value is `ans`.

Output State: **`even` contains at least one even number greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next value in the list `even` after the current `gap`; `ans` is increased by `2 * y`.**
