The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` is now whatever integer was provided as input. The initial state mentioned that `n` was an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and this value is now updated based on the input.

The other part of the initial state, which describes `u2vs` as a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, remains unchanged because the code does not affect `u2vs`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, `n` is the input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.**
