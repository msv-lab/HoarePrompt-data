The code snippet `s = input()` reassigns the variable `s` to the new value obtained from the input. This means the original value of `s` (which was a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets) is replaced by whatever string is provided as input.

Given this, the output state will reflect the new value of `s` as provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the string provided by the input.**
