The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `ind` is 5. The value of `tmp` is determined by the first character of `line[5]`: if `line[5][0]` is 'B', then `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.

Since the exact value of `line[5][0]` is not specified, we consider both possibilities:

- If `line[5][0]` is 'B', then `tmp` is 0, and `(3, 5)` is appended to `goal[0]`.
- If `line[5][0]` is not 'B', then `tmp` is 1, and `(3, 5)` is appended to `goal[1]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[4]]` updated to `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not '..', and `elements[line[5]]` updated to `(3, 5)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, 4)` if `line[4]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', and now `goal[tmp]` also includes `(3, 5)`; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3; `ind` is 5; `tmp` is 0 if `line[5][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
