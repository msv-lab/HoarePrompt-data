To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The loop will continue as long as `n` is truthy (non-zero).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`.
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

The loop condition is `while n:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero.

Let's analyze the transformation of `n`:
- After each iteration, `n` is updated to `(n - 1) // 2`.

For the loop to execute again, `n` should be non-zero. Therefore, before the next iteration starts, `n` should be set to a value that ensures `(n - 1) // 2` is still non-zero.

If `n` is 1, then `(n - 1) // 2` becomes `0`, and the loop will terminate. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` should be at least 2.

So, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted such that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
