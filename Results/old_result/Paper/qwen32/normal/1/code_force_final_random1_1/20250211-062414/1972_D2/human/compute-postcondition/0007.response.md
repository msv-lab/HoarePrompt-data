Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The loop has executed `t` times, and no further changes to `t` or any other variables occur.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially, and the loop has run exactly `t` times. No other variables or their states are altered by the loop since the provided code does not modify any variables within the loop body.
