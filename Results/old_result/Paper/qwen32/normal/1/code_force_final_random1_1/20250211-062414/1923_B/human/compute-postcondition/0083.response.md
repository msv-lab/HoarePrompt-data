Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines whether it is possible to completely eliminate all monsters by firing bullets at them from a central position, given constraints on their initial positions and health, and a limit on the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns `False` if any monster cannot be eliminated under these conditions, and `True` otherwise.**
