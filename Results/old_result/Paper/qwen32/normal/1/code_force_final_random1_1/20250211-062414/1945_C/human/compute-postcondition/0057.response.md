Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is "0101", `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least two indices (e.g., [1, 3]), `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem`; otherwise, `final` remains an empty list, `elem` is 3. Since `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is true, `final` is [3].**
