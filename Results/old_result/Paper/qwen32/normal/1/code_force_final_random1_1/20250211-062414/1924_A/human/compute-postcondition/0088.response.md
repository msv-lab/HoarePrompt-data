Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `ss` is the next element in the list `s`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss` remain unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
