You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it determines if it's possible to change all characters to the same color ('W' or 'B') by only changing characters in the first row or the last row, or the first column or the last column, while maintaining the condition that no two adjacent characters in the first or last row, or the first or last column, differ. It prints 'YES' if it's possible, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an `n x m` grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them with that color.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks the following conditions:
1. If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors, it then checks if the top row and bottom row are uniform (all squares in the row are the same color).
2. Similarly, it checks if the first column and last column are uniform.
3. If either the top/bottom rows or the first/last columns are not uniform, it concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Potential Issues
The program only checks the top/bottom rows and first/last columns for uniformity. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the entire grid can be made uniform. Here is a counterexample:

#### Counterexample
Consider the following grid:
```
2 3
WBB
BBW
```
Here, the top-left corner is `W` and the bottom-right corner is `W`, but the grid cannot be made uniform because there is no way to turn the middle column into a single color without affecting other parts of the grid.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. It incorrectly concludes that the grid can be made uniform based solely on the uniformity of the top/bottom rows and first/last columns.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program fails to account for cases where the grid cannot be made uniform even if the top/bottom rows and first/last columns are uniform. The counterexample provided demonstrates such a scenario.
