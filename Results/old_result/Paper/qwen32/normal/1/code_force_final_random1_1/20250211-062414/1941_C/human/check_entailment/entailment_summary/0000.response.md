### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` for each test case. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for overlapping substrings and does not provide the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Non-overlapping Count**: The method `s.count(substring)` counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring. For example, in the string "mappie", the program would count "map" once and "pie" once, resulting in a total of 2. However, to make the string beautiful, we need to consider that deleting one character can potentially break both substrings. In this case, deleting 'a' from "mappie" results in "mpie", which still contains "pie", but deleting 'p' from "mappie" results in "maie", which is beautiful with only one deletion.

2. **Minimum Deletions**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions needed to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". Simply counting the substrings does not give the minimum deletions because deleting one character can affect multiple substrings.

3. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach would be necessary. These methods would consider the optimal sequence of deletions to minimize the total number of deletions required.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for overlapping substrings and does not compute the minimum number of deletions required.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
