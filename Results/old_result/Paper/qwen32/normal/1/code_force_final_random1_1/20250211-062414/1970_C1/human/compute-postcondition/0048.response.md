The only object in the loop head is the variable `neighbor`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `neighbor` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `neighbor` was processed, and if there are more neighbors in `tree[current]`, the loop should continue with the next `neighbor`.

Given that `tree[current]` must have at least one element, and assuming that the loop has just finished processing one neighbor, the next state should reflect the selection of the next `neighbor` from `tree[current]`.

State: **Queue is not empty (possibly with one more element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start (including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in the visited set initially), current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed. If `neighbor` was not in the visited set, it is now added to the visited set and the queue is updated with one more element.**

Since we don't have specific information about the order or the number of elements left in `tree[current]`, we can only state that `neighbor` is the next element to be processed from `tree[current]`.

State: **Queue is not empty (possibly with one more element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start (including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in the visited set initially), current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.**
