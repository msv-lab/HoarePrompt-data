To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step according to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: The input string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning it has an equal number of opening `(` and closing `)` parentheses, and every prefix of the sequence has a non-negative balance.
2. **Balance Calculation**: For each character in the string, calculate the balance of the prefix before that character.
3. **Sorting Criteria**: Sort the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, sort them based on their positions in decreasing order.
4. **Result Construction**: Construct the resulting sequence from the sorted characters.

### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be intended for comparison but is not used in the provided code. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function performs the main logic:
  - It calculates the prefix balance for each character in the string.
  - It sorts the characters based on the specified criteria.
  - It constructs the result string from the sorted characters.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Missing Class Definition**: The code references a `BalanceInfo` class which is not defined in the provided snippet. Without this class definition, it's impossible to instantiate `BalanceInfo` objects and the code will fail.
2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic seems correct based on the problem description, using a lambda function to sort by balance and then by position in decreasing order.
3. **Result Construction**: The result construction part seems correct as well, joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Potential Fix:
To make the code functional, we need to define the `BalanceInfo` class. Here is a possible definition:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code, it is incomplete due to the missing `BalanceInfo` class definition. Therefore, it cannot be executed as-is. However, assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined, the logic for calculating the prefix balance, sorting, and constructing the result appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Since the code is incomplete and would not run without the `BalanceInfo` class, we must consider it incorrect in its current form.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is incomplete because it references a `BalanceInfo` class that is not defined. Without this class, the code cannot be executed and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
