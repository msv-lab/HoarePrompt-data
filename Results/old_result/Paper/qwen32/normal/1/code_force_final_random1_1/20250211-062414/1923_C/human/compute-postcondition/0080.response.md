Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers with `m` being greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `a` and `b` are integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Additionally, `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.**
