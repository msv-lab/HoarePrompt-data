To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only infer that calling `func_1()` might modify certain variables or perform some operations. However, since there's no additional context about what `func_1()` does, we can assume it doesn't affect the variable `t` unless specified otherwise.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, the most reasonable assumption is that `t` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. No other changes to the state.**
