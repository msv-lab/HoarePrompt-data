To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the variable `j` is the loop variable, and the range function generates numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(1, n + 1)` will produce at least one value (which is 1) when `n` is 1 or more.

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is an empty string.
- `i` is `n`.

Since `nx` and `i` are not part of the loop head (`j` and `n`), they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, `n` must be adjusted to ensure that the loop can run.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: `j` is the loop variable, and its initial value is 1.
2. **Range Function**: `range(1, n + 1)` generates values from 1 to `n` inclusive.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is at least 1 so that `range(1, n + 1)` produces at least one value.

### Final State:
- `nx` remains an empty string.
- `i` remains `n`.
- `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1**
