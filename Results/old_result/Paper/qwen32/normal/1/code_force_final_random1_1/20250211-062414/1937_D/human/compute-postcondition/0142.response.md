Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is `i - 3` if `l = 1`, `2i - 7` if `l = 2`, `3i - 12` if `l = 3`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = B[r]
```

The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `b`. Since `r` is decreased by 1, its exact value is not given, but we know that `B` is a list `[0, 1, 3]`.

To determine the value of `b`, we need to consider the possible values of `r`:
- If `r` was initially 2, after decreasing by 1, `r` becomes 1, and `b` would be `B[1]` which is `1`.
- If `r` was initially 1, after decreasing by 1, `r` becomes 0, and `b` would be `B[0]` which is `0`.
- If `r` was initially 0, after decreasing by 1, `r` becomes -1, and `b` would be `B[-1]` which is `3`.

Since the exact initial value of `r` is not specified, we can only say that `b` will take one of these values depending on the initial value of `r`.

Other variables remain unchanged except for `b` which is newly assigned.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `i - 3` if `l = 1`, `2i - 7` if `l = 2`, `3i - 12` if `l = 3`, `b` is `B[r]` (which could be `0`, `1`, or `3` depending on the initial value of `r`).**
