Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\). `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`. `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input. `s` is a non-empty string provided as input. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is set to `ss`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `cur` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty string. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
