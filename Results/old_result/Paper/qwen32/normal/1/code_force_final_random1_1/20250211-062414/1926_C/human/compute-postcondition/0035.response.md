The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects only the variable `n`, while the other variables (`t`, `N`, and `pd`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000.**
