The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `balance`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `balance_info`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list; `balance` is 0.**
