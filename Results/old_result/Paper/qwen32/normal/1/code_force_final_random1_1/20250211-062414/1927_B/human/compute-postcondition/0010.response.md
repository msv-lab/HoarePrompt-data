The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and `l` must be greater than 3.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than 3; `array` is a list of integers; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list containing two lowercase letters, where the second letter is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, used as an index for `alp`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To be more specific, if `j` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, it would be 1 at the start of the second iteration, and so on. Therefore, if `j` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration.
