Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `a` must be greater than 0, `z` is an integer such that 0 ≤ z ≤ 50, `m` is an integer equal to 15 * z - 4 * y.**

This means that the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `z` remain unchanged, while `m` is calculated as 15 times `z` minus 4 times `y`.
