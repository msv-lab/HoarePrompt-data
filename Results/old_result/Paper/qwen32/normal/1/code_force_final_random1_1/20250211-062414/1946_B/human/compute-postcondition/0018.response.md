The given code snippet appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. This means that the last element of `smin` will now be `suf[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state, `smin` initially contains only one element, which is `0`. After executing the line `smin.append(suf[i + 1])`, `smin` will have two elements: the original `0` and `suf[i + 1]`.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing the integers 0 and `suf[i + 1]`.**
