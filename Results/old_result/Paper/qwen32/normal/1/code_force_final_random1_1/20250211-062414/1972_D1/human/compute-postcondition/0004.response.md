In this case, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of the function `func_10()`. The underscore `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. The loop will continue to execute as long as the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than 0.

Given that `func_10()` must return a positive integer, let's denote the value returned by `func_10()` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 during the current iteration. Since we don't have any specific information about how `func_10()` works or what its return value will be, we can assume that it could return any positive integer.

However, since we need to adjust the state for the next iteration and we know that `func_10()` must return a positive integer, we can infer that the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `func_10()` will return some positive integer, say `y`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and the value returned by `func_15()` has been written to standard output followed by a newline character.**

Since `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to continue, we don't need to specify a particular value for `func_10()`'s return value in the state, as it can be any positive integer. The other variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the fact that `func_15()`'s value has been printed remains true.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and the value returned by `func_15()` has been written to standard output followed by a newline character.**
