Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. If both `m` and `n` are even, then `m` and `n` retain their original values. Otherwise, at least one of `m` or `n` is even.**
