Output State: **`custo` is 130, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.
