To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state and the given conditions:

1. **Variables and Initial Values:**
   - `A = [0, 1, 3]`
   - `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
   - `B = [0, 1, 3]`
   - `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
   - `n` is greater than 0 (but no specific value is given).
   - `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'` (the specific value of `s[i]` is not given).
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (the specific value of `i` is not given).
   - `r` is either decreased by 1 or set to 1 (the specific value of `r` is not given).
   - `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`.
   - `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` (the specific value of `b` depends on `l`, `i`, `idx_A`, and `r`).

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a * 2`: Since `a` is either `0` or `1`, this expression will result in either `0` or `2`.
   - `b * 2`: The value of `b` depends on the values of `A[l - 1]`, `i`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `r`. Without specific values, we can only express it in terms of these variables.
   - `(n - i)`: This expression depends on the current values of `n` and `i`.

3. **Combining the Expressions:**
   - The final expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Given that `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, we can substitute this into the expression.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - `a * 2 + (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)) * 2 + (n - i)`

Since the exact values of `l`, `i`, `r`, and `n` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)) * 2 + (n - i) (where a is either 0 or 1, l is an index, i is incremented by 1, r is either decreased by 1 or set to 1, n is greater than 0, A = [0, 1, 3], and idx_A = [3, 4, 5])**
