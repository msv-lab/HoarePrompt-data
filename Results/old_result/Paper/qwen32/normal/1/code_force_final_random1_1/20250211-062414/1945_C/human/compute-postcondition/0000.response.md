Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The conditions and constraints for `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they pertain to subsequent test cases that are not yet processed by the given code snippet.
