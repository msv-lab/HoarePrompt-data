Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

Impact Analysis:
- The variable `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- The value of `j` is `j + 1` from the initial state, so `j - 1` refers to the original value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is incremented by `xx[i][j - 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `nx` is increased by the value located at index `[i][j - 1]` in the list `xx`. The values of `n` and `j` remain as they were initially described.
