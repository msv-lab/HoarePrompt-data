The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed) and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 1, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
