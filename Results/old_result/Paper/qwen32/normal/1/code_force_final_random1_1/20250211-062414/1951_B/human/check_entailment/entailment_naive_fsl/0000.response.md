Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the described problem. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the argument `a`, but `a` is not defined within the scope of the loop. Instead, the list `l` should be passed to `func_1`.

2. **Global Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used inside `func_1` without being passed as an argument. This will result in a `NameError` because `n` is not defined in the local scope of `func_1`.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to determine the maximum number of wins by finding the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k`. However, this logic is flawed.
   - The condition `if k == 14:` is arbitrary and does not serve any purpose in the logic.
   - The return statements do not correctly calculate the maximum number of wins based on the problem description.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as when `k` is the last cow or when the cow at index `k` has the highest rating.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The cow at index 2 (rating 3) will win against the cow at index 1 (rating 1).
- The cow at index 2 (rating 3) will lose against the cow at index 3 (rating 2).
- Therefore, the cow at index 2 wins 1 match.

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
The code will likely produce an incorrect output due to the logic errors mentioned above.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
