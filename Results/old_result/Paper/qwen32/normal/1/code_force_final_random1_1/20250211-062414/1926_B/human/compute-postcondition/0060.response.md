The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'SQUARE'`. The initial state provides some context about the variables `i`, `k`, and the contents of the list `k`, but these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'SQUARE'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `i` is set to the value of `a`, but `a` is not used in the `print` statement.
- `k` is a list containing counts of '1's from input strings `b` that contain '1's, and `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`. However, these details are irrelevant to the output of the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will simply be the string `'SQUARE'`.

Output: **SQUARE**
