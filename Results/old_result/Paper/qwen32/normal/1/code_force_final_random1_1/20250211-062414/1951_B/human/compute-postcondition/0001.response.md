The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `ind`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `ind` list.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following 2`t` elements describes a test case: the first element of each test case is a pair of integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player, respectively. The second element of each test case is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i` being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`. `ind` is an empty list.**
