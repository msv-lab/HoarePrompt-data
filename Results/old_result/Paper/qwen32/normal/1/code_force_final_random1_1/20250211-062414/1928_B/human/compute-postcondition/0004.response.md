The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Given that `tem` is `arr[i]`, the list `ans` will now contain the first element of `arr` (or the element at index `i` of `arr`). The variable `arr` remains unchanged, and `tem` retains its value.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`, `tem` is `arr[i]`**.
