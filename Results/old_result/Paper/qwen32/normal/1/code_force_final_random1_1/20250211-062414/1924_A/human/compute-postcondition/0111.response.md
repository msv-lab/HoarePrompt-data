To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the variables and their relationships based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and Their Descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\). This seems to be a loop counter or some form of limit but is not directly used in the calculation of `ans`.
   - `i`: Set to \(k-1\) if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0. This is used to determine the value of `tmp`.
   - `n`, `k`, `m`: Integers provided as input. `n` likely represents the total length of the desired string, `k` is the size of subsets, and `m` might be another parameter (not directly relevant to `ans`).
   - `s`: The input string from which subsets are being considered.
   - `cnt`: The number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s`. It is less than `n`.
   - `cur`: Represents the current state of the subset being processed. If the last subset was completed, `cur` is 0; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset.
   - `ans`: The resulting string that contains the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters, followed by `tmp`, and then 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
   - `tmp`: A character set to `'a' + (k-1)` if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0; otherwise, it remains an empty string.

2. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - `ans` is composed of three parts:
     1. The last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters.
     2. The value of `tmp` (which depends on the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur`).
     3. The character `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

Given these descriptions, the precise output of `print(ans)` can be described as follows:

Output: **The string `ans` which consists of the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters found in `s`, followed by `tmp` (where `tmp` is `'a' + (k-1)` if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise an empty string), and then 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.**

This output reflects the construction of `ans` based on the provided initial state and the logic described.
