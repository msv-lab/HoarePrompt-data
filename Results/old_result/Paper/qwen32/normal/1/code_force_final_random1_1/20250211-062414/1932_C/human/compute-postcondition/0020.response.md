The code appends `a[r]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`. Since `b` already contains two elements (`a[0]` or `a[n-1]` depending on `s[0]` and `a[1]` or `a[n-2]` depending on `s[1]`), appending `a[r]` will add a third element to `b`.

Therefore, the new state of `b` will be:
- If `s[1]` is 'L', `r` is `n - 1`, so `b` becomes `[a[0] or a[n-1], a[1] or a[n-2], a[n-1]]`.
- If `s[1]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 3`, so `b` becomes `[a[0] or a[n-1], a[1] or a[n-2], a[n-3]]`.

No other variables are modified by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing three elements, initially `a[0]` or `a[n-1]` if `s[0]` is 'L' or 'R', `a[1]` or `a[n-2]` if `s[1]` is 'L' or 'R', and `a[n-1]` if `s[1]` is 'L' or `a[n-3]` if `s[1]` is 'R'; `l` is 2 if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`; `i` is 2**
