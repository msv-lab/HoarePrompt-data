### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k` or correctly identifies when no such permutation exists.

#### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The program uses `func_4()` to validate the input. It checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`), it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.

2. **Maximum Possible Manhattan Value (`max_k`):**
   - For odd `n`, `max_k` is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2`.
   - For even `n`, `max_k` is calculated as `n^2 // 2`.
   - This ensures that the program only attempts to find permutations when `k` is feasible.

3. **Permutation Construction (`func_1`):**
   - The function starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iteratively modifies this permutation to increase the Manhattan value by swapping elements.
   - The logic involves decrementing `k` by `i - 1` for each iteration and adjusting the permutation accordingly using `func_2` and `func_3`.
   - The goal is to reach exactly `k` by the end of the loop.

4. **Swapping Logic (`func_2` and `func_3`):**
   - `func_2` swaps elements to increment the Manhattan value by `k`.
   - `func_3` swaps the `c`-th element with the `c`-th last element to adjust the permutation.
   - These functions ensure that the permutation remains valid (i.e., contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`).

5. **Output (`func_5`):**
   - If a valid permutation is found, `func_5` prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
   - If no valid permutation is found, the program prints "NO".

#### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
- It ensures that `k` is even and within the feasible range before attempting to construct a permutation.
- The permutation construction logic is designed to achieve the exact Manhattan value `k` through strategic swaps.
- The output functions correctly format the results based on whether a valid permutation was found.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
