The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means that the value of `r` is updated based on the value at the position `idx + 1` in the `data` list. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `x` remain the same; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is `int(data[idx])`; `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`.**
