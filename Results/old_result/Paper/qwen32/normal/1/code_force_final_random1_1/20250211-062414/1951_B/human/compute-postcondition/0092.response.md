The given code snippet sets `ans1` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is that `ans1` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans1` is 0; `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was encountered after the first element, otherwise 0.**
