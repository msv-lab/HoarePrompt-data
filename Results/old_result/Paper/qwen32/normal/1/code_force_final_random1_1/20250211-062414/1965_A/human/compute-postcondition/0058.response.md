To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `len(lis)`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements.
- `j` is equal to the length of `lis`.
- If the difference between the j-th element and the (j-1)-th element of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False. Otherwise, `test` remains True.
- The parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change.

In the loop, `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `len(lis) - 1`.

### Analysis:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was equal to some value, say `k`, where `1 ≤ k < len(lis)`.
- For the loop to continue executing, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, we need to increase `j` by 1.
- `len(lis)` remains unchanged because the length of the list does not change within this loop.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, `j` is `j + 1`, `test` remains unchanged, the parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change.**
