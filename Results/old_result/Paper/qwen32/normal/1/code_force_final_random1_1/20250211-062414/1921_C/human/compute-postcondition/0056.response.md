The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `array2`. None of the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `i`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of `array2` as an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0, `array2` is an empty list.**
