Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `stop` is True**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as no operation was performed on it. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was read from input and no operation was performed on it. The new variable `stop` is set to `True`.
