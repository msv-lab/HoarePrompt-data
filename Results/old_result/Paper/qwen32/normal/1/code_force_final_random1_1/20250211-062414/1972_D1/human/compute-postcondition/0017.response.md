To determine the new output state, we need to consider the impact of the given line of code on the variables involved. The line of code updates the value of `tmp` by taking the minimum of its current value and the result of the function call `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. 

Here's the breakdown:

- `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers.
- `processing` is a list of integers with `processing[di - 1]` set to 1.
- `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`.
- `rank` is a list of integers.
- `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` if `processing[di - 1]` was 0 before being set to 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1000000000.
- `di` is the next element in the list `d[da]`.

Given the line of code:
```python
tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
```

The value of `tmp` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Since we don't have the definition of `func_12`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, but we can express the new state in terms of this function call.

Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers with `processing[di - 1]` set to 1, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, `di` is the next element in the list `d[da]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `tmp` is now the smaller of its previous value and the result of the function `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
