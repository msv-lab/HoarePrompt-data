Output State: **There are `num_iterations - 1` remaining iterations where `num_iterations` is the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and it must be greater than 0, and `solve()` has been executed twice.**

Explanation: The `solve()` function has been called again, so it has now been executed twice. The number of remaining iterations remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify `num_iterations`.
