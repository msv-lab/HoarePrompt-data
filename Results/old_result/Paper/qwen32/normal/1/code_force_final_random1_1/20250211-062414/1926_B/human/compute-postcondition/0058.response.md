To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables based on the inputs provided.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user's input (let's call this `n`).
- For each iteration, it reads a string `b`.
- If `b` contains the character '1', it counts the occurrences of '1' in `b` and appends this count to the list `k`.

### Given Output States:
- After the first iteration, `k` contains the count of '1' in the first input string `b` if it has any '1's.
- After the second iteration, `k` contains the counts of '1's from both the first and second input strings `b` if they have any '1's.
- After the third iteration, `k` contains the counts of '1's from the first three input strings `b` if they have any '1's.

### Generalizing to All Iterations:
- After all `n` iterations, `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each of the `n` input strings `b` if they contain any '1's.

### Final Output State:
- `i` remains equal to `a` because it is not modified within the loop.
- `k` is a list that contains the counts of '1's from each of the `n` input strings `b` if they contain any '1's.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is that `i` remains `a`, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the input strings `b` that contain '1's.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `a`; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the input strings `b` that contain '1's.**
