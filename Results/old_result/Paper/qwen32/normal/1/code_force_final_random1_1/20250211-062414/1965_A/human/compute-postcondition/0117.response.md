Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `test` is True, `j` is len(lis) - 1, and the length of `lis` is either odd or even.**
