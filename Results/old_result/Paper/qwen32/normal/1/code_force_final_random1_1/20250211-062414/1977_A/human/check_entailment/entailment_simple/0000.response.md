### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` in the tower must satisfy the following conditions:

1. If `m > n`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because even if Nikita adds a cube every time, he can only have at most `n` cubes.
2. If `m == n`, it is possible if Nikita adds a cube every time.
3. If `m < n`, it is possible if the difference `n - m` is even because Nikita can add cubes until he reaches `m + k` (where `k` is even), and then remove cubes to reach `m`.

The given program checks these conditions but incorrectly. Specifically:
- It correctly handles the case where `m > n`.
- It correctly handles the case where `m == n`.
- It incorrectly handles the case where `m < n`. The program checks if `m == n - 1` and if both `m` and `n` are even or odd, which is not sufficient. The correct condition should be whether `n - m` is even.

Here is the corrected logic:
- If `m > n`, print "No".
- If `m == n`, print "Yes".
- If `m < n` and `n - m` is even, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

The given program does not correctly implement this last condition.
