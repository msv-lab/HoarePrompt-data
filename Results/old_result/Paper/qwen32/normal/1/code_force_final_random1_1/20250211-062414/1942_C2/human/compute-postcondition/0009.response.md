The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` was initially set to `x + y - 2`. After the increment, `ans` becomes `x + y - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `x + y - 1`.

The values of the other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements; `ans` is `x + y - 1`; `tmp` is an empty list; the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is equal to 2.**
