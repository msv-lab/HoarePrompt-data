Postcondition: **`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`; `x` is 1; `k` is `n`; `sorted_indices` and `pos` are such that `pos` is `len(sorted_indices) - 1` unless `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, in which case `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)`. `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is 1 - `delta`.**
