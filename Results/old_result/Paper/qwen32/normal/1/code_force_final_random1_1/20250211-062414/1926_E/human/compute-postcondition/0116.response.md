The code snippet modifies the value of `y` based on the given formula `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`. The values of `i` and `f` are used to compute the new value of `y`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is the initial value provided as input
- `k` is the initial value provided as input
- `s` is the accumulated sum of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d` becomes 0
- `i` is the initial value provided as input
- `d` is the initial value provided as input
- `h` is 0
- `p` is `P_final`
- `g` is `G_final`
- `f` is `k - g`
- `y` is initially set to 2 if `k <= (n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, it follows the logic described in the problem

After executing the code snippet, the value of `y` changes to `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is the initial value provided as input; `k` is the initial value provided as input; `s` is the accumulated sum of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d` becomes 0; `i` is the initial value provided as input; `d` is the initial value provided as input; `h` is 0; `p` is `P_final`; `g` is `G_final`; `f` is `k - g`; `y` is `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`**.
