Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[4]` is incremented by the length of the previous `x` and `a[j]` is incremented by 1 for each 'F' at position `j - 1` in the previous `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[4]` is incremented by the length of the previous `x` and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 for each 'S' at position `j - 1` in the previous `x`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the previous input string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, and `i` is 5.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the value at index 5 incremented by 1 and the value at index 1 incremented by 1 if the character at index `j - 1` of `x` is 'F'. If the character at index `j - 1` of `x` is 'S', `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` and `b[5]` incremented by 1. Otherwise, neither `a` nor `b` are modified at indices 1 or 5. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the previous input string `x`, and the new input string `x`. `x` is the new input string, `i` is 5, and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the value at index 5 is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', and by 1 otherwise. The value at index 1 is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F'. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` and `b[5]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S'. Additionally, if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[5]` is further incremented by 1 and `b[2]` is incremented by 1. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the previous input string `x`, and the new input string `x`. `x` is the new input string. `i` is 5. `j` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with `a[3]` and `a[5]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[3]` and `b[5]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the previous input string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, `i` is 5, `j` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
