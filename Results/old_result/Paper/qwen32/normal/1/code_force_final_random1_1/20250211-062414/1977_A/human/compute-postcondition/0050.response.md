To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given conditions and the provided initial and intermediate states.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- For each iteration (`i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`), two integers `n` and `m` are read from the input.
- Depending on the values of `n` and `m`, a specific condition is met, and "Yes" or "No" is printed.

### Conditions:
1. If `n == m`, print "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, print "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, print "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, print "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, print "Yes".
6. Otherwise, print "No".

### Iteration States:
- After the first iteration (`i=0`), the state remains as per the input values of `n` and `m`.
- After the second iteration (`i=1`), the state remains as per the input values of `n` and `m`.
- After the third iteration (`i=2`), the state remains as per the input values of `n` and `m`.

Since the state of `t`, `n`, and `m` remains unchanged throughout the iterations, it implies that the loop simply processes each pair of `n` and `m` independently without altering any global state beyond printing the result.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed `t` pairs of integers `(n, m)` and printed "Yes" or "No" for each pair based on the given conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will still reflect the last pair processed, but the primary outcome is the series of printed results.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations is simply the completion of the loop with no changes to the initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `m` other than the processing of each pair of inputs.

Output State: **The loop has completed `t` iterations, and for each pair `(n, m)`, "Yes" or "No" has been printed based on the specified conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` reflect the last pair processed.**
