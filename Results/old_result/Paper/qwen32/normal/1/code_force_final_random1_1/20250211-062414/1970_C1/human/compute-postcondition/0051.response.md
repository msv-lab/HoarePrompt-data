Postcondition: **Queue is not empty (possibly with more elements), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start (including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in the visited set initially), current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in the visited set, the queue now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.**
