The code snippet appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `ans` initially contains `[2, 3]`. After appending `2 ** i`, `ans` will be `[2, 3, 2 ** i]`.

The other variables (`k`, `n`, `b`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` equals 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` (which must be greater than 2), `ans` is `[2, 3, 2 ** i]`**.
