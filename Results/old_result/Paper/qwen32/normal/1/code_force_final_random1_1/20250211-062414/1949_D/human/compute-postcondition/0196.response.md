Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to `'?'`, `nx` is incremented by `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `'F'` is appended to `nx`; otherwise, `'S'` is appended to `nx`.**
