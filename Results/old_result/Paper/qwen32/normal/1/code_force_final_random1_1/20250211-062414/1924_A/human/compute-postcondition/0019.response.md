The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` modifies the variable `cur` by adding to it the result of `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits. This operation effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` to 1.

Given the initial state, `cur` is not explicitly defined, so we assume it is initially 0 (since it's common to start with 0 when performing bitwise operations). After the operation, `cur` will have its bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer from the input.
- `m` remains the third integer from the input.
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `ss` remains the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` remains the integer value `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
- `cur` is now `1 << cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`.**
