Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, given the price of one yogurt (`a`) and the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`).
- **Conditions**:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
  - If `n` is even, buying in pairs is optimal.
  - If `n` is odd, buy `(n // 2)` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the program again for reference:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Annotations and Reasoning:
1. **Case 1: `if B * 2 < C`**
   - **Condition**: Checks if the individual price for two yogurts is less than the promotional price.
   - **Action**: Prints `A * B` (cost of buying `A` yogurts individually).
   - **Annotation**: This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Case 2: `elif A % 2 == 0`**
   - **Condition**: Checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - **Action**: Prints `int(A * C / 2)` (cost of buying `A` yogurts in pairs).
   - **Annotation**: This is also correct because if `A` is even, buying in pairs is optimal.

3. **Case 3: `else`**
   - **Condition**: Handles the case when `A` is odd.
   - **Action**: Calculates the cost as `(A // 2) * C + B` (cost of `(A // 2)` pairs plus one additional yogurt).
   - **Annotation**: This is correct because it accounts for the remaining yogurt when `A` is odd.

### Validation Against Examples:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Test Case**: `2 5 9`
   - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - Since `2 * 5 < 9`, it should print `2 * 5 = 10`.
   - However, the correct answer is `9` (buying 2 yogurts in a pair). The program incorrectly prints `10`.

2. **Test Case**: `3 5 9`
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - Since `A` is odd, it should print `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - The program correctly prints `14`.

3. **Test Case**: `3 5 11`
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - Since `A` is odd, it should print `(3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 15`.
   - The program correctly prints `15`.

4. **Test Case**: `4 5 11`
   - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - Since `A` is even, it should print `(4 // 2) * 11 = 22`.
   - However, the correct answer is `20` (buying 4 yogurts individually). The program incorrectly prints `22`.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical errors in handling cases where the promotional price is not beneficial compared to buying individually. Specifically, it fails in the following scenarios:
- When `2 * a < b` and `n` is even or odd, it should always buy individually.
- When `n` is even and `b` is less than `2 * a`, it should buy in pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
