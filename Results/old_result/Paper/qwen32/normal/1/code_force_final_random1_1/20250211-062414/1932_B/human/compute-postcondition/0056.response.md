Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`; `ai` is the second element in `a`; `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

Explanation: The value of `next_year` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (`current_year`) and the second element in the list `a` (`ai`). All other variables remain unchanged.
