Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `cnt_b[a[i_end + 1]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is decremented by 1; `n` is greater than `m`; `k` are the values read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr` has been decreased by 1. The value of `ans` is recalculated based on the new value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
