Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `j` is set to `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by `n-1`, and if `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'; otherwise, `ans` is also 'NO'. If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` remains 'YES' and other variables retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string). If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`, and if `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'; otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'. If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` retains its value (`n-1`), `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by `n`, and `ans` remains 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
