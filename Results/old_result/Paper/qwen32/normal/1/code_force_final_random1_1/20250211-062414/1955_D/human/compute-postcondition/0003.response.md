The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, inclusive, and the input function returns `t`. However, the subsequent line of code does not use `t` and instead reads new values for `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Therefore, after executing the given code snippet, the variable `t` retains its original value, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input.**
