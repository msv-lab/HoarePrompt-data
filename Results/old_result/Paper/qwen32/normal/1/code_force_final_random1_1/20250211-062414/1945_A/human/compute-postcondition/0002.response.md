The code snippet `b += c` increments the value of `b` by the value of `c`. Given the initial state, `t` is at least 1, and there are `t` lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. After executing the line `b += c`, the value of `b` will be the sum of its original value and the value of `c`.

Therefore, the updated value of `b` will be `b + c`. The values of `a`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9; `a` is unchanged, `b` is `b + c`, `c` is unchanged.**
