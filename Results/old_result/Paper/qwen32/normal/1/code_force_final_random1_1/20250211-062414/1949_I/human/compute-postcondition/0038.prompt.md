Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `i` set to `True` if `visited[i]` was initially `False`, otherwise unchanged; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` which is `1` if `visited[i]` was initially `False`, otherwise unchanged; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements potentially set to `True`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` and possibly other elements are `1`; `tot` is a potentially updated integer; `bipartite` is a potentially updated boolean; `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `visited[i]` was initially `False`, then `visited[i]` is now `True` and `coef[i]` is `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements set to `True`, and `visited[4]` is set to `True` if the if condition was met; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` and possibly other elements are `1`, and `coef[4]` is `1` if the if condition was met; `tot` is potentially updated based on the DFS traversal if the if condition was met; `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on the graph properties, and it may have been updated if the if condition was met; `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)` if the if condition was met; `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
