The code assigns the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, `r` is now assigned the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 6`, `results` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`.**
