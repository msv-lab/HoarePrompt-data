The code counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `x`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.**
