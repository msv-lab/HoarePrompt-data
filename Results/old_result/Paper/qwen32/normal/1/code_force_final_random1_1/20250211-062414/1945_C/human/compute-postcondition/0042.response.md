To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables based on the input string `s`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n`: The length of the string `s`.
   - `s`: The input string.
   - `pk`: Set to `n / 2`.
   - `sl`: A list of characters from the string `s`.
   - `o`: Count of '1's in the string `s`.
   - `z`: Count of '0's in the string `s`.
   - `zero`: Initialized to 0.
   - `one`: Initialized to 0.
   - `lst`: An empty list.
   - `mini`: Set to 100000000.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates indices from 0 to `n - 2`).
   - For each iteration `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '0', increment `zero`.
     - If `s[i]` is '1', increment `one`.
     - Calculate `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
     - Calculate `one_perc` as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
     - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, append `i + 1` to `lst`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `zero` will be the total count of '0's encountered up to the second-to-last character.
   - `one` will be the total count of '1's encountered up to the second-to-last character.
   - `lst` will contain all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%.

Given the above, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
- `zero` will be the total count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `one` will be the total count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`.
- `lst` will contain all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50% during the loop execution.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `one` is the count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `lst` is a list of indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%, and `mini` is 100000000.**
