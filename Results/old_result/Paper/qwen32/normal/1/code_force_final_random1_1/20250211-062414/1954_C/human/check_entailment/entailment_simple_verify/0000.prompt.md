You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
- We can swap the i-th digit in `x` and the i-th digit in `y` any number of times.
- The goal is to maximize the product of `x` and `y` using the aforementioned operation any number of times.
- If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, converts them into lists of digits, and then performs the following steps:
1. It initializes two new lists `new` and `new2` to store the modified digits of `x` and `y`.
2. It iterates through the digits of `x` and `y` until it finds a pair of digits that are different.
3. For the first differing pair of digits, it assigns the maximum digit to `new` and the minimum digit to `new2`.
4. For the remaining digits, it continues to assign the minimum digit to `new` and the maximum digit to `new2`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Identical Digits**: The program handles identical digits correctly by assigning them to either `new` or `new2` without swapping.
2. **Swapping Logic**: The program swaps the first differing pair of digits and then continues to swap the remaining digits in a way that maximizes the product. However, this logic might not always yield the optimal solution for maximizing the product of `x` and `y`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
123
321
```
Expected output to maximize the product:
```
321
321
```
However, the program will output:
```
321
123
```
This is because the program swaps the first differing pair of digits but does not continue to optimize the product further.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the product of `x` and `y`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not handle all cases optimally. Specifically, it does not ensure that the final values of `x` and `y` maximize their product for all possible inputs. A counterexample was provided to demonstrate this issue.
