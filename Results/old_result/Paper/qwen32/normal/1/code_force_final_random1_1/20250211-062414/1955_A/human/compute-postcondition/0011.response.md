Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30; `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input. If `B * 2 < C`, no changes are made to `B`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, no changes are made to `A`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
