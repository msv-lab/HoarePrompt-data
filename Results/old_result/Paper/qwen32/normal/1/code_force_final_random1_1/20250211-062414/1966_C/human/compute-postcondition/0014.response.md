The code snippet provided decrements the value of `tc` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is now `tc - 1` (must still be greater than 0), `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is the result of the final evaluation of the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.**
