Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input; `i` is 1; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 2; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. If neither condition is met, `bOnes` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input where `k` must be at least 2; `i` is 3; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, no further changes are made to `aOnes` or `bOnes`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input where `k` must be at least 3; `i` is 4; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
