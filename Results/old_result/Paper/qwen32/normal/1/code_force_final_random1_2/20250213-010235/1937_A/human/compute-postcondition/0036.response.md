Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user, `power` is equal to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n`.** 

Since the if condition checks whether `power` is equal to `n`, and we are considering the case where the program enters the else block, it means that `power` is not equal to `n`. However, since `power` is defined as being equal to `n` in the precondition, this part of the postcondition highlights the contradiction to emphasize that the if condition was not met.
