The only variable in the loop head is `prob`, which iterates over the characters in the string `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `prob` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from the current test case in `test_cases`.
- `freq` is updated such that the count of `prob` (a character from 'A' to 'G') in `freq` is incremented by 1.
- `a` is a non-empty string of length `n`.
- `prob` is the next character in the string `a`.
- The count of `prob` in `freq` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `prob` was the current character being processed in the string `a`. For the next iteration, `prob` should be the next character in the string `a`.

Let's denote the current position of `prob` in the string `a` as `pos`. At the end of the previous iteration, `prob` was `a[pos]`. For the next iteration, `prob` should be `a[pos + 1]`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `a`, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`; `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case; `_` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from the current test case in `test_cases`; `freq` is updated such that the count of `prob` (a character from 'A' to 'G') in `freq` is incremented by 1; `a` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `prob` is the next character in the string `a`; the count of `prob` in `freq` is incremented by 1; `prob` is `a[pos + 1]` where `pos` is the current position of `prob` in the string `a`**

However, since we don't have the exact position `pos`, we can simply say that `prob` is the next character in the string `a` after the current `prob`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`; `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case; `_` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from the current test case in `test_cases`; `freq` is updated such that the count of `prob` (a character from 'A' to 'G') in `freq` is incremented by 1; `a` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `prob` is the next character in the string `a`**
