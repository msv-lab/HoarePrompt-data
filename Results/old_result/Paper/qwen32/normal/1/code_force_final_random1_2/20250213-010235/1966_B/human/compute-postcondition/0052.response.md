The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it determines the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing two strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; `i` is 2**
