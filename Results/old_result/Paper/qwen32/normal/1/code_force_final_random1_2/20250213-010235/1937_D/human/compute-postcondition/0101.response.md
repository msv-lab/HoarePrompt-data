The given code modifies the variable `b`. Initially, `b` is defined as `1 + 2i` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0. After executing the line `b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, the new value of `b` is calculated.

Given:
- `r` is 3.
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`.
- `l` is greater than 0.

Thus, `idx_B[r]` is `idx_B[3]`, which is `0`.

The new value of `b` is:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = b + (idx_B[r] - i) \cdot l = (1 + 2i) + (0 - i) \cdot l = 1 + 2i - il \]

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is `1 + 2i - il`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is greater than 0, `r` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `1 + 2i - il`.**
