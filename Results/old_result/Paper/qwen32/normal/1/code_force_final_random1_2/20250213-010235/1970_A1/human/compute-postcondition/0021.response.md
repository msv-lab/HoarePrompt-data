The given code sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: primarily by the `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object, and secondarily by the negative of the `position` attribute (which means positions are sorted in descending order when balances are the same).

Since the sorting does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `balance`, or the individual attributes within the `BalanceInfo` objects themselves, only the order of elements in `balance_info` changes.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted first by their `balance` attribute and then by their `position` attribute in descending order when balances are the same; `balance` is 0.**
