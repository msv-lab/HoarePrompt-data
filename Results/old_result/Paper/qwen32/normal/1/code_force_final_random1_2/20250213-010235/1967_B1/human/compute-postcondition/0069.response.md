The value of `g` is assigned the integer division of `n` by `count`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` will be `n // 2`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `i` is 2; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2`.**
