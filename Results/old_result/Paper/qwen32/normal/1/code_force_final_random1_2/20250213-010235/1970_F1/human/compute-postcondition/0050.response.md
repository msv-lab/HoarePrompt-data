Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[ind]` mapped to `(1, ind)`, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, and `line[ind]` is not a player. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[1]` includes `(i, ind)` and `line[ind]` is equal to 'G'.**
