#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not take any parameters and returns an integer, which is expected to be read from input.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from the input and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function reads input from standard input and returns a map object that yields integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that yields integers, which are derived from splitting the input string by whitespace and converting each split substring into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object that yields these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function reads input and returns a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are derived from the space-separated string input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated string input from the user, converts each element of the string into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4()`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the given function signature alone.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers derived from the input string, where the input string consists of space-separated integer values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a space-separated string of integers from the input, converts them into a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_5`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element of the list obtained by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes no input parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to a string (though they are already strings), and returns a map object containing these strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_6()`.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input provided to the function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters from the input provided to the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_7`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the provided function signature alone.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the input, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` takes no input parameters, reads a line of input from the user, splits it into words, converts each word to a string, sorts these strings alphabetically, and returns the sorted list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []

    #State: `arr` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of cumulative products up to each index in `arr`, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of cumulative products up to each index in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements up to that index in the original list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):

    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of cumulative products of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the end of the input list up to the current position.
