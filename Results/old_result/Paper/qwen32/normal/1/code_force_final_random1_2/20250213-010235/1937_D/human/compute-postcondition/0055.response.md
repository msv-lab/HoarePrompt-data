Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)` and `B` includes the new element `x` appended at the end.**
