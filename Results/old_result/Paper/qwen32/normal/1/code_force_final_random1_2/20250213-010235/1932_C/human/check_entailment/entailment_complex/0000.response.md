### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and steps of the program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the length of the array and the modulus, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the command string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` which will store the elements of `a` in the order specified by the commands in `s`.
   - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of `a` that have not yet been processed.
   - For each command in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` is appended to `b` and the respective pointer (`l` or `r`) is updated.
   
3. **Calculating the Cumulative Product:**
   - After constructing `b`, the program calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m` at each step.
   - This is done by initializing `p` to 1 and iterating over `b` in reverse, updating `p` with `p * v % m` for each element `v` in `b`.
   - The intermediate results are stored in the list `ans`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns `reversed(ans)`, which gives the cumulative products in the correct order as required by the problem statement.

### Analysis:

- **Order of Elements in `b`:** The list `b` is constructed by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. If the command is 'L', the leftmost element of `a` is appended; if 'R', the rightmost element is appended. This ensures that `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order they are removed according to the commands.
  
- **Cumulative Product Calculation:** The cumulative product is calculated in reverse order because the problem requires the product of all elements remaining in `a` before each command is executed. By iterating over `b` in reverse, the program effectively computes the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each removal.

- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation is applied at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It constructs the list `b` based on the commands, calculates the cumulative product in the correct order, and returns the results as specified.

**Correctness: True**
