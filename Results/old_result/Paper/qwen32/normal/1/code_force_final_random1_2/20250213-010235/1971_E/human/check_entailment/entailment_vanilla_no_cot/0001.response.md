Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Final destination.
     - `k`: Number of known points (excluding the starting point).
     - `q`: Number of queries.
     - `a`: List of `k` points excluding the starting point (0). This list is strictly increasing and ends at `n`.
     - `b`: List of `k` times when the car reaches each point in `a`. This list is also strictly increasing.
     - `d`: List of `q` distances for which we need to find the time taken to reach those points.

2. **Outputs:**
   - For each query `d`, output the time taken to reach point `d`, rounded down to the nearest integer.

3. **Logic:**
   - Between any two adjacent points in `a`, the car travels at a constant speed.
   - Calculate the speed between each pair of consecutive points using the formula: `speed = distance / time`.
   - For each query `d`, determine the segment of the journey where `d` lies.
   - Calculate the time taken to travel from the start of the segment to `d` using the speed of that segment.
   - Sum the time taken to reach the start of the segment and the additional time to reach `d`.

### Provided Solution Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `a` and `b` lists are extended to include the starting point (0) for easier indexing.
   - `ad` and `bd` lists store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `v` list stores the speeds between consecutive points.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, use `bisect_left` to find the position `s` in `a` where `d` would fit.
   - If `d` matches an element in `a`, directly return the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the time taken to reach `d` by:
     - Adding the time taken to reach the start of the segment (`b[s - 1]`).
     - Calculating the additional time to reach `d` within the segment using the speed of that segment.

### Correctness Check

- The logic for calculating the speed between segments is correct.
- Using `bisect_left` to find the segment where `d` lies is efficient and correct.
- The calculation of the additional time to reach `d` within the segment is accurate.
- The rounding down of the total time is handled correctly by converting the result to an integer.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently handles the input constraints and provides the correct output for each query.

**Correctness: True**
