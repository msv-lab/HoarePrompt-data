### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine whether a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. Here are the key points:

1. If both `a` and `b` are even, it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle.
2. If either `a` or `b` is odd, we need to check if the difference between `a` and `b` allows for the formation of a new rectangle.
3. If `a == b`, then no new rectangle can be formed since the only possible cuts would result in squares, which are essentially the same rectangle rotated.

#### Program Analysis
Let's examine the given code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**: This condition is incorrect. It is comparing a tuple with a boolean value, which doesn't make sense. It should probably check if `a == b` instead.
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**: This condition is always true for any non-zero `a - b`. The correct condition should check if the absolute difference is even, indicating that the smaller rectangles can be rearranged into a new rectangle.
3. **Handling `a == b`**: The code does not correctly handle the case where `a == b`. It should explicitly check for this condition and return 'no' in such cases.

#### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case. However, they do not address the logical errors in the conditions.

#### Corrected Logic:
- If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`, print 'yes'.
- If `a == b`, print 'no'.
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` and not both `a` and `b` are odd, print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the code, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
