Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 1000), and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of three elements: an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) representing the length of a string, an integer `m` (1 <= m <= 5), and a string `a` of length `n` composed of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the value of `missing` corresponding to each test case. The value of `missing` is determined based on the tuple `(n, m, a)` for each test case.**
