Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30; `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple. `total_points` is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` is `[-1]`. Otherwise, if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is `[-1]`. If `total_points` is even and either `total_matchs > 3` or `p_3 > total_matchs`, `resultats` is `[-1]`. If none of these conditions are met, `resultats` is `[egalites // 2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed). `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, and `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element. `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`, the conditions remain as specified. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` includes `-1` as its last element. Otherwise, `resultats` includes `egalites // 2` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed). `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, `resultats` includes `-1` as its last element. `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` < 0, `resultats` includes `-1` as its last element. Otherwise, `resultats` includes `egalites // 2` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
