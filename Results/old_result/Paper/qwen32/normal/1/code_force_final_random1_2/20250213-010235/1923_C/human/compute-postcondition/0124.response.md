The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least two elements.
- `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next, i, i]`.
- `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`.
- `i` is `x_next + 2*x`.
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`.

After executing `c.append(j)`, the list `c` will now be `[0, j, j, j]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least two elements; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next, i, i]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j, j]`; `i` is `x_next + 2*x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
