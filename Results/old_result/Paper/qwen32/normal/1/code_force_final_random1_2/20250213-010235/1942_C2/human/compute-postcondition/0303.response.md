Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the given inputs, which represents a specific count related to the chosen vertices and the gaps between them.**
