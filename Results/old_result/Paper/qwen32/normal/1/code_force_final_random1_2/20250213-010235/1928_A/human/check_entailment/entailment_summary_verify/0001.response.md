### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Condition for Both Dimensions Even**:
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This part is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form another rectangle.

2. **Condition for Identical Dimensions**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the syntax is wrong and the logic doesn't make sense. The correct condition would be `elif a == b:`.

3. **Condition for Odd Differences**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but the logic is flawed. The correct condition should be checking if the difference is non-zero and one of the dimensions is divisible by 2.

4. **Default Case**:
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This default case is too broad and doesn't cover all scenarios correctly.

#### Correct Logic:
- If `a == b`, output `No`. This is because cutting a square results in two identical rectangles, and no new rectangle can be formed.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, output `Yes`. This is because if one dimension is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and a new rectangle can be formed.
- Otherwise, output `No`.

#### Corrected Version of the Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the conditions for checking identical dimensions and odd differences are incorrect. The corrected version of the program handles all cases correctly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final:
Final: **False**
