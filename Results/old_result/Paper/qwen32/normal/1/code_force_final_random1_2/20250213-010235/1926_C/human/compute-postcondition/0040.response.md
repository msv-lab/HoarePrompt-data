To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` is set to 200001.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where each element `pd[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000. For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`.
- `n` is another newly input integer.

Given this setup, `pd[n]` will be calculated as follows:
- If `n <= t`, then `pd[n]` is simply the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- If `n > t`, then `pd[n]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `n`.

Since the exact values of `t` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `pd[n]`. However, we can describe the value precisely based on the given conditions.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n if n <= t, or the cumulative sum up to pd[t] plus the sum of the digits of numbers from t+1 to n if n > t)**
