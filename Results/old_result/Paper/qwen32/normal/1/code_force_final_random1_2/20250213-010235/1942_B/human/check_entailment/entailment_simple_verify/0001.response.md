### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
Given an array `a` of length `n`, we need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the given set.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order and constructs the permutation `p` using the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`. It also updates the `mex` value accordingly.

#### Key Points:
1. **Reverse Iteration**: The program processes the array `a` from the last element to the first. This is because the `mex` value for the entire permutation can be determined by the end of the array, and then we can work backward.
2. **Updating `mex`**: The `mex` variable is initialized to `n` (the maximum possible value of `mex` for a permutation of size `n`). As we construct the permutation from the end, we update `mex` to be the minimum value that hasn't been used yet.
3. **Constructing `p`**: For each element in `a`, the corresponding element in `p` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` is satisfied.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Output: `p=[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - Verification:
     - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1` (but actually `a_5 = 2`)
     - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2`
     - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
     - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Output: `p=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Verification:
     - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1`
     - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3]) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
     - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
     - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `a=[-2, 1, 2]`
   - Output: `p=[2, 0, 1]`
   - Verification:
     - `a_3 = MEX([2, 0, 1]) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
     - `a_2 = MEX([2, 0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
     - `a_1 = MEX([2]) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2`
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

#### Detailed Analysis:
The program initializes `mex` to `n` and iterates through the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum unused value. However, the update condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is redundant because `mex - ar[i]` will always be less than or equal to `mex` given the constraints `-n ≤ a_i ≤ n`.

The critical point is ensuring that the values in `res` form a valid permutation, i.e., all values from `0` to `n-1` are included exactly once. The program does not explicitly check this, but the logic of calculating `mex` and updating it should ensure that all values are used correctly.

However, there is a subtle issue: the program does not guarantee that the `mex` value is updated correctly to reflect the minimum unused value after each assignment. Specifically, the program does not mark the assigned value as used, which could lead to incorrect results if the same value is reused.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `n=3`, `a=[-1, 1, 0]`
- Expected Output: `p=[1, 0, 2]` (or any valid permutation)
- Program Output: `p=[3, 2, 3]` (incorrect)

In this case, the program would incorrectly reuse the value `3` because it does not track which values have been used.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the tracking of used values, leading to potential incorrect outputs. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
