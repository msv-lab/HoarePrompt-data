Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a` for each test case in `test_cases`.**

This means that for each tuple in `test_cases`, the corresponding LCM of the integers provided in that tuple's list has been calculated and stored in the `results` list. The `results` list is then returned by the program.
