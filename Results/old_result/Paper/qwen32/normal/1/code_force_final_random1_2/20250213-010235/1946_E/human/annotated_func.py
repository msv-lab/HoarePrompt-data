    #The program returns `d`, which is the remainder when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` is the quotient when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple of two integers. The function computes and returns the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are the integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the value of (c * a) % 1000000007, where c and d are the values returned by func_1(b, 1000000007), and a and b are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the product of `a` and the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, then returns the result modulo 1000000007.
