Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The variable `cases` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds the number of test cases. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially described.
