The given code snippet writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`. This operation does not change the values of `n` and `m` since they are not involved in the execution of the code snippet.

Since `func_15()` has already been called and its return value has been printed, calling it again in the code snippet would not change the fact that a positive integer from `func_15()` has been returned and printed. Therefore, the state of `n` and `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer from `func_15()` has been returned and printed.**
