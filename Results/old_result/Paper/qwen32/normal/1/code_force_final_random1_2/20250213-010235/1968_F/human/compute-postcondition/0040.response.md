The code snippet provided increments the variable `idx` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `idx` was `n + 3`. After executing the code, `idx` will be `n + 5`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 5`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`.**
