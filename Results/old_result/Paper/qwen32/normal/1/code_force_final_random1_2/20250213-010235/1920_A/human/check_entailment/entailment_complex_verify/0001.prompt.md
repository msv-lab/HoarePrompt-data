You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. Depending on the value of `isOne`, it either returns 1 if `isOne` is `True`, or it returns an integer input by the user if `isOne` is `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether the input line should be split into multiple items, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input line and processes it based on the boolean parameters `space` and `to_int`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)` where `t` indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and `v` is the value associated with the constraint. It updates `start` and `end` based on constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively, and collects values of type 3 into a list `num`. After processing all inputs, it calculates the number of integers within the range `[start, end]` that are not in `num` and returns this count if it is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.
- Constraints can be of three types:
  1. `k >= x`
  2. `k <= x`
  3. `k != x`
- There will always be at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
- No two constraints are identical.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then reads `n` constraints, each consisting of a type `a` and a value `x`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000` (which is the maximum possible value of `x`).
   - It iterates over each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid `k`:**
   - It counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). These are the numbers that cannot be `k`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there are no valid `k` values, so it returns `0`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid numbers (`count_num`).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `start > end`, it correctly returns `0` because no `k` can satisfy both `k >= start` and `k <= end` simultaneously.
   - If there are no invalid numbers in the range `[start, end]`, it correctly returns `end - start + 1`.

#### Verification Against Example:
- The code correctly handles the example provided in the problem statement. For instance, in the first test case, it calculates the valid range as `[3, 10]` and excludes `1` and `5`, resulting in `7` valid values (`3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`).

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples.

**Correctness:** **True**
