Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
