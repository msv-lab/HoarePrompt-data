The given code snippet assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified in the provided code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`.**
