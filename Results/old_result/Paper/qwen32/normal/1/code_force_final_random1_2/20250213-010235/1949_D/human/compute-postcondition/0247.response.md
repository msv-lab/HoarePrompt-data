The code appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `nx` is 'F'; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'; `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4]`**
