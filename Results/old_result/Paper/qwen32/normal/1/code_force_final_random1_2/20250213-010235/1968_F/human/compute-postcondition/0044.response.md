The given code snippet contains only the statement `continue`. This statement is used within loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow of the program in the given context.

Therefore, none of the variables are altered, and the program remains in the same state as before the `continue` statement was encountered.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 5`, `results` is `['YES']`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. Additionally, `x` equals 0.**
