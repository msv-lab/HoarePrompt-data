Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` > 0, and `arr` is a list of integers. If `i` is 0, `array2` is either empty or contains the single element `arr[0] * a` depending on whether `arr[0] < b / a`. If `i` is greater than 0, `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, otherwise `array2` remains empty.**
