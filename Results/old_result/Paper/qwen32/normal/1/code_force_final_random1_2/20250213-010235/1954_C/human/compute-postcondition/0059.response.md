The code assigns to `new[i]` the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Given the initial state, `a` is a list, `i` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`. This means that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both valid accesses into their respective lists.

Therefore, the value of `new[i]` will be the greater of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an integer such that the current value of `i` is not equal to the length of `a`; `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.**
