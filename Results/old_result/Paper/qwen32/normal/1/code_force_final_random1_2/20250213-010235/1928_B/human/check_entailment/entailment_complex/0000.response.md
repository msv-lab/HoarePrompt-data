### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Main Logic:
The main logic of the program is to find the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array `a`.

Here's the breakdown of the main loop:
```python
for _ in range(func_1()):
    n = func_1()
    arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))
    m = max(arr)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        a = bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)
        d = a - i
        ans = max(ans, d)
    print(ans)
```
- **Reading Input:** `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases and the size of the array `n` for each test case.
- **Processing Array:** `arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))` reads the array, removes duplicates using `set`, and sorts it.
- **Finding Maximum Frequency:** The loop iterates through the sorted unique elements of the array. For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the position `a` where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array using `bisect_left`. The difference `d = a - i` gives the count of numbers that can be transformed to be equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation. The maximum of these counts is stored in `ans`.

#### Analysis of Functions:
- **func_1():** Reads an integer from input. This is used to read the number of test cases and the size of the array `n`.
- **func_3():** Reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list. This is used to read the array `a`.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the logic against the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```
   Input:
   2
   1 2
   
   Output:
   2
   ```
   - Sorted unique array: `[1, 2]`
   - For `1`: `bisect_left([1, 2], 1 + 2) = 2`, so `d = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - For `2`: `bisect_left([1, 2], 2 + 2) = 2`, so `d = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - Maximum `d` is `2`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```
   Input:
   4
   7 1 4 1
   
   Output:
   2
   ```
   - Sorted unique array: `[1, 4, 7]`
   - For `1`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 1 + 4) = 2`, so `d = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - For `4`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 4 + 4) = 3`, so `d = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - For `7`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 7 + 4) = 3`, so `d = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - Maximum `d` is `2`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```
   Input:
   3
   103 102 104
   
   Output:
   3
   ```
   - Sorted unique array: `[102, 103, 104]`
   - For `102`: `bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 102 + 3) = 3`, so `d = 3 - 0 = 3`
   - For `103`: `bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 103 + 3) = 3`, so `d = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - For `104`: `bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 104 + 3) = 3`, so `d = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - Maximum `d` is `3`.

All test cases match the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
