The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `len(b)`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes and what conditions must hold for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was incremented by 1, so if it was `i` before, it is now `i + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `i` should be set to its value at the start of the current iteration, which is `i + 1` (since it gets incremented at the end of each iteration).
- `len(b)` should be such that `i + 1 < len(b)`, meaning `b` must have at least one more element after the current `i`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is the current value of `i + 1` (from the end of the previous iteration).
- `b` must have at least `i + 2` elements to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`v` is a list starting with 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least `i + 2` more integers, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 0, `b[1] - b[0]`, and now also `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**
