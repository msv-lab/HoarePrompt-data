Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `cnt_b` reflects decremented counts for elements in `b_values` found in the first `m` elements of `a`, `i` is `m-1`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is the count of elements in the first `m` elements of `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k` remain unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
