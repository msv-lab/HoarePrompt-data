Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers, `b` is a list where `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]` and `b[1]` is equal to `a[1]`, `new` is a list of length equal to `a` with `new[0]` set to `a[0]` and `new[1]` set to `max(a[1], b[1])`, `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` with `new2[0]` set to `a[0]` and all other elements set to `None`, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The value of `new[1]` is updated to be the maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
