Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is equal to `int(n / 2)` and `g` is less than `countmins`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
