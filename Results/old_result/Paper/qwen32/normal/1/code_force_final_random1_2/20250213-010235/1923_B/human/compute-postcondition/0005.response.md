To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the function call `func_1(a, x, k)` and understand how it affects the output.

### Given Information:
- `a`: A list of `n` integers representing the health of each monster.
- `x`: A new list of `n` integers representing the initial positions of each monster such that -n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n and x_i != 0.
- `k`: An integer read from the input.
- `t`: Must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n`: The first integer read from the input, representing the number of monsters.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement evaluates the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`. If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a truthy value (e.g., `True`, non-zero integer, non-empty list, etc.), it prints `'YES'`. Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact return value of `func_1(a, x, k)` based on the given information alone. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the behavior of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the implementation of `func_1(a, x, k)`. Since the function's definition is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the possible return values of `func_1`.

Output: **'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a truthy value, otherwise 'NO'**
