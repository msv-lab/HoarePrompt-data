To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `i <= k`. The variables `i` and `k` are the only ones involved in this condition.

Given:
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `k` is derived from the input and then `newk` is calculated as `k // 2`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i <= k` must be true. Since `i` is initialized to 1, `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Value of `i`:** `i` is set to 1.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop will execute if `i <= k`. Given `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is at least 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`**
