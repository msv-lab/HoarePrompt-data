To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the function call `func_1(b, 1000000007)` on the variables `c` and `d`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1`.

Given that `a` and `b` are integers, and `func_1` returns two values which are assigned to `c` and `d`, the output state will include the new values of `c` and `d` while `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.
