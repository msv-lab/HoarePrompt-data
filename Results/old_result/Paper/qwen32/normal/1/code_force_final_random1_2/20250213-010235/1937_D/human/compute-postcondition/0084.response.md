To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the formula used in the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A = [0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A = [3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B = [3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is not less than `r`
- `r` is not equal to `0`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `b` is calculated as `b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it remains unknown.
- `b` is defined as `b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- `n` is greater than `0`.
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it remains unknown.

Let's break down the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`:

1. **`a * 2`**: Since `a` is unknown, this term remains `a * 2`.
2. **`b * 2`**: We know `b` is `b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Therefore, `b * 2` becomes `2 * (b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)`.
3. **`(n - i)`**: Since both `n` and `i` are unknown but `n` is greater than `0`, this term remains `(n - i)`.

Combining these, the expression becomes:
\[ a * 2 + 2 * (b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - i) \]

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output the result of the above expression, where `a`, `b_initial`, `i`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, `r`, `n` are variables with their respective values as described in the initial state.

Output: **a * 2 + 2 * (b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - i) (where a, b_initial, i, idx_A[l - 1], r, n are variables with their respective values as described in the initial state)**
