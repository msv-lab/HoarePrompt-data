Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. `points` is `[10, 0]` if `team` is 1 (i.e., `obj[0]` is 'B') and `el` is not '.Q', otherwise `points` is `[0, 10]` if `team` is not 1 and `el` is not '.Q'. If `el` is '.Q', `points` remains `[0, 0]` when `len(command) == 3`. If `len(command) != 3`, `points` is `[0, 0]` unless `goalIn(pos)` does not return `-1`, in which case `points[team]` is incremented by 1. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. When `len(command) != 3`, `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B` and the element at `nxt` in `grid` is a player, then `player` is assigned the value of the element at `nxt` in `grid` and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not `.B`, no changes are made to `elements` or `player`. `time` is `current_time + 1`. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the position of `obj` in the grid, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `nxt` is calculated as the new position based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector specified by `mov[com]`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. All other conditions and values remain as they were initially described.
