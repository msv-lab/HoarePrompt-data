The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'SQUARE'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`k`, `t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `i`). Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'SQUARE'`.

Here is the detailed explanation:

- The `print('SQUARE')` statement directly outputs the string `'SQUARE'`.
- None of the variables (`k`, `t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `i`) affect this output because they are not used within the `print` statement.

Output: **SQUARE**
