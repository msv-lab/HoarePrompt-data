To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `m` is at least 2.
4. `grid` is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'.
5. `tc` is initialized to 0.
6. `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input.
7. The variable `ans` is initially set to `'YES'`.
8. If `gr[0][0]` (the top-left corner of the grid) is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` (the bottom-right corner of the grid), then `ans` is set to `'NO'`.

Given these conditions, the value of `ans` depends on the comparison between the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid:
- If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right corner (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `ans` remains `'YES'`.
- If they are different, `ans` is set to `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on this comparison.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if gr[0][0] equals gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'NO')**
