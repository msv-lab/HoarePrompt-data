To determine the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables `d1`, `x`, and `y` are defined:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations, but it doesn't directly affect the current `d1[y] - d1[x]` calculation.
2. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`n`**: Greater than 2, representing the length of the list `l`.
4. **`l`**: A list of integers.
5. **`d1`**: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. It is updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, starting from index 2.
6. **`d2`**: Another `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. It is updated based on specific conditions involving the elements of `l` from index `n-1` down to 1.
7. **`m`**: An input integer greater than 0.
8. **`x` and `y`**: Two integers read from the input.
9. **`j`**: Initialized to 2.

### Calculation of `d1`:
- `d1` is initialized with a default value of 0 for all keys.
- For indices starting from 2, `d1[i]` is updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. Specifically, `d1[i] = d1[i-1] + (l[i] - l[i-1])`.

### Calculation of `d2`:
- `d2[n-1]` is set to 1.
- For each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is updated based on the condition:
  - If a certain condition holds (not explicitly stated in the problem), `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`.
  - Otherwise, `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

### Focus on `d1[y] - d1[x]`:
- `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are values in the `d1` dictionary.
- Given the way `d1` is constructed, `d1[i]` represents the cumulative sum of differences from `l[1]` to `l[i]`.

### Output Analysis:
- The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` calculates the cumulative difference between the elements of `l` from index `x+1` to `y`.
- Specifically, `d1[y] - d1[x] = (l[2] - l[1] + l[3] - l[2] + ... + l[y] - l[y-1]) - (l[2] - l[1] + l[3] - l[2] + ... + l[x] - l[x-1])`.
- Simplifying, this results in `l[y] - l[x]`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement will print the difference between the elements at indices `y` and `x` in the list `l`.

Output: **l[y] - l[x] (where l is the list of integers and x and y are the input integers)**
