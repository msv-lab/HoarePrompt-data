Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n`: Number of lines in the grid.
- `m`: Number of columns in the grid.
- `grid`: A list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows.
- `elements`: A dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position.
- `allPlayers`: A dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged.
- `goal`: A list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals.
- `points`: `[0, 10]` if `team` is 1, otherwise `points` is `[10, 0]`.
- `t`: Must be greater than 0.
- `command`: A list of strings obtained from the input.
- `obj`: The first element of `command`.
- `com`: The second element of `command`.
- `el`: The third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`.
- `time`: `current_time + 1`.
- `team`: 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

#### Variables Involved:
1. **time**: This is `current_time + 1`.
2. **GoalName[team]**: This depends on the value of `team`.

#### Determining `team`:
- `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`.
- If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
- Otherwise, `team` is 0.

#### Determining `GoalName[team]`:
- `GoalName` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on typical usage, it is likely a dictionary mapping team identifiers to their respective goal names.
- If `team` is 1, `GoalName[1]` would be the name of the blue team's goal.
- If `team` is 0, `GoalName[0]` would be the name of the red team's goal.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `%d` will be replaced by the value of `time` (which is `current_time + 1`).
- `%s` will be replaced by `GoalName[team]` (which depends on whether `team` is 1 or 0).

Thus, the output will be in the form:
Output: **[current_time + 1] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**

Since the exact values of `current_time` and `GoalName[team]` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **[current_time + 1] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where [current_time + 1] is the time incremented by 1 and [GoalName[team]] is the name of the goal corresponding to the team)**
