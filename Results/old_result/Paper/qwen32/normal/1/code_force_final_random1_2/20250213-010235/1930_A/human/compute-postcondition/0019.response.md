The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given that `i` is `2 * n`, the value at index `2 * n` in the list `l` is added to `score`.

Since `i` is `2 * n` and `n` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2. This means `l[i]` refers to the third element in the list `l` (since list indices start at 0).

Therefore, the value of `score` is updated by adding `l[2 * n]` to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 2 * n, `score` is increased by `l[2 * n]`.**
