t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The first binary string consists of n characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'. The second binary string also consists of n characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
