The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. Given the initial state that the input value for the loop must be a positive integer, we can infer that `A`, `B`, and `C` will each hold positive integer values after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the input.**
