Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the turns between Alice and Bob and does not correctly compute the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Game Simulation**: The code does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly computes the MEX of the array `arr` after removing elements based on a greedy approach without considering the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.
2. **Optimal Play**: The problem states that Alice wants to maximize the score (MEX) while Bob wants to minimize it. The current implementation does not account for these strategic decisions.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` uses a counter to track the occurrences of each number and attempts to incrementally find the MEX. However, this approach does not reflect the alternating turns and optimal play by Alice and Bob.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
According to the problem, the optimal play would result in the MEX of the final array `c` being 5, since Alice and Bob will alternate picking elements in such a way that all numbers from 0 to 4 are included in `c`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly output 0 for this case.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
