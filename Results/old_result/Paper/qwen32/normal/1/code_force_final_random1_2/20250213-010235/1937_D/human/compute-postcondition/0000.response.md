The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', the length of `s` is simply the number of characters in the string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s`.**
