To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they contribute to the final output.

### Key Variables and Their Roles:
- **`time`**: This represents the current time in the simulation, incremented by 1 from `current_time`.
- **`GoalName`**: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to their respective goal names. Given the context, `GoalName[1]` would likely be "BLUE GOAL" and `GoalName[0]` would likely be "RED GOAL".
- **`team`**: This is determined based on the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is set to 1 (indicating the Blue team). Otherwise, `team` is set to 0 (indicating the Red team).

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- **`%d`**: This is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `time`.
- **`%s`**: This is a placeholder for a string, which will be replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`.

### Determining the Values:
- **`time`**: Since `time` is described as `current_time + 1`, it will be an integer value that is one more than the previous `current_time`.
- **`GoalName[team]`**: This depends on the value of `team`. If `team` is 1, it will print "BLUE GOAL". If `team` is 0, it will print "RED GOAL".

### Final Output:
Given the placeholders and the logic described, the output will be:
- An integer representing the current time (`time`).
- A string representing the goal name based on the team (`GoalName[team]`).
- The phrase "CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" appended at the end.

### Conclusion:
The exact integer value of `time` and the specific goal name depend on the values of `current_time` and `team` respectively, but the structure of the output is consistent.

Output: **`time GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH` (where `time` is the current time incremented by 1, and `GoalName[team]` is the goal name corresponding to the team, either "BLUE GOAL" or "RED GOAL")**
