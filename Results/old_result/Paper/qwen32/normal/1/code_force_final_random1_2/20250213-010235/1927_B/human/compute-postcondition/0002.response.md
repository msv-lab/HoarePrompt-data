The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `array`. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `l` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
