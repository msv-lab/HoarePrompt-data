The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `lst` will now contain the value 2.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` must be at least 2; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is `[2]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is `[2]`; `mini` is `100000000`; `i` is 1; `zero_perc` is `50` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is `0`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

In simpler terms, the list `lst` now contains the single element `2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
