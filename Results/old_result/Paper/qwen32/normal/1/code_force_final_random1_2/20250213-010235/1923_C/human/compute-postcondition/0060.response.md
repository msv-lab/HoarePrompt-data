The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, the new value of `i` will be `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element; `p` is [0]; `c` is [0]; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.**
