The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. The value of `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is defined as `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t` and `k`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `L` is an empty list
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

After executing `L.append(m)`, the list `L` now contains one element, which is `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is `[m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
