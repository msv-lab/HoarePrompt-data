The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `cnt_b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is `0`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input.**
