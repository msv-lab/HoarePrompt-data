The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 2. This change affects only the `idx` variable, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 3)])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key.**
