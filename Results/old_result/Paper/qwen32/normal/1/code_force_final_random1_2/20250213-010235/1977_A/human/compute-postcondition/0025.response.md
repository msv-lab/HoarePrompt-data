The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the new input, while the other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- Conditions about the relationship between `n` and `m` are provided.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` will be reassigned to the new values read from the input.
- `t` and `i` retain their original values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input.**
