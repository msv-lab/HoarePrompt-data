The code snippet increments the `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `score` is updated to `score + l[4]`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, after executing the code, `score` becomes `l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is `l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`, `i` is 4**.
