The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. This overwrites the previous values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.

Given the initial state, `v` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variable `q` was initially `q + 1` (from the previous state), but it is now overwritten by the input value. The variable `l` retains its previous value of `q` before the new `q` is assigned.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `q` is the third integer from the input; `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment.**
