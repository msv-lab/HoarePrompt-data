To determine the new output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
```

Given Initial State:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`
- `b` is 1 if `l - r > 0`

The only variable being modified here is `b`. The new value of `b` depends on the current value of `b`, `i`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `r`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `b`. However, we can express the new value of `b` in terms of these variables.

The new value of `b` is:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = b + (i - \text{idx\_A}[l - 1]) * r \]

Given `i` is 1, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = b + (1 - \text{idx\_A}[l - 1]) * r \]

Thus, the updated value of `b` is dependent on the values of `b`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `r`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, `b` is `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`**.
