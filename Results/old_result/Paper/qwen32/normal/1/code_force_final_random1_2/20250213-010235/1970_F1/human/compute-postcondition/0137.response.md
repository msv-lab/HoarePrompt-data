Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, and `points` is `[0, 0]` unless `goalIn(pos)` does not return `-1`, in which case `points[team]` is incremented by 1. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input with a length of 2. `obj` is the first element of `command`. `com` is the second element of `command`. `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`. `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and the element at `nxt` in `grid` is a player, or if `obj` is a player and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of the element at `nxt` in `grid`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` does not return `-1`, `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `obj` is a player and `com` is not 'T', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.**
