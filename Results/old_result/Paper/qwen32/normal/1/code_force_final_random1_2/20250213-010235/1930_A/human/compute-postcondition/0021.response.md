The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the `score` by the value at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is initially set to `2 * n - 2`, the value added to `score` is `l[2 * n - 2]`.

Since `score` was previously increased by `l[2 * n]`, the new value of `score` will be the sum of its previous value (which included `l[2 * n]`) plus `l[2 * n - 2]`.

Therefore, the updated `score` will be the original `score` (which already includes `l[2 * n]`) plus `l[2 * n - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 2 * n - 2, `score` is increased by `l[2 * n]` and `l[2 * n - 2]`.**
