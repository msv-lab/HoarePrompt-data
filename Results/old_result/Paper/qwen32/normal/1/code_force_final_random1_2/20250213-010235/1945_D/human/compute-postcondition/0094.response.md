To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `c`**: It is defined as `c + 1`, but since there's no initial value given for `c`, we can assume it was previously set to some integer value and then incremented by 1. For the purpose of this explanation, let's denote its current value as `c`.

2. **Variable `cases`**: It is described as being greater than `c + 1`. This indicates that `cases` is an integer larger than the incremented value of `c`.

3. **Variable `na_frente`**: It is the first integer from the input minus 1. Let's denote the first integer from the input as `input1`; therefore, `na_frente = input1 - 1`.

4. **Variable `pos_final`**: It is the second integer from the input minus 1. Let's denote the second integer from the input as `input2`; therefore, `pos_final = input2 - 1`.

5. **Lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`**: These are lists of integers derived from the input. Their specific contents are not provided, so we can only refer to them generally.

6. **Variable `total`**: It represents the accumulated sum of the smallest costs encountered during some process. The exact value is not specified, but it is used in calculations related to finding the best cost.

7. **Variable `best`**: It is the minimum cost found when a certain condition (`v <= pos_final`) is met. The exact value of `best` depends on the values in the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and the logic used to find the minimum cost under the specified condition.

Given the above information, the `print(best)` statement will output the minimum cost found when the condition `v <= pos_final` is satisfied. Since the exact values of the lists and the specific logic to determine `best` are not provided, we can only describe `best` in terms of the condition it satisfies.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum cost found when v <= pos_final)**
