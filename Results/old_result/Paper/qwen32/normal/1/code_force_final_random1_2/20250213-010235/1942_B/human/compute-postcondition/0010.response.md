To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the list `ar`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

### State Adjustment:
- **`i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- **`ar`**: The list `ar` does not change during the loop iterations as per the information given.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `n - ar[i]`.
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a certain value.

### Example Adjustment:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x - 1`.

### Final State:
Assuming `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `x - 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we express the new value of `i` as `x - 1`.

If we assume the end of the previous iteration had `i` as `len(ar) - 1` (the first iteration), then the next iteration would have `i` as `len(ar) - 2`.

So, generally:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**.

But to be general:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `x - 1`**.

Where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
