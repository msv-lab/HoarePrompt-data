Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[n - 1]` set to 1, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration. Additionally, `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`.**
