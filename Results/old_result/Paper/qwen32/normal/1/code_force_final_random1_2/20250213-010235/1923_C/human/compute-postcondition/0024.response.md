The given code appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element
- `p` is [0, `i`, `i + 2*x`, `i + 2*x`]
- `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]
- `i` is `i + 2*x`
- `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`

After executing `c.append(j)`, the list `c` will now have an additional element which is the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`, `i + 2*x`, `i + 2*x`]; `c` is [0, `j`, `j`, `j`]; `i` is `i + 2*x`; `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
