The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` to reflect the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`
- If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`
- If after the update, `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` becomes 1 and `ans` becomes the string `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.

To proceed to the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`.

Let's denote the current position of `ss` in the string `s` as `index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was `s[index]`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[index + 1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `index` from the given state, we can infer that `ss` should be the next character in the sequence. If `ss` was the last character in the string `s`, the loop would terminate, so we assume `ss` is not the last character.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `ss` as the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated based on the condition `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `s` if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is an empty string**.
