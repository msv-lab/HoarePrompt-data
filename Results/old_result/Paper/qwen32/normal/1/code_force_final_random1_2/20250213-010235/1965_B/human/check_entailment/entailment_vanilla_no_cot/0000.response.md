To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers with a size of at most 25.
- The sequence must satisfy two conditions:
  1. There should be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
  2. For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The main function responsible for generating the sequence is `func_14()`. Here's how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()` which splits the input line into integers.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It converts `n` to its binary representation (`b`) and calculates its length (`l`).
   - It also converts `k` to its binary representation (`bk`) and calculates its length (`lk`).

3. **Handling Special Case (k == 1):**
   - If `k` is 1, it handles this separately:
     - If `n` is 2, it returns `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`.

4. **General Case (k != 1):**
   - It initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`.
   - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to `ans`.
   - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to `ans`.
   - It appends additional powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`.

5. **Output:**
   - It joins the elements of `ans` into a string separated by spaces and returns it.

### Checking the Conditions:
- **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
  - The program specifically avoids including `k` directly in the sequence.
  - It constructs the sequence in such a way that no combination of its elements sums to `k`.
  
- **Subsequences Sum to All Values from 1 to `n` (except `k`):**
  - By including powers of 2 and specific calculated values, the program ensures that all possible sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
  - This is because powers of 2 can form any sum through combinations, and the additional values ensure that `k` cannot be formed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly generate sequences that meet the problem's requirements for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
