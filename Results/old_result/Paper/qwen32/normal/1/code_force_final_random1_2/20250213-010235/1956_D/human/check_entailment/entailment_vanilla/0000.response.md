Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation up to `5*10^5` times.
- The operation involves selecting a subarray from index `l` to `r`, computing the MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide a sequence of operations achieving this sum.

### Code Analysis:
1. **func_1(a, l, r, ops)**:
   - This function seems to recursively process the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `l` is not `0`. If not, it sets it to `0` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
   - After the recursive call, it checks if the element at `l` is not equal to `r-l+1`. If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1` and records the operation.
   - This part of the code seems to aim at setting the subarray to the MEX value but has some logical issues.

2. **func_2(a)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n-1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which will cause a `NameError`.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r-l+1)*(r-l+1)`, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively processing the left and right parts.
   - There are several issues here:
     - `func_1` is called without passing the `ops` list.
     - The logic for splitting around the maximum element is not clearly aligned with maximizing the sum using MEX operations.

4. **func_3()**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - Since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` have issues, this function will not produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The code has several issues:
- Missing parameter passing (`ops` list).
- Incorrect logic for setting subarrays to MEX values.
- Incorrect logic for splitting subarrays around the maximum element.
- Lack of proper handling of the MEX computation.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
