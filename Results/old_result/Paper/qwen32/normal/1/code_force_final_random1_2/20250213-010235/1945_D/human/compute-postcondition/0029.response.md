Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `na_frente - 1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `v` remains `na_frente - 1`. The value of `best` is either unchanged if it was already greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or it is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
