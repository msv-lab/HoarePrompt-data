In this task, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop. The loop iterates a number of times based on the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. Let's break down the problem:

- The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop body.
- The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- The input read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is a positive integer.
- The function `solve()` has been executed.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used in the loop body.
- The number of iterations is determined by the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. Since this value is used to control the loop, it should remain unchanged.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state, and the number of iterations is controlled by the input integer which remains constant, the state does not change in terms of the loop control variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop is set to execute again if there are remaining iterations.

State: **The input read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is a positive integer, and the function `solve()` has been executed.**
