To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the loop modifies the variables and how these modifications accumulate over the iterations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Iteration Count**: The loop runs `q` times.
2. **Index Update**: `idx` is incremented by 2 at the end of each iteration.
3. **Results List**: After each iteration, `results` is appended with either `'YES'` or `'NO'`.
4. **State of Variables**: The variables `data`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` do not change within the loop.

### Final State Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `data`: A list of strings representing the input values.
  - `t`: Incremented by 1 initially.
  - `idx`: Calculated as `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4 + n`.
  - `results`: A list with `q + 2` elements, starting with an empty string, followed by `q` elements (`'YES'` or `'NO'`), and ending with an empty string.
  - `n`: Integer value from `data[idx - 2 - n]`.
  - `q`: Integer value from `data[idx - 3 - n]`.
  - `a`: List of integers derived from `data`.
  - `pf`: Cumulative XOR of `a`.
  - `mp`: Dictionary mapping cumulative XOR values to their indices.

- **After All Iterations**:
  - **`t`**: Remains `t + 1`.
  - **`idx`**: Incremented by `2 * q` (since `idx` is increased by 2 in each of the `q` iterations).
  - **`results`**: Will have `q + 2` elements initially plus `q` more elements appended during the loop, making it `2*q + 2` elements long. The first element will be an empty string, followed by `2*q + 1` elements (`'YES'` or `'NO'`), and the last element will be an empty string.
  - **Other Variables**: `data`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
- **`data`**: Unchanged.
- **`t`**: `t + 1`.
- **`idx`**: `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4 + n + 2*q`.
- **`results`**: A list with `2*q + 2` elements, starting with an empty string, followed by `2*q + 1` elements (`'YES'` or `'NO'`), and ending with an empty string.
- **`n`**: Unchanged.
- **`q`**: Unchanged.
- **`a`**: Unchanged.
- **`pf`**: Unchanged.
- **`mp`**: Unchanged.

### Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 6*q + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing `2*q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `2*q + 1` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs.**

### Human-readable Description:
After all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain `2*q + 2` elements, starting and ending with an empty string, and the middle `2*q + 1` elements will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, depending on the conditions checked within the loop. The `idx` will have been incremented by `2*q` from its initial value, and other variables like `data`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` will remain unchanged.
