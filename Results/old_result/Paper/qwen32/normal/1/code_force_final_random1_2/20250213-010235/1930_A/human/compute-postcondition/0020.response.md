To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `2 * n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to `2 * n`.

For the loop to execute another iteration, `i` must be less than `2 * n` and should be incremented by 2 according to the loop's step.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `n` must be at least 1 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `i` is currently `2 * n` (This needs adjustment because it is the loop variable).
- `score` is increased by `l[2 * n]` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).

Since `i` is currently `2 * n`, the loop would terminate if it were to start with this value. To continue the loop, `i` must be the next value in the sequence, which is `2 * n - 2`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `2 * n - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 2 * n - 2, `score` is increased by `l[2 * n]`**
