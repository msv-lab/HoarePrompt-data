To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the nature of the loop and the given information. The loop iterates over each tuple `(l, r)` in the list `ops`. Each iteration prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Given the initial state and the states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `ops` contains multiple tuples, and the loop continues until all tuples have been processed.

After all iterations, the state of the variables `a`, `n`, `s`, and `m` remains unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The only variable that changes is the tuple being processed from `ops`, but since all tuples will have been processed, there are no more tuples left in `ops` to process.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2`, `ops` is an empty list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `a`, the integer `n`, and the values `s` and `m` remain the same as they were initially. The list `ops` will be empty because all its elements (tuples) have been processed and printed.
