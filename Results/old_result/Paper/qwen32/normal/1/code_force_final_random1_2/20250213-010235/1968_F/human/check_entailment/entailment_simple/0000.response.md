### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining if a subarray can be split into multiple parts with equal bitwise XOR values. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings (`data`). This is efficient for handling large inputs.
   - It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it initializes an array `a` to store the input values and a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` represents the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array (`x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`).
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the entire subarray has an XOR of `0`, which implies it can be split into any number of parts with XOR `0`. Hence, it appends `'YES'` to the results.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that `l <= i <= r` and `pf[i] == pf[r]` and another index `j` such that `l <= j <= r` and `pf[j] == pf[l-1]`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the lists stored in `mp`.
   - If such indices exist, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values, and it appends `'YES'` to the results. Otherwise, it appends `'NO'`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for a test case, it appends an empty string to `results` to separate the outputs of different test cases.
   - Finally, it prints all results joined by newline characters.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here are some key points that support its correctness:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly computed, and it allows efficient calculation of the XOR of any subarray.
- **Dictionary Mapping:** The dictionary `mp` efficiently maps prefix XOR values to their respective indices, enabling quick lookups during query processing.
- **Query Processing:** The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the program efficiently checks for the existence of required indices within the specified range.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when the XOR of the entire subarray is `0` and when no valid splits exist.

Given these points, the program appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
