To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot know its exact behavior. However, we can assume that `func_1()` could potentially modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables.

Without knowing the definition of `func_1()`, we can only make assumptions based on typical scenarios. Let's consider a few possibilities:

1. `func_1()` might not modify `t` and might not introduce any new variables.
2. `func_1()` might modify `t` but not introduce any new variables.
3. `func_1()` might introduce new variables but not modify `t`.
4. `func_1()` might both modify `t` and introduce new variables.

Since the problem doesn't specify the behavior of `func_1()`, we'll assume the simplest scenario where `func_1()` does not modify `t` and does not introduce any new variables.

Given this assumption, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4**.
