You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and two additional integers. For each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in the first list contain at least `k` elements that also appear in the second list. It then prints the count of such subarrays for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
- We need to find the number of subarrays (subsegments) of length `m` in array `a` that contain at least `k` elements that can be matched with elements in array `b`.
- A subarray is considered "good" if it can be rearranged to have at least `k` elements that match the elements of `b`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a counter array `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1` (where `max_val` is 1,000,000) to keep track of the counts of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It populates `cnt_b` with the counts of elements from `b`.
   - It creates a set `b_values` from `b` for quick lookup.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `curr` to count the number of elements in the current window that match elements in `b`.
   - For the first window (indices 0 to m-1), it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is at least `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - For each subsequent window (from index 1 to n-m), it slides the window one element to the right.
   - It updates `cnt_b` and `curr` by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window.
   - If `curr` is at least `k` after the update, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for a test case, it prints the number of good subarrays `ans`.
   - It resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the next test case.

### Correctness Verification
- The sliding window technique ensures that each subarray of length `m` is checked efficiently.
- The use of `cnt_b` and `b_values` allows for efficient counting and checking of matching elements.
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion
The program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement and handles the constraints efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
