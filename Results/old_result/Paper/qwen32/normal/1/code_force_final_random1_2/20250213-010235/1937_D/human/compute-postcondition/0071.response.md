Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `l` is 0
- `r` is 4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `a` is 0
- `x` is 2
- `b` is 0
- `l` is less than `r`
- `x` is greater than or equal to 0

Code Snippet:
```python
b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `r` is 4
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `l` is 0
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet. Since `s[i]` is `'>'`, we can infer that `i` is an index related to the string `s`, but its exact value is not given. However, since `i` is used in the calculation and no specific value is provided, we assume it is a known value in the context of the program.

Let's calculate the value of `b`:
- `idx_B[r - 1]` translates to `idx_B[4 - 1]` which is `idx_B[3]` and equals `0`.
- `(l + 1)` translates to `(0 + 1)` which equals `1`.

Thus, `b` is calculated as:
```python
b = (0 - i) * 1
```
which simplifies to:
```python
b = -i
```

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we express `b` in terms of `i`.

The output state is:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `l` is 0
- `r` is 4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `a` is 0
- `x` is 2
- `b` is `-i`
- `l` is less than `r`
- `x` is greater than or equal to 0

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 4, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a` is 0, `x` is 2, `b` is `-i`, `l` is less than `r`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**
