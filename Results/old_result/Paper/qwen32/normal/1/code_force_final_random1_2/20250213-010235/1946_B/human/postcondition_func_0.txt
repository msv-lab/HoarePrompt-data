The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the given integers `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers. It computes a result that involves the maximum subarray sum adjusted by a factor of `2^k` minus the original maximum subarray sum, adds the total sum of the list `a`, and ensures the result is within the bounds of modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The result for each test case is printed.
