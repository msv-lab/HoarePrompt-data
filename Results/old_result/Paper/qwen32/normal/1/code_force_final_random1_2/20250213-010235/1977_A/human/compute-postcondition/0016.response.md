The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but none of these affect the content of the `print` statement directly. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are described, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, which means it will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Both `m` and `n` are odd integers.

Despite these conditions and variable definitions, the `print('Yes')` statement will simply output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
