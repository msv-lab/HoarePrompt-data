The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the initial values of `a` and `b` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

The variables `t`, `results`, and `winner` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

In simpler terms, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from the input, while the values of `t`, `results`, and `winner` remain the same as they were before.
