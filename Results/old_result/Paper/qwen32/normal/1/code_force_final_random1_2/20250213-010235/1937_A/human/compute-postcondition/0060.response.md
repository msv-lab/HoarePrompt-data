To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is the number of test cases to process.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n_cases - 1`:
     - Read an integer `n`.
     - If `n` is 1, print 1.
     - Otherwise, compute `power` as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\), and print \(2^{\text{power}}\).

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the following will be true:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged because it is used only to control the loop's execution count.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n_cases` after the loop completes.
- The variables `n` and `power` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, but these are not relevant to the overall output state since they are reinitialized in each iteration.

### Output State Description:
- `t` retains its initial value.
- `n_cases` retains its initial value.
- `i` is equal to `n_cases` after the loop has processed all test cases.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is the integer representing the number of test cases, and `i` is equal to `n_cases`.**
