Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This indicates the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not affect the immediate print statement.
- `a` is the first integer read from the input. Its specific value is not provided.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input. Its specific value is also not provided.
- `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. The value of `i` before this operation is not specified, but after this operation, `i` is incremented by 1.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **yes**
