The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `ans` or `y`. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Given that `ans` is being updated, and no other variables are mentioned as being modified, the output state will reflect this change while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, containing at least one element; `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even; `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`; `ans` is increased by `2 * y`.**
