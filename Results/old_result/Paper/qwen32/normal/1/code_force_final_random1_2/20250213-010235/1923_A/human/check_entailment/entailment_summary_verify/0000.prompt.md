You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s). For each test case, it calculates the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of the integer 1 in the list and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of operations needed to move chips in such a way that they form a single block without any free cells between them. Here's the program again for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the cells `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first chip in the array.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the last chip in the array by reversing the array and finding the first '1', then converting it back to the original index using `n - y`.

3. **Calculating the Subarray:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This creates a subarray from the first chip to the last chip.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of free cells ('0') in the subarray `z`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed.

### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Chips Together:** If all chips are already together, the program should output `0`. This seems to be handled correctly.
   - **Single Chip:** If there is only one chip, the program should output `0`. This also seems to be handled correctly.
   - **Chips at Ends:** If chips are at the ends and the middle is free, the program should correctly count the free cells in between. This seems to be handled correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The main issue arises when the chips are not contiguous and there are multiple blocks of chips. The current logic only considers the first and last chip and counts the free cells in between. However, this might not be the optimal solution if there are other configurations that require fewer moves.

### Counterexample

Consider the following test case:
```
1
9
0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
```

- The first chip is at index `1`.
- The last chip is at index `8`.
- The subarray `z` would be `arr[1:9-8]` which is `arr[1:1]` and results in an empty string, leading to `0` free cells counted.
- However, the optimal solution would be to move the chips to form a block, which requires `3` moves:
  - Move the chip at index `7` to index `5`.
  - Move the chip at index `8` to index `5`.
  - Move the chip at index `1` to index `3`.

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the counterexample, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where chips are not contiguous and require more than just moving the first and last chips together.
