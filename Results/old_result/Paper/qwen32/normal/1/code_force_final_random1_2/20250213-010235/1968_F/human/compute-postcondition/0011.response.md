The code snippet creates a new list `pf` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, or `a`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
