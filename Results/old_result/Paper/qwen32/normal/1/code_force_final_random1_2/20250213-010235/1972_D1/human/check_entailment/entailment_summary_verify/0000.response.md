### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues systematically using the function summaries and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The key function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15`. Here is its implementation:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_16` indicates that it calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result. This aligns with the problem statement, which requires printing the number of valid pairs for each test case.

#### Issues with `func_15`:
1. **Logic Mismatch**: The loop `while i * i <= n + i:` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not correspond to checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the required condition. Instead, it performs a different mathematical operation that is unrelated to the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        n, m = func_7()
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This corrected version ensures that all pairs \((a, b)\) are checked against the given condition, thus providing the correct result.

#### Conclusion:
Given that the provided function `func_15` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
