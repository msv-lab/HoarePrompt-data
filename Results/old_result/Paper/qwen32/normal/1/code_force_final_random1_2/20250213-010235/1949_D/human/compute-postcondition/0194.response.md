The code appends the character 'S' to the variable `nx`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[6][5]` remain unchanged. The only change is that `nx` now includes 'S' appended to its previous value.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 7, `j` is 7, `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[6][5]` with 'S' appended to it.**
