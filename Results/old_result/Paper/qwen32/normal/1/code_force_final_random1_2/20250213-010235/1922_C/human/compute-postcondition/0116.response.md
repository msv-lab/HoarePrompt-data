The given code snippet only initializes `d2` as a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. This means that `d2` will now have a default value of 0 for any key that does not exist in it, and it will overwrite the previous `d2` dictionary.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m`, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific values from `d2[1]` to `d2[previous `n` - 1]` as they are reset), `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
