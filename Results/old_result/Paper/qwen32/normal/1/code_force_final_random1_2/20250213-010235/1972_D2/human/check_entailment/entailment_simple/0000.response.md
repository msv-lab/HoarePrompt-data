### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic against the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Here's what each does:

1. **`func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **`func_1()`**:
   - Reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - Iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to count valid pairs.
   - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime).
   - If they are coprime, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x+y)x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Prints the count of valid pairs.

#### Issues in the Code:
The main issue with the code is the logic used to count valid pairs. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the calculation of `cnt` do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the code does not properly check whether \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly:
\[ b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0 \]

However, this brute-force approach would be inefficient given the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)). A more efficient solution would require mathematical insights or optimizations, which are not present in the provided code.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
