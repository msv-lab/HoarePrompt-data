The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n_cases - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `n` is either 1 (if the original value of `n` was 1) or the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `n`. Additionally, `power` is either equal to `n` (if the initial condition `power == n` was true) or decreased by 1 (if the initial condition `power == n` was false).**
