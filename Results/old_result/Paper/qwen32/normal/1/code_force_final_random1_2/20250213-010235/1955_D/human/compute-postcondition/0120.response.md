Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `b_values` remains unchanged, `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` within the first `m` elements that are also in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`. Additionally, `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
