Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing a single element `0`; `c` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**

In simple terms, the variables `i` and `j` have been initialized to `0`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`) retain their initial values.
