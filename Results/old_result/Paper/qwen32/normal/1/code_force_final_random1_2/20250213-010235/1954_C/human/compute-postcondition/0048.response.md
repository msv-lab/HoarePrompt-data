Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `b` is a non-empty list of integers derived from the input with `b[0] == a[0]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
