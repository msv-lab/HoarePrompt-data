The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `t` and `v`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, and `t` and `v` are integers representing the type of constraint and its value, respectively.

After executing the code, the values of `t` and `v` will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is [], `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input.**
