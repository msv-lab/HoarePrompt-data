Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1 and other values calculated according to the loop logic, `m` is an integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\), `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. The loop has executed `m` times.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The variable `n` remains an integer where \(n \geq 2\).
- The variable `i` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `l` of integers remains unchanged from its initial state.
- The defaultdict `d1` retains its initial default integer value of 0 and any updates made based on the differences in the list `l`.
- The defaultdict `d2` retains its initial default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1, and any other updates made according to the loop logic.
- The variable `m` remains the same integer input from the user, indicating the total number of iterations.
- The variable `j` will be `m-1` after the loop completes all `m` iterations.
- The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input.
- For each iteration, if `y` is greater than `x`, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` or `d2[y] - d2[x]` is printed accordingly. Otherwise, the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` or `d1[y] - d1[x]` is printed if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
