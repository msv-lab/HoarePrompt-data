In this task, the loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. Since `_` is not used within the loop, it does not need to be adjusted.

However, the state of the program includes other variables like `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex`. These variables are not part of the loop head, so they should not be modified based on the loop head alone. But for the loop to execute one more time, the condition controlling the number of iterations must still be valid.

Given that the loop runs for `int(input())` times, the state of `t` (which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `n` (the input integer) are crucial for understanding how many iterations are left. However, since `t` is not directly related to the loop control and `n` is used within the loop body, we focus on ensuring the loop can run one more time based on the input.

Since the loop control is based on `int(input())`, we assume that the input has already been read and the loop is set to run a specific number of times. Therefore, the state of `t` and `n` does not change in terms of the loop control itself.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the end of the previous iteration regarding the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop, with `mex` being updated during the loop; `mex` is the minimum value encountered during the loop**.
