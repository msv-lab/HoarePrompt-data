Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what it will print based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the new string input by the user.
- `h` is the first two characters of the new string `s`.
- If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'.
- Otherwise, `h` is not equal to '00' and the integer value of `h` is either less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Extracting Substring (`s[2:]`)**:
   - `s[2:]` extracts the substring of `s` starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string.
   
2. **Determining Time Format (`['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`)**:
   - `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`).
   - This boolean value is used to index into the list `['AM', 'PM']`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, it selects `'PM'`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, it selects `'AM'`.

### Output Explanation:
- The first part of the output is the substring of `s` starting from the third character.
- The second part of the output is either `'AM'` or `'PM'` based on the value of `h`.

Given the conditions:
- If `h` is '00', it remains '00', and since `int('00') < 12`, it will select `'AM'`.
- If `h` is any other value between '01' and '11', it will also select `'AM'`.
- If `h` is any value between '12' and '23', it will select `'PM'`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the substring of `s` starting from the third character followed by either `'AM'` or `'PM'` based on the value of `h`.

Output: **s[2:] AM/PM (where s[2:] is the substring of s starting from the third character and AM/PM is determined by whether the integer value of the first two characters of s is less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12)**
