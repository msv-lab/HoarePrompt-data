Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output).
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `X`:**  
   `X` is calculated as `A // 2`. This means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, effectively taking the floor of `A / 2`.

2. **Expression `X * C + B`:**  
   - First, multiply `X` by `C`.
   - Then, add `B` to the result of the multiplication.

### Final Expression:
The expression `X * C + B` can be described as:
\[ \text{Output} = \left(\frac{A}{2}\right) \times C + B \]
Where \(\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\) is the integer division of `A` by 2.

### Output Description:
The code will print the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are positive integers read from the input)**
