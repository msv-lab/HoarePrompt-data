To determine the new value of `b` after executing the given line of code, we need to consider the current state of the variables and apply the operations specified.

Given:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is not less than `r`
- `r` is not equal to `0`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `b` is updated based on the condition `l - r > 0`:
  - If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `(7 - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.
  - Otherwise, `b` remains `7`.

After the above update, the line of code modifies `b` further:
```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
```

Let's denote the value of `b` after the conditional update as `b_initial`. The new value of `b` will be:
\[ b_{\text{new}} = b_{\text{initial}} + (i - \text{idx\_A}[l - 1]) * r \]

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `i` are not specified, we can only express the final value of `b` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`; `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`; `l` is not less than `r`; `r` is not equal to `0`; `n` is greater than `0`; `s[i]` is `'>'`; `b` is `b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
