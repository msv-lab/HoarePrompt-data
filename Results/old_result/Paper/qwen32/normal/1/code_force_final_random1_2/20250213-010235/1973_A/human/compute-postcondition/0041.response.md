The code snippet simply appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state except `resultats`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed); `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, `resultats` includes `-1` as its last element; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`; `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element.**
