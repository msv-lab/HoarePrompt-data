Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` has been incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise all elements have been incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where `b[j]` is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S' (since it was already incremented by 1 in the initial state), `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string, and `x` is a string read from the input. `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
