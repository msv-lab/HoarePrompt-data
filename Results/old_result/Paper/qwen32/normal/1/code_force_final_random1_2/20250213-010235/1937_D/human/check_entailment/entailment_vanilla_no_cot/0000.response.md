Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains logical errors and does not correctly compute the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query. The logic for handling the inversion of characters and calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Additionally, the function `func_1` does not return any values, and the main loop does not capture or use the results of `func_1`. The program also lacks proper handling of edge cases and does not ensure that the pinball's movement and grid exit conditions are accurately simulated.

To correctly solve this problem, a more straightforward approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position while keeping track of the changes in the grid. This would require careful management of the grid state and ensuring that the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters are correctly handled for each step.
