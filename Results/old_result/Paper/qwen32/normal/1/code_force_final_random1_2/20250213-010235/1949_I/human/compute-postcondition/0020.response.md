The code snippet simply sets the variable `bipartite` to `True`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[i]` which is `False` and will be updated, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` which is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. The current index `i` has not been visited (`not visited[i]`).**
