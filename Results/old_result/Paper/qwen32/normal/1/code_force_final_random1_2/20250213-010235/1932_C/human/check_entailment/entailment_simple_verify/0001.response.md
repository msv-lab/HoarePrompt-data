### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a` of length `n`, and the string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the commands in the string `s` and constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - The annotations correctly state that `b` will contain all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`.

3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - The program then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and stores these products modulo `m` in the list `ans`.
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program after this step.

4. **Returning Results:**
   - The function returns `reversed(ans)`, ensuring the remainders are output in the correct order.

### Issues Identified:

- **Misinterpretation of the Problem Statement:**
  - The core issue is that the program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, which does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of `a` before each removal.
  - The problem requires the product of the current state of `a` before each element is removed, not the product of the elements collected in `b` in reverse order.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the product of the current state of `a` before each removal. This can be achieved by recalculating the product after each removal, or by maintaining a running product and adjusting it using modular inverses (if applicable).

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[l] using modular inverse
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[r] using modular inverse
            r -= 1
    return ans
```

However, the modular inverse approach requires `m` to be prime or coprime with the elements of `a`. A simpler and more robust approach is to recalculate the product after each removal:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order instead of the product of the current state of `a` before each removal.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
