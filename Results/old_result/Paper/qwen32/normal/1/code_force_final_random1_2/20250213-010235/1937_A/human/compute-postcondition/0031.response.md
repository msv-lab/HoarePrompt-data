To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `power < n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `power` is 3

For the loop to execute again, the condition `power < n` must be true. Since `power` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 to satisfy the condition.

No other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be modified to ensure that `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3**
