Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is set to `len(a)`, meaning `i` is the length of the list `a`.
- `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`.
- `new` is a list of integers where each element `new[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Since `i` is the length of `a`, `new` is essentially a copy of `a`.
- `new2` is a list of integers where each element `new2[j]` is equal to `a[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Similarly, `new2` is also a copy of `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement uses a generator expression within the `join` method to convert each element of the list `new2` into a string and then concatenates these strings together.
- Since `new2` is a copy of `a`, the elements of `new2` are the same as the elements of `a`.
- Therefore, the `join` method will concatenate the string representations of the elements of `a` without any separators.

### Final Output:
The output will be a single string that is the concatenation of the string representations of all the integers in the list `a`.

Output: **the concatenated string of all elements in list `a` (where each element is converted to a string and concatenated without separators)**

To make it more concrete, if `a` were `[1, 2, 3]`, the output would be `"123"`. But since the exact list `a` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of `a`.

Output: **the concatenated string of all elements in list `a` (where each element is converted to a string and concatenated without separators)**
