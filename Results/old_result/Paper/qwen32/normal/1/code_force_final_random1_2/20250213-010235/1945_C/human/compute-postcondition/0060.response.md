Postcondition: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem` if `final` did not already contain it, otherwise `final` contains its previous elements plus `elem`. If `abs(pk - elem) != mini`, `final` remains unchanged. `lst` has at least one element; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
