The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is from `1` to `n + 1`. To ensure that the loop executes, `n` must be at least `1` because if `n` is `0`, the range `(1, 1)` would result in an empty sequence, and the loop would not execute.

Given this, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is at least `1`. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is `{0: [0]}`**
