The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` had some value (let's call it `i_prev`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `i` was at its last valid value before the loop ended. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, let's assume the simplest case where `i` was at its initial value of 0 at the start of the first iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 1.

State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1**
