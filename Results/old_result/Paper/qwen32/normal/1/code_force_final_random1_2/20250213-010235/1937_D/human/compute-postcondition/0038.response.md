The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `i`, `s[i]`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is not empty and now includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `s[i]` is `<`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`**.
