Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is `i + 1` (This suggests that `i` was previously defined and is being incremented by 1).
- `n` is the first integer read from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the new input.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
