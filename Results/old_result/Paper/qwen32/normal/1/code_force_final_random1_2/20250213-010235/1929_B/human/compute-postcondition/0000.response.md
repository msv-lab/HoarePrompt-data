The code snippet provided only reads the first integer input which represents the number of test cases, `t`. It does not process any further inputs or perform any operations related to `n` and `k` yet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `k` where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 4`n` - 2.**
This means that the value of `t` has been updated to the integer read from the input, while the conditions and descriptions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are part of the problem description for subsequent inputs.
