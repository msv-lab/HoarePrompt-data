Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m-1` are integers obtained from the input, where `m-1` must be greater than or equal to 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` has been updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
