Let's analyze the given `for` loop and determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the next iteration.

Given `for` loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable is `i`.
- The range function generates numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

### Given State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, let's denote it as `i_end`.
- `n` is a constant or a variable that determines the upper limit of the loop.

### Determining the Next State:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.
- For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be within the range `[1, n]`.

### Conclusion:
- If `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

### Example Adjustment:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 5, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 6. The value of `n` must be such that `n >= 6` for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i_end + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can express the state in terms of `i_end`:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i_end + 1`**

However, if we assume `i_end` to be the specific value provided in the state (e.g., `i` is 5), then:

State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**

For the general case without specific values:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i_end + 1`**

Since the problem doesn't provide a specific `i_end`, we'll use the general form:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i_end + 1`**

But if we assume `i_end` to be the last known value of `i` (from the example), let's say `i` was 5:

State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**

For the sake of providing a concrete example:

State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6**
