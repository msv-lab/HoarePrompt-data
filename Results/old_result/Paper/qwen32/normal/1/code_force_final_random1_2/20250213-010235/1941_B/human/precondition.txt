t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains an integer n such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
