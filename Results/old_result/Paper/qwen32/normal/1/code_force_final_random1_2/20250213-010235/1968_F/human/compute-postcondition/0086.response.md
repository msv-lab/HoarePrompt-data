The code snippet `results.append('')` appends an empty string to the `results` list. This means that the length of the `results` list increases by one, and the new element is an empty string.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q`.
- `results` is a list of `q` elements each being 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `q` is 0.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
- `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears.

After executing the code, the only change is that `results` now contains one more element, which is an empty string. Since `q` was initially 0, `results` was initially an empty list, and now it contains one element, which is an empty string. Therefore, the updated `results` list can be described as having one element, which is an empty string.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears.**
