Postcondition: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, and `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[6][5]`. Specifically, if `xx[6][5]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is increased by `xx[6][5]`. Otherwise, `nx` has either 'F' or 'S' appended to it, depending on whether `i` or `j` is found in the first quarter of the list `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`). If `i` or `j` is found in `sa[:n // 4]`, 'F' is appended; otherwise, 'S' is appended.**
