Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `original_cur + 2^cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cnt` is increased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cur`) retain their previous values.
