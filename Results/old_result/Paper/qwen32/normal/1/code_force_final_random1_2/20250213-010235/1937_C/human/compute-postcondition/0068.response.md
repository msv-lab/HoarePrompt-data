The code snippet reads a new input and assigns it to the variable `res`. This changes the value of `res` from its initial state to whatever the new input is. The values of `t`, `n`, `best`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, if the new `res` equals '<', then `best` is set to the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) where the response was '<'. If the new `res` does not equal '<', `best` remains 0, `i` is 2**.
