Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- Initial State:
  - `t` is set to 1.
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
  - `a` is an input string.
  - `b` is an input string.
  - `i` is set to 3.

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  print('No')
  ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'No'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are used in this specific print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Based on the provided information and the code, the output will be:

Output: **No**
