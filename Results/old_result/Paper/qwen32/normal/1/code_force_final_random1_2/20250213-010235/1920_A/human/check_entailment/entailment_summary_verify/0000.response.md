### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.
- Constraints can be of three types:
  1. `k` must be greater than or equal to some integer `x`.
  2. `k` must be less than or equal to some integer `x`.
  3. `k` must not be equal to some integer `x`.
- There will be at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
- The solution should handle up to 500 test cases, each with up to 100 constraints.

#### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads input and processes each test case as follows:
1. It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.
2. For each constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to a list `num`.
3. After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.
4. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 (indicating no valid `k`).

#### Evaluation Against Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_7()`:
- It reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`.
- It updates `start` and `end` based on constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively.
- It collects values of type 3 into a list `num`.
- It calculates the number of integers within the range `[start, end]` that are not in `num` and returns this count if it is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.

#### Testing with Example Inputs:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs.

#### Test Case 1:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- `start` becomes 3.
- `end` becomes 10.
- `num` becomes [1, 5].
- Valid `k` values: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
- Output: 7 (correct).

#### Test Case 2:
```
2
1 5
2 4
```
- `start` becomes 5.
- `end` becomes 4.
- Output: 0 (correct).

#### Test Case 3:
```
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
- `start` becomes 7.
- `end` becomes 98.
- `num` becomes [6, 7, 100, 44, 99].
- Valid `k` values: 34, 35, ..., 98 (excluding 6, 7, 99).
- Output: 90 (correct).

#### Test Case 4:
```
6
1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
- `start` becomes 9.
- `end` becomes 2.
- Output: 0 (correct).

#### Test Case 5:
```
5
1 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3
```
- `start` becomes 1.
- `end` becomes 2.
- `num` becomes [1, 2, 3].
- Valid `k` values: none.
- Output: 0 (correct).

#### Test Case 6:
```
6
1 10000
2 900000000
3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
- `start` becomes 100000000.
- `end` becomes 900000000.
- `num` becomes [500000000, 10000, 900000001].
- Valid `k` values: 100000000, 100000001, ..., 900000000 (excluding 500000000, 10000).
- Output: 800000000 (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases. It correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, including edge cases where no valid `k` exists.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
