Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`; `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`; `l` is not less than `r`; `r` is not equal to `0`; `n` is greater than `0`; `s[i]` is `'>'`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `(7 - A[l - r - 1]) - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `7`.**
