The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the variable `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. This means the original value of `n` is replaced by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `score`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1) from `l`, `i` is 2*(n-1)**.
