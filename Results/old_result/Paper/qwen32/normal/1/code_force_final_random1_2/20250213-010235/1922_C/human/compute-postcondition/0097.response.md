To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `n` is greater than 2.
4. `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `d1` is a `defaultdict` with keys from 2 to `n` and values updated based on certain conditions within a loop.
6. `d2` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on certain conditions within a loop.
7. `m` is greater than 0.
8. `j` is set to `m-1`.
9. `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input, with `y` being greater than `x`.

Given these conditions, the specific values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` depend on how `d1` is updated within the loop. Since the exact updates to `d1` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these values.

The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` calculates the difference between the values stored in `d1` at keys `y` and `x`.

Thus, the output will be the result of this difference, which is dependent on the specific values assigned to `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` during the execution of the loop.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[x] and d1[y] are the values in the defaultdict d1 at keys x and y respectively, updated based on the conditions in the loop)**
