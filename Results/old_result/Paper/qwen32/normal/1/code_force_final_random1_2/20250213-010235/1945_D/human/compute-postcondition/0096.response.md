The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. Since the initial state already defines `na_frente` and `pos_final` as the first and second integers from the input minus 1, the new assignments will overwrite these values.

Here's the updated state:

- `na_frente` is now the first integer from the input (not the first integer from the input minus 1).
- `pos_final` is now the second integer from the input (not the second integer from the input minus 1).

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `total` is the accumulated sum of the smallest costs, `best` is the minimum cost found when `v <= pos_final`**.
