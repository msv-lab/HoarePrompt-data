The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `a` was already assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` will now hold the same value as `a`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
