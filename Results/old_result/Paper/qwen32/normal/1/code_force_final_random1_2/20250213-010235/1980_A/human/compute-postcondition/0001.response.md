The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is an empty list.**
