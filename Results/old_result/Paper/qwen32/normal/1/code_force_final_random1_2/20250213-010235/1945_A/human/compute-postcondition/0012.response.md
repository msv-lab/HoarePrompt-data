To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and what the final state of the variables will be after processing all `t` test cases.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop reads `t` test cases from the input.
- For each test case, it reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It updates `b` by adding `c` to it (`b += c`).
- It then computes and prints the result of the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.

### Expression Breakdown:
- The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` can be broken down as follows:
  - `-b // 3` computes the integer division of `-b` by 3.
  - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` (since subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding a positive).
  - The tuple `(a + b // 3, -1)` is indexed by the boolean result of `c < b % 3`.
  - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the result is `-1`.
  - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the result is `a + b // 3`.

### Final Output State:
After processing all `t` test cases, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the values of the last test case processed. However, since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the final state of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those of the last test case read from the input.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be determined by the last test case processed. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case, and `t` will remain unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is the integer from the last test case, `b` is the sum of the second and third integers from the last test case, and `c` is the third integer from the last test case.**
