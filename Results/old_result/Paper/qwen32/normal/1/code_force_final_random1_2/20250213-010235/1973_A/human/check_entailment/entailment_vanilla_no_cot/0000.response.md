Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Test Cases**: The `cas_de_test` list includes `(0, 2, 3)` which does not meet the condition `p1 <= p2 <= p3`. This should be corrected to ensure all test cases adhere to the problem constraints.

2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of draws (`egalites`) is flawed. The current formula does not correctly account for the distribution of wins and losses among the players.
   - The check `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is too restrictive. For instance, if `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are all 3, it would incorrectly return `-1` because `total_matchs` would be 3, but it is possible to have 3 matches with no draws and each player winning one match.

3. **Handling Draws**:
   - The program does not properly handle scenarios where the maximum number of draws can be achieved while still respecting the scores of the players.
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly compute the maximum number of draws. It should consider the possibility of different match outcomes leading to the given scores.

Here is a corrected version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matches = total_points // 2
        
        # Check if the scores are achievable
        if p3 > total_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = min(total_matches - (p3 - p2), total_matches - (p3 - p1), (p2 - p1))
        
        # Verify if the calculated draws are feasible
        if p1 + 2 * max_draws == p2 and p2 + 2 * max_draws == p3:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
        else:
            resultats.append(-1)
    
    return resultats

# Example usage
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

This corrected function ensures that the scores are achievable and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
