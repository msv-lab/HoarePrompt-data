To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is the new input integer for each test case. It indicates the number of elements in the list `l`.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input. The list `l` contains `n` integers and is sorted in ascending order.
- `score` is the sum of elements at even indices of `l`. This means we sum up the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index that is less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(score)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(score)` statement will output the value of `score`, which is the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `l`.

Given that `l` is a sorted list of integers and `score` is explicitly defined as the sum of elements at even indices, we can describe the output as follows:

- `score` is computed by summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list `l`.
- Since `l` is sorted, the elements at even indices are specific elements from this sorted list.

However, without knowing the exact elements of `l` for a given input, we cannot provide a numerical value for `score`. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of the definition of `score`.

### Final Output:
Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `l`)**
