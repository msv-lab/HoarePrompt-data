To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved in the statement:

1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `time`: This is calculated as `current_time + 1`. Since `current_time` is not explicitly mentioned, we can denote it as `current_time` and thus `time` would be `current_time + 1`.
   - `player`: This variable is determined based on the condition `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, then `player` is `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Understanding `obj` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`:**
   - `obj` is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, where `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, and `mov` is presumably a dictionary mapping commands to movement vectors.
   - Therefore, `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` refers to the element in the `grid` at the position calculated by moving from `obj`'s current position according to the command `com`.

3. **Determining the Value of `player`:**
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, `player` is simply `obj`.
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` is `False`, `player` is the element in the `grid` at the new position `nxt`.

Given these points, the output of the `print` statement will depend on the specific values of `current_time`, `obj`, `com`, `elements`, `grid`, and the result of `isPlayer(obj)`.

Since we do not have the exact values of these variables, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables:

- `time` is `current_time + 1`.
- `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `False`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **current_time + 1 player (where player is obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, otherwise player is grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
