The given code snippet assigns a value to the variable `tmp` based on the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is 4, the calculation `chr(ord('a') + i)` translates to `chr(ord('a') + 4)`, which results in `chr(97 + 4)`, and thus `chr(101)`, which is the character `'e'`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0, `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `i` is 4; `tmp` is 'e'**.

This means that the only variable that has changed is `tmp`, which now holds the value `'e'`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
