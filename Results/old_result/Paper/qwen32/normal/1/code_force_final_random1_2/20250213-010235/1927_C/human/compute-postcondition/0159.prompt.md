Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of `aOnes` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`. `t` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `newk` is `k // 2`. `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` is 0. Similarly, `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `bOnes` is 0. `t` has been incremented by 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input. `a` and `b` retain their input values. `newk` is `k // 2`. `i` is 2. `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, `t` has been incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input where `k` must be at least 2, `a` and `b` retain their input values, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, `t` has been incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input where `k` must be at least 3, `a` and `b` retain their input values, and `newk` is `k // 2`. `i` is 4.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
