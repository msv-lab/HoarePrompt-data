Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars` before the operation, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `unique_chars` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` was not in `unique_chars` before the operation, `s` remains unchanged except that `char` is inserted at index `i` in `unique_chars`, making it potentially unsorted, `i` is increased to 1, and `j` is updated to `len(unique_chars)`. `char` is the next element in the list `s`.**
