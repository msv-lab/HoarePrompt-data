Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; additionally, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`); `impossible` is `True`. At least one of the following conditions holds: the character at position `j` in the first row (`gr[0][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the first row (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the character at position `j` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`).**
