Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings), `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (i.e., `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If the first character of the `i`-th string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr` or the last character of the `i`-th string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr`, then `impossible` is `False`; otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`.**

In simple terms, the variable `impossible` has been set to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
