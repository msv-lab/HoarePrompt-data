Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not properly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters in the grid. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Character Inversion**: The problem states that after the pinball moves to a cell, the character in that cell should be inverted. However, the provided code does not perform this inversion. This means that the behavior of the pinball after its first move is incorrect because the grid configuration remains unchanged.

2. **Movement Logic**: The provided code uses complex calculations involving lists `A` and `B` and their indices `idx_A` and `idx_B`. These calculations seem to be an attempt to precompute some values for efficiency, but they do not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the subsequent inversions of characters.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as grids with only one cell or grids where all characters are the same (either all '<' or all '>'). For example, if the grid is "<", the pinball should move left and leave the grid in 1 second. Similarly, if the grid is ">", the pinball should move right and leave the grid in 1 second. The provided code does not handle these simple cases correctly.

4. **Output Format**: The code prints the results for each query without separating them properly. Each test case's results should be printed on a new line, but the provided code does not ensure this.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def simulate_pinball(grid, n):
    results = []
    for start in range(n):
        position = start
        time = 0
        visited = set()
        while 0 <= position < n:
            if position in visited:
                break  # To prevent infinite loops in case of cycles
            visited.add(position)
            direction = grid[position]
            if direction == '<':
                position -= 1
            else:
                position += 1
            time += 1
            # Invert the character
            grid[start] = '>' if grid[start] == '<' else '<'
        results.append(time)
    return results

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(input().strip())  # Convert string to list for mutability
    results = simulate_pinball(s, n)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This corrected code simulates the pinball's movement step-by-step, inverts the character in the starting cell after each move, and ensures that the results for each test case are printed on a new line.
