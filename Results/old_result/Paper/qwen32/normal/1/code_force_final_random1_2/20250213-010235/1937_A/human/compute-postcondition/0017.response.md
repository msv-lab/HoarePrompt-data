Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is log2(original value of n), `power` is equal to n, and `power` is not equal to `n`** 

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the provided information because if `power` is defined as being equal to `n`, then the condition `power == n` would always be true, and the else block would never be entered. Assuming the intention was to check some other condition or that there might be a misunderstanding, let's consider a corrected version where `power` could potentially not equal `n`:

If we assume the intention was to check some other condition but `power` is still defined as `n`, then the postcondition should reflect the state where the specific condition that would make the if-statement false is met. Since the if-statement checks `power == n` and `power` is defined as `n`, the else block would not logically be entered under the given definitions. However, if we consider a scenario where `power` might not be strictly equal due to some external factor or previous computation, the postcondition could be:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is log2(original value of n), and `power` is not equal to `n`**

Given the original setup, this seems to be the most logical interpretation where the if-condition is negated.
