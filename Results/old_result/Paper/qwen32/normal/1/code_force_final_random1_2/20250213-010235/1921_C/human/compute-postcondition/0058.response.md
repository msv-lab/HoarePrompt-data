Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is an empty list, and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**
