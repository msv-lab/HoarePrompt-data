The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which are then assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. This means `custo_pra_trocar_a` now holds a list of integers.

Other variables (`t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers read from the input; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
