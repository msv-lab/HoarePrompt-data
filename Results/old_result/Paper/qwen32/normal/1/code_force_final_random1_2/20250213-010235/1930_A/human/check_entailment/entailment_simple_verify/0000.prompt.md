You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} contains exactly 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: The final `score` is the sum of the scores from all `t` test cases, where each score is the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `l` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `2n` positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform `n` moves.
- Each move involves choosing two integers `x` and `y`, adding `min(x, y)` to the score, and erasing `x` and `y`.
- Our goal is to maximize the final score after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program sorts the list of integers and then sums up every other element starting from the first element. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read `n` (number of pairs).
   - Read the list of `2n` integers.
   - Sort the list.
   - Initialize `score` to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted list, adding every other element (starting from the first element) to the score.
   - Print the final score.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that this strategy always yields the maximum possible score. The optimal strategy here is to pair the smallest available numbers together because adding the smaller number in each pair maximizes the total sum of the minimums.

#### Why Sorting Works:
- By sorting the list, the smallest numbers are paired together.
- This ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible values to the score, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- **Single Pair Case**: When `n=1`, the program correctly picks the smaller of the two numbers.
- **All Identical Numbers**: When all numbers are the same, the program correctly adds the same number `n` times.
- **Varying Numbers**: The program consistently pairs the smallest numbers, ensuring the maximum score.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the strategy used in the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the optimal solution for every potential case. The program handles different scenarios effectively, including edge cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the list of integers and sums every other element starting from the first element, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always adding the smallest possible values. This approach works for all edge cases and varying inputs within the problem constraints.
