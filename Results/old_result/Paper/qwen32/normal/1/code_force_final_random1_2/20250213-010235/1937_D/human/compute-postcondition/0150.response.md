To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step-by-step based on the provided initial state:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
   - `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
   - `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
   - `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
   - `n` is greater than 0 (specific value not provided, but it's a positive integer)
   - `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', but since `i` is 1, the specific value of `s[1]` is not relevant to this calculation.
   - `i` is 1
   - `r` is decreased by 1, but `r` is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant here.

2. **Expression to evaluate:**
   ```
   n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2
   ```

3. **Identifying the unknowns:**
   - `n` is a positive integer but its specific value is not given.
   - `l` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it's provided or infer it from context. Since it's not specified, let's assume `l` is a valid index for `idx_A`.

4. **Assuming `l` is a valid index:**
   - Let's assume `l` is 1 for simplicity (since no other information is provided about `l`).

5. **Substituting the values:**
   - `i = 1`
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` where `l = 1`, so `idx_A[0]` which is `3`.
   - Substituting these into the expression:
     ```
     n - 1 + (1 - 3) * 2
     ```

6. **Simplifying the expression:**
   - `n - 1 + (-2) * 2`
   - `n - 1 - 4`
   - `n - 5`

Since `n` is not explicitly defined, the output will be in terms of `n`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **n - 5 (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
