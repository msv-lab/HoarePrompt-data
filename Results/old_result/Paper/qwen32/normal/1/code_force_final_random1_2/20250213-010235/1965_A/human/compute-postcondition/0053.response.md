To determine what will be printed by the `print('Alice')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `test` is `True`.
- `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`.
- `j` is even.

Given these conditions, the `print('Alice')` statement does not depend on any specific values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`, `j`, or any other variables directly. The statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Thus, the output of the `print('Alice')` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the provided conditions.

Output: **Alice**
