Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`, `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[2]` is greater than 0 if `start` is 2; `vis` is a set containing the values `0`, `1`, and `start`. The value of `nums[start]` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the frequency of the element `start` in the `nums` Counter object has been reduced by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
