The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged except for `nx`. Since `i` and `j` are incremented before this operation, the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is added to `nx`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`.**
