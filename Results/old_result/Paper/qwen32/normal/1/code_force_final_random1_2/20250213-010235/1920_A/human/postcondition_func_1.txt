The function reads an input line and processes it based on the boolean parameters `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, it splits the line into substrings separated by whitespace; if `space` is False, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer. If `to_int` is False, the elements remain as strings.
