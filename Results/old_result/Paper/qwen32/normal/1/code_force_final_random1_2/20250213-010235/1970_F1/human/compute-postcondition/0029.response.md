To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is `ind` in this case. The loop iterates over the indices of `line`, so `ind` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer.
- `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`.
- `ind` is `ind + 1`.

Since the loop increments `ind` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `ind` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer.
- `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`.
- `ind` is the current value of `ind` plus 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is `ind + 1`**.

However, to be precise about the increment, let's denote the value of `ind` at the end of the previous iteration as `ind_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ind` should be `ind_prev + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is `ind + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `ind` from the previous iteration, we can express the state as:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, if we assume `ind` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `ind` would be `x + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is `ind + 1`**.

This can be simplified to:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is incremented by 1**.

So the final answer is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is `ind + 1`**.
