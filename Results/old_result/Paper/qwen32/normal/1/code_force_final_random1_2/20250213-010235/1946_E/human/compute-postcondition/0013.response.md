Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple of two integers. The function computes and returns the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are the integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.**
