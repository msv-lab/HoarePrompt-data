The code provided reads a line of input, removes any whitespace from it, and assigns the resulting string to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.

Given that `arr` is derived from the input line with whitespace removed, its exact value depends on the user's input. However, since no further operations are specified on `arr` in the provided code snippet, we only need to indicate that `arr` now holds the concatenated string of the input without spaces.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, and the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1; `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed.**
