Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `y` and `tmp` are unchanged. If `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated by adding `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `y` is reduced by `((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`, and `tmp` includes the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` appended to it. Otherwise, `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
