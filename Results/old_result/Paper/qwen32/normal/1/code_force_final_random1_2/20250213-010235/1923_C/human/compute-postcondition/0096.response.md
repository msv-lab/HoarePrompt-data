Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n` and `m`: Integers where `m` is decremented by 1.
- `l`: A list of integers.
- `p`: A list of cumulative sums starting with 0.
- `c`: A list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0.
- `a` and `b`: Integers obtained from the current input.
- `s`: Calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `i`: Calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `j`: The count of 1s in the list `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string `'YES'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `j`) are used in this particular `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
