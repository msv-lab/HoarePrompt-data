Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `cnt_b` remains unchanged, `curr` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
