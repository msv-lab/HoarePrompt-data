Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`; `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`; `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `freq` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `missing` is 7 * m; `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case; `results` now includes the value of `missing` for the current test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`; `_` is incremented by 2 for each test case; `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from the current test case in `test_cases`; `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`; `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each frequency f in `freq`; `results` now includes the newly calculated `missing` value for the current test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
