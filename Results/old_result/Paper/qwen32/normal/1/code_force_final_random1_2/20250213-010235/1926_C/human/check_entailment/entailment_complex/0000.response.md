### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000. This allows it to quickly answer any query for a value of \( n \) within the specified range by simply looking up the precomputed result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Precomputation Phase:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each integer \( i \), it computes the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function.
   - It adds this digit sum to the cumulative `sum`.
   - It appends the current cumulative `sum` to the list `A`.

2. **Query Handling Phase:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It prints the value at index \( n-1 \) of the list `A`, which corresponds to the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( n \).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Precomputation:**
  - The `func_1` function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
  - The cumulative sum stored in `A` is correct because it accumulates the digit sums in the correct order.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Precomputing the cumulative sums for all numbers up to 200,000 takes a fixed amount of time and ensures that each query can be answered in constant time \( O(1) \).
  - Given the constraints (\( t \leq 10^4 \)), this approach is efficient and well within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The smallest possible input \( n = 1 \) is handled correctly since `A[0]` contains the sum of the digits of 1, which is 1.
  - The largest possible input \( n = 200,000 \) is also handled correctly since `A[199999]` contains the cumulative sum up to 200,000.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution by precomputing the required values and efficiently handling each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
