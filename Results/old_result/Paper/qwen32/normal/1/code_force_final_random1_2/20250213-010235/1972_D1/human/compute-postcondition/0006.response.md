To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()`. From the provided information, we know that `func_10()` determines the number of times the loop will execute, and `func_15()` provides the value that gets printed during each iteration.

The loop will execute `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, it prints a value returned by `func_15()`.

From the given output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to 3, as the loop executed at least three times. The loop will continue executing until the number of iterations specified by `func_10()` is reached.

Let's denote the value returned by `func_10()` as `k`. The loop will execute exactly `k` times. After all iterations, the output state will be that `func_15()` has been called `k` times, and its return values have been printed `k` times.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to `n` and `m` within the loop, they remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer from `func_15()` has been returned and printed `func_10()` times.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `n` and `m` retain their initial values, and the loop has printed the value returned by `func_15()` for the number of times specified by `func_10()`.
