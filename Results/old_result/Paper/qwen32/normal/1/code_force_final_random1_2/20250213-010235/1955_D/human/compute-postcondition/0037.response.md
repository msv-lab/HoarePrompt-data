To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we see that the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. However, the range function depends on `n` and `m`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n - m` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Range Condition**: For the loop to execute, `n - m` must be greater than 0, meaning `n > m`.
2. **Variable `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `m - 1`. This value doesn't directly affect the loop's execution but should be consistent with the loop's starting point.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n > m`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`); `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m-1`; `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` that were found in `b` and had non-negative counts in `cnt_b`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

This ensures that the loop can execute by making sure `n - m` is positive.
