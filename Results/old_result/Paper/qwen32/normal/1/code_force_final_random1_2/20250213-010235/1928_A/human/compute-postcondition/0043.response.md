Postcondition: **`t` is an integer that was initially read from input minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If `a` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`, provided `a1` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is odd, no changes are made to `a1` and `a2`. `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged regardless of whether `a` is even or odd.**
