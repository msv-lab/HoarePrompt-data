Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` including `allPlayers[obj]` which is now `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`, `time` is `current_time + 1`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `goalIn(pos) != -1`, then `team` is set to `None`.**
