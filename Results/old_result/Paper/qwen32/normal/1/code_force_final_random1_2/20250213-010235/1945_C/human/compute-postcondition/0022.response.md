The given code snippet calculates the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of the string `s` excluding the current character `s[i]`. Here's the updated state:

- `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000; if the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0; otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.
