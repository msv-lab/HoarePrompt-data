Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is equal to `n + int(g / count) + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is equal to `int(n / 3)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
