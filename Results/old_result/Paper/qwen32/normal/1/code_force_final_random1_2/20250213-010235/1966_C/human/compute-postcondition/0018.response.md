Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, `dp` is `True`, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, and `i` is `n-1` (based on the old value of `n`).**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that `dp` is now set to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
