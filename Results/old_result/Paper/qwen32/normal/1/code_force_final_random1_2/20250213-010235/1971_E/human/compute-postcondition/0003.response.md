The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and then creates a list `a` where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers from the input. 

Given the initial state, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input. After executing the code, `a` will be a list starting with `0` followed by the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input.**
