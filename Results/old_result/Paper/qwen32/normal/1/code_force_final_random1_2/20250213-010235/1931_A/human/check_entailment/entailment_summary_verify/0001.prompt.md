You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. It then generates and prints a specific string based on the value of `n` for each test case. The generated string is constructed using lowercase letters from the English alphabet according to predefined rules.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- We need to decode an integer `n` back into a 3-letter word such that the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet equals `n`.
- The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest possible word for each `n`.

### Program Analysis
The program uses the following logic to construct the word:
1. **If `n > 52`:**
   - It constructs the word by taking the letter at position `n - 53` and appending `'zz'` to it.
2. **Else if `n > 26`:**
   - It constructs the word by taking `'a'`, the letter at position `n - 28`, and appending `'z'` to it.
3. **Else (`n <= 26`):**
   - It constructs the word by taking `'aa'` and appending the letter at position `n - 3`.

### Checking the Logic
Let's verify the logic with some examples from the problem statement:

#### Example 1: `n = 24`
- According to the program:
  - Since `n <= 26`, it should use the third condition: `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'r'` resulting in `'aar'`.
- However, the expected output is `'aav'`. This means the program's logic is incorrect for this case.

#### Example 2: `n = 70`
- According to the program:
  - Since `n > 52`, it should use the first condition: `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'r' + 'zz'` resulting in `'rzz'`.
- The expected output is `'rzz'`. This part seems correct.

#### Example 3: `n = 3`
- According to the program:
  - Since `n <= 26`, it should use the third condition: `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'a'` resulting in `'aaa'`.
- The expected output is `'aaa'`. This part seems correct.

#### Example 4: `n = 55`
- According to the program:
  - Since `26 < n <= 52`, it should use the second condition: `'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'w' + 'z'` resulting in `'awz'`.
- The expected output is `'czz'`. This means the program's logic is incorrect for this case.

#### Example 5: `n = 48`
- According to the program:
  - Since `26 < n <= 52`, it should use the second condition: `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` resulting in `'auz'`.
- The expected output is `'auz'`. This part seems correct.

### Conclusion
From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for `n = 24` and `n = 55`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
