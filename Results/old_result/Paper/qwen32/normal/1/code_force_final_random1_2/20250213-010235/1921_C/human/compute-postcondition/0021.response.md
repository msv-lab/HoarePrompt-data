Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`test_cases`**: An integer that must be greater than or equal to 1. This seems redundant since `t` already represents the number of test cases.
3. **`feat`**: A list of integers obtained from the input where:
   - The first element `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
   - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
   - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
4. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the new input.
5. **`array2`**: A list containing the elements \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\) where \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < \frac{b}{a}\).
6. **Condition**: The sum of `array2` plus \((n - \text{len}(\text{array2})) * b\) is less than `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `arr`, `array2`, `f`, `a`, `b`, or any other variables. The `print` statement is unconditional and will always output `'Yes'` regardless of the input values or the calculations performed earlier in the program.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided initial state and the code snippet, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Yes**
