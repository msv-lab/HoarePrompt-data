The code snippet provided appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `n + 1`; `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'F' appended.**
