The code snippet initializes a new variable `idx_A` as an empty list. This does not affect the existing variables `s`, `n`, or `A`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `idx_A` as an empty list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s`, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.**
