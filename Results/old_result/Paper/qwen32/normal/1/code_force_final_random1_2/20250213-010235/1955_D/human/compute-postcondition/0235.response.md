Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 and `curr` is increased by 1.**
