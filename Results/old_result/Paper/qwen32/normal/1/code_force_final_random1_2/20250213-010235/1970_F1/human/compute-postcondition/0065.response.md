The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list at index `tmp` in the `goal` list. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[3][0]` is 'B' or not. Since `i` is 1 and `ind` is 3, the tuple `(1, 3)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[3]` mapped to `(1, 3)`, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if `line[3][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(1, 3)`**.
