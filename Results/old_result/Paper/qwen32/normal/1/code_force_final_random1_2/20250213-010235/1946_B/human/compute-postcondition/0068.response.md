Postcondition: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0], `sm` is calculated based on the final suf[n], `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is int(b[1]), `l` is a list of integers from the input, and `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`.**
