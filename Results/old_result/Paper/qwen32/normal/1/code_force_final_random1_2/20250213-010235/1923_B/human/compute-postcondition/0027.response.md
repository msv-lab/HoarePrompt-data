Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. `n` is the length of the list `a` (and `x`). `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`. `distance` is 0. `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1 and `rest` is updated to `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos-1]])` with `delta` being `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos-1]])`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not 0, `pos` remains unchanged.**
