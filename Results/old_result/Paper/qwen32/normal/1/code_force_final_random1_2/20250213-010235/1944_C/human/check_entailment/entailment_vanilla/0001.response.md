Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play a game on an array `a`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after all elements have been moved from `a` to `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it. Both players play optimally.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

### Key Observations

1. **Turn Order**: Alice and Bob take turns. Alice starts first.
2. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally.
3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of `c` at the end of the game needs to be determined.

### Strategy

- Alice will try to add numbers to `c` such that the MEX is maximized.
- Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving a high MEX by removing numbers strategically.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers starting from 0, adding them to `c` (represented by the `vis` set) and decrementing their counts in the `nums` counter. If the next consecutive number (`start + 1`) is also available, it adds that too. This process continues until a number cannot be added consecutively, at which point the current `start + 1` is printed as the MEX.

#### Steps in the Program

1. **Count Elements**: Use `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `a`.
2. **Iterate and Add**: Start from 0 and check if the current number (`start`) and the next number (`start + 1`) are available. If they are, add them to `c` and decrement their counts.
3. **Determine MEX**: When a number cannot be added consecutively, the current `start + 1` is the MEX.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX under the assumption that both players play optimally. Here's why:

- **Optimal Play Simulation**: By always trying to add the smallest available number and its consecutive number, the program effectively simulates the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is correctly calculated as the smallest number that cannot be consecutively added to `c`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
