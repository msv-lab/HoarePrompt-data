The code snippet increments the variable `j` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be the previous value of `j` plus 1.

Given the initial state, `j` was set to 1 if the next element in `l` is 1, otherwise `j` was set to 0. After executing `j += 1`, `j` will be either 2 (if it was 1) or 1 (if it was 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`]; `c` is [0, `j`]; `i` is `i + 1`; `j` is 1 if the previous `j` was 0, otherwise `j` is 2; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
