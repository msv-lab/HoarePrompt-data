Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple. `total_points` is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` is `[-1]`. Otherwise, if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is `[-1]`. If `total_points` is even and either `total_matchs > 3` or `p_3 > total_matchs`, `resultats` is `[-1]`. If none of these conditions are met, `resultats` is `[egalites // 2]`.**
