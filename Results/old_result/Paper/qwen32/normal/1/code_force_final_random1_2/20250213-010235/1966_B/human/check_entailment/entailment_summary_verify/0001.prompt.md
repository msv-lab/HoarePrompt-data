You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' and 'B'. It checks if the grid can be considered "valid" based on specific conditions related to the corners and edges of the grid. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the grid meets the criteria or 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operation. The key insight here is that the operation allows us to color a subrectangle with the color of any two selected squares of the same color. Therefore, the only way to make the entire grid the same color is if there exists a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner where all squares along the path have the same color. This is because we can use this path to propagate the color to the entire grid.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself.
3. It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`.
4. It checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`).
   - If they are different, it sets `impossible` to `True`.
   - It then checks if there is any horizontal or vertical line that has different adjacent colors.
     - If such a line is found, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
     - If no such line is found (i.e., `impossible` remains `True`), it sets `ans` to `'NO'`.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Flaw in the Logic:
The flaw in the logic is that it only checks for the presence of a horizontal or vertical line with different adjacent colors. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there is a path from the top-left to the bottom-right with the same color. There could be a path with the same color that is neither purely horizontal nor purely vertical.

### Correctness:
Given the flaw in the logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to consider paths that are not strictly horizontal or vertical.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
