The given code snippet appends the current value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. This means that the last element of `smin` will now be duplicated.

Given the initial state, `smin` initially contains only one element `[0]`. After executing the line `smin.append(smin[i])`, `smin` will contain two elements, both of which are `0`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, 0], `sm` is calculated based on the final suf[n], `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is int(b[1]), `l` is a list of integers from the input, and suf[i + 1] is greater than or equal to smin[i]**.
