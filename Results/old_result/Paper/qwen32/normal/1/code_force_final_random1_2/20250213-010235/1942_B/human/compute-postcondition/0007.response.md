Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n`. The current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**
