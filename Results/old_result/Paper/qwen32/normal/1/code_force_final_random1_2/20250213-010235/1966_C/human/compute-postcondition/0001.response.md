To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `tc > 0`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The only variable in the loop head is `tc`. For the loop to execute at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `tc` is a positive integer. Since `tc` represents the number of test cases, it should naturally be a positive integer. However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of modifying the state so that the loop can proceed, we can state that `tc` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is at least 1; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
