The code appends the value of `n` to the `final` list. Since `final` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing `[n]`; `c1` remains `o * 100 // n` and is less than 50; `_` is incremented by the length of `lst`; `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged.**
