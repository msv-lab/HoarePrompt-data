Output State: **`current_year` is `next_year`; `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `a[0]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `current_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
