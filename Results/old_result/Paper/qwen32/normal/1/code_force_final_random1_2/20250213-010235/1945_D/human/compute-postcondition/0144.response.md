Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` â‰¤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to reach a specified position `m` from position `n` by either passing through elements in list `b` or swapping to elements in list `a`.**
