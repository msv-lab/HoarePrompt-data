### Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the rules specified in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `n`, which is the number of signs.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, which represent the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the current year as we simulate the occurrence of each sign.
   - For each sign with periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates the `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
     - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, then `year % ai` is 0.
     - The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively computes the next occurrence of the sign. If `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, it adds the remainder to `year` to reach the next multiple of `ai`. If `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it simply adds `ai` to move to the next occurrence.
     - This ensures that the signs occur sequentially, with each sign occurring strictly after the previous one.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `year` value, which is the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input:** `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing:**
  - Start with `year = 0`.
  - First sign (`ai = 3`): `year = 0 + 3 = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign (`ai = 2`): `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign (`ai = 4`): `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign (`ai = 5`): `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign (`ai = 9`): `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign (`ai = 18`): `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- **Output:** `36`

This matches the expected result, confirming that the program works correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
