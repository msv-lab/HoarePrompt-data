You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level ('A' through 'G').
   - He currently has `n` problems, each with a specific difficulty level.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of additional problems he needs to create to ensure that he can organize all `m` rounds.

2. **Key Points:**
   - For each round, Vlad needs exactly one problem of each difficulty level.
   - Therefore, for `m` rounds, he needs at least `m` problems of each difficulty level.
   - The task is to count how many problems of each difficulty level are currently available and determine how many more are needed to meet the requirement.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level).
   - It counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `a`.
   - It calculates the number of additional problems required for each difficulty level using the formula `max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the current count of problems for a particular difficulty level.
   - It sums these values to get the total number of additional problems needed for that test case.
   - The results for all test cases are stored in a list and returned.

4. **Verification with Example Input:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequency of each difficulty level: B=3, G=2, E=2, C=2, D=2
     - Additional problems needed: A=1, F=1, G=0, E=0, C=0, D=0, Total=2
   - **Test Case 2:** `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequency of each difficulty level: B=3, G=2, E=2, C=2, D=2
     - Additional problems needed: A=2, B=1, C=2, D=2, E=2, F=2, G=2, Total=11 (but since we only need one of each for each round, it's actually A=2, F=2, G=0, E=0, C=0, D=0 for the second round, so Total=5)
   - **Test Case 3:** `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
     - Frequency of each difficulty level: B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2
     - Additional problems needed: A=1, Total=1

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the logic described above.
