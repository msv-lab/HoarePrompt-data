The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial conditions, `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[ind][0]` equals 'B' or not. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `tmp` determines which list within `goal` gets the new tuple appended, the exact list modified depends on the value of `tmp`. However, the structure and conditions of the other variables remain consistent.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` includes an additional element `(i, ind)`**.
