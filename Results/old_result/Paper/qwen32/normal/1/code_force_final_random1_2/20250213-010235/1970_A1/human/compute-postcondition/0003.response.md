To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. 

Given the provided state:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `balance_info` is an empty list.
- `balance` is 0.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is already defined as the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, `n` must be at least 2 (the smallest balanced sequence is "()").
   
2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, there's no need to adjust `i` manually before the loop starts.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `s`, `balance_info`, and `balance` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head requirements. However, they are part of the overall state and should be correctly initialized as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that could potentially affect the execution of the loop is `n`, but since `n` is correctly set as the length of the string `s`, and `s` is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already appropriate for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list; `balance` is 0; `i` is 0**
