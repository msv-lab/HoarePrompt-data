The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` with new integer values obtained from the input. This means the previous contents of `l` are replaced with the new input values. The values of `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `i` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in the original `l`.**
