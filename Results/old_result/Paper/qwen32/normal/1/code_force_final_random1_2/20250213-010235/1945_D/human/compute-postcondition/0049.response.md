The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial state specifies that `c` is `c + 1` and `cases` must be greater than `c + 1`. These conditions remain unchanged by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` must be greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input.**
