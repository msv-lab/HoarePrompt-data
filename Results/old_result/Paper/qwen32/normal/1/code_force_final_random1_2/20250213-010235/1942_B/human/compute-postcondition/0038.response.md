To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first). For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` if `mex - ar[i]` is smaller than the current `mex`.

### Initial Conditions
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not affected by the loop).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `res` is initialized as a list of `None` with length `n`.
- `mex` is initialized to `n`.

### Iteration Process
For each iteration `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`:
1. Compute `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
2. Update `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex - ar[i]` is less than the current `mex`.

### Final Output State
After all iterations, the loop will have processed every element in `ar` in reverse order. The `res` list will contain computed values based on the `mex` at each step, and `mex` will reflect the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used yet.

### Output State
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ar` remains unchanged.
- `res` will be a list of integers where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` during the corresponding iteration.
- `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations.

### Final Output State in Specified Format
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the corresponding iteration, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations.**

In simpler terms, the `res` list will have each element set to the difference between the current `mex` and the corresponding element in `ar`, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been encountered in the process.
