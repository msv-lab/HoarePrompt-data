The value of `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is `j + 1` from the initial state, which means it is incremented by 1 before being used in the calculation of `i`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`**.
