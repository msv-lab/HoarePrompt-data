Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` remains the same, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements in `b_values` found in the last `m` elements of `a`, `curr` reflects the final count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values`, and `b` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains the same, `i` is the first element of `b_values`, `cnt_b` has the element `i` set to 0, `curr` reflects the final count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values` must have at least one element, `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains the same, `i` is the next element of `b_values`, `cnt_b` has the element `i` set to 0, `curr` reflects the final count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values` must have at least one element, `b` remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains the same, `i` is the next element of `b_values`, `cnt_b` has the element `i` set to 0, `curr` reflects the final count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values` must have at least one element, `b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
