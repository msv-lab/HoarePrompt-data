The function `func_13` calculates and returns a tuple containing the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. Specifically, it returns `(x, y, g)` such that `ax + by = g`, where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0, a)`.
