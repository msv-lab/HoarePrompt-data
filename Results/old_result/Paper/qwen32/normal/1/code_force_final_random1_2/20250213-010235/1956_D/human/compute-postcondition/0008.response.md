The only objects in the loop head are the variables `l` and `r`, which represent the elements of the tuples in the list `ops`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration includes `ops` as a list containing at least two tuples, and the next tuple `(l, r)` is the one to be processed, we need to set `l` and `r` to the values of the next tuple in the list.

Since the loop processes each tuple in `ops` sequentially, the next tuple to be processed would be the one immediately following the current tuple. However, since we don't have the specific values of the current tuple or the exact position in the list, we can infer that `l` and `r` should be set to the values of the next tuple in the sequence.

Assuming the current tuple has already been processed, the next tuple `(l, r)` would be the subsequent tuple in the list `ops`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2`, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, and `(l, r)` is the next tuple to be processed from `ops`**
