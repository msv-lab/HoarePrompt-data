The code snippet assigns the length of the list `arr` minus 1 to the variable `n`. Given that `arr` has at least 3 elements (including the appended `0`), the length of `arr` is at least 3, making `n` at least 2.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` remains at least 1.
- `arr` remains a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements.
- `dp` remains `True`.
- `n` is now the length of `arr` minus 1, which is at least 2.
- `i` remains `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `True`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2), `i` is `n-1`.**
