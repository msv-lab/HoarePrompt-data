The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `a`. The values of `t`, `ntest`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` must be greater than 0; for each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.**
