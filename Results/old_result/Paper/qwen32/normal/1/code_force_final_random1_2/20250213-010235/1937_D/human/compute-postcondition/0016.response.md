To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 4

However, the code snippet involves variables `A` and `idx_A`, which are not mentioned in the initial state. Since these variables are not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute their exact values. For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that `A` and `idx_A` are lists, and we will express `x` in terms of the elements of these lists.

Let's denote:
- `A[len(A) - 1]` as the last element of list `A`
- `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` as the last element of list `idx_A`
- `len(A)` as the length of list `A`
- `len(idx_A)` as the length of list `idx_A`

Given that `i` is 4, the expression for `x` becomes:
```
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (4 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Since the exact values of `A`, `idx_A`, `len(A)`, and `len(idx_A)` are not specified, we can only express `x` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 4; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (4 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**
