The given code sorts the list `val` using a custom key function. The key function sorts primarily by whether the element is odd or even (even numbers come first), and secondarily by the value itself.

Given the initial state:
- `val` contains differences between consecutive elements of another list `l`, each decreased by 1.
- `sx` is the count of `1`s in `val`.
- `i` is `x`.

After executing the sort operation:
- The list `val` will be rearranged such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order.

Since `sx` is the count of `1`s in `val` and sorting does not change the count of any specific number, `sx` remains unchanged.
- `i` also remains unchanged as it is simply an index or counter and not affected by the sort operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`val` is sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `sx` is the count of `1`s in `val`; `i` is `x`.**
