The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `gap` or `ans`. Therefore, the value of `gap` remains as the next element in the list `odd`, and `ans` continues to be increased by `2 * y`, which is now `0`.

Output State: **`gap` is the next element in the list `odd`; `ans` is increased by `0`; `y` is `0`.**
