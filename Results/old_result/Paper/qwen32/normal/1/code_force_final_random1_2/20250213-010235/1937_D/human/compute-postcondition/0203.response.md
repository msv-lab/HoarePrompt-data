To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations. The loop iterates over a string `s` of length `n`, and the operations inside the loop depend on whether the current character `s[i]` is `'>'` or not.

Given the initial state:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `4`

Let's analyze the loop based on the provided outputs after the first three iterations.

### Iteration 1:
- `i = 0`
- If `s[0] == '>'`, `l` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[0] != '>'`, `r` is decremented by 1.

### Iteration 2:
- `i = 1`
- If `s[1] == '>'`, `l` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[1] != '>'`, `r` is decremented by 1.

### Iteration 3:
- `i = 2`
- If `s[2] == '>'`, `l` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[2] != '>'`, `r` is decremented by 1.

From the problem statement, we know the values of `l` and `r` change based on the characters in `s`. Since the problem does not specify the exact string `s`, we can infer the possible outcomes based on the operations described.

### Final State Analysis:
- If `s` contains more `'>'` characters, `l` will increment until it reaches `r`.
- If `s` contains more non-`'>'` characters, `r` will decrement until it reaches `l`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact string `s`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `s` contains a mix of `'>'` and non-`'>'` characters, leading to `l` and `r` eventually meeting or crossing each other.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the operations, the final state will be when `l` equals `r` or they cross each other. Assuming `s` is such that `l` and `r` meet at the midpoint, the final state would be:

- `l` could be `2` and `r` could be `2` if `s` has an equal number of `'>'` and non-`'>'` characters up to the midpoint.
- The arrays `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **A is [0, 2, 4, 7], idx_A is [3, 5, 6, 7], B is [0, 1, 3, 6], idx_B is [3, 2, 1, 0], l is 2, r is 2.**

This means that after all iterations, `l` and `r` have met at `2`, and the arrays `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.
