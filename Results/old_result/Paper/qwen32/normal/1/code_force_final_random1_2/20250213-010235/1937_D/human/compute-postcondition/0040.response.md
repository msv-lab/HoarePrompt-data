The code appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial state, `idx_B` could either be empty or not empty. Since the code modifies `idx_B` by appending `i`, the new state of `idx_B` will include `i` as its last element.

If `idx_B` was initially empty, it will now contain one element, which is `i`. If `idx_B` was not empty, it will now contain all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and `s[i]` is `<`. If `len(idx_B)` was 0, then `B` is [0] and `idx_B` is `[i]`. Otherwise, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty and includes `i` as its last element, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`**.
