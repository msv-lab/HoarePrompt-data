Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `start` is initialized to 0. The values of `arr` and `nums` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the given code snippet.
