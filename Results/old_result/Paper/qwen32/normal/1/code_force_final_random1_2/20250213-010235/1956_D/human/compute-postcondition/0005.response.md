To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `n` is the integer value provided by the input.
- `s` is the first return value of `func_2`.
- `m` is the second return value of `func_2`.
- `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple `(l, r)`.

The `print` statement specifically outputs `l + 1` and `r + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `l` and `r`. Instead, it mentions that `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple `(l, r)`. This implies that `l` and `r` are elements of one of the tuples in the `ops` list.

Given this information, we can infer that `l` and `r` are indices or positions within some context (likely related to the list `a` or another data structure). The `+ 1` operation suggests that the printed values are likely 1-based indices, rather than the 0-based indices typically used in Python.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their roles within the `ops` list.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of one of the tuples in the `ops` list, respectively.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the first and second elements of one of the tuples in the ops list)**
