Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1 and is present in both lists `a` and `b`; `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is greater than 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`.**
