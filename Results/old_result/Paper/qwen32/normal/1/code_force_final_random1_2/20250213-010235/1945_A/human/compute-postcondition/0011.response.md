Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (This variable is not used in the provided print statement).
- `a` is the first integer from the input line.
- `b` is the sum of the second and third integers from the input line.
- `c` is the third integer from the input line.
- `s` is the next line of input from the file opened with `open(0)` (This variable is also not used in the provided print statement).

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

#### Step-by-step Explanation:

1. **Tuple Creation**:
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)` creates a tuple with two elements:
     - The first element is `a - -b // 3`.
     - The second element is `-1`.

2. **Index Selection**:
   - The expression `[c < b % 3]` is used to select an index from the tuple.
   - `c < b % 3` evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`).
     - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it corresponds to index `1` in the tuple.
     - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, it corresponds to index `0` in the tuple.

3. **Final Value Determination**:
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the value printed is `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the value printed is `a - -b // 3`.

### Output Description:
- The output depends on the relationship between `c` and `b % 3`.
- If `c` is less than `b % 3`, the output is `-1`.
- Otherwise, the output is `a - -b // 3`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1 if c < b % 3 else a - -b // 3 (where a, b, and c are defined as per the initial state)**
