Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`). If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m`; `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` that were found in `b` and had non-negative counts in `cnt_b`, adjusted by decrementing if `a[i + m]` was in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, and incremented if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` (after adjustments) is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 3; otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.**
