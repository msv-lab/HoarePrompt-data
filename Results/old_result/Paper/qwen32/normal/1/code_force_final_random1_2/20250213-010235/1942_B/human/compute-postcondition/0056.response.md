Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
