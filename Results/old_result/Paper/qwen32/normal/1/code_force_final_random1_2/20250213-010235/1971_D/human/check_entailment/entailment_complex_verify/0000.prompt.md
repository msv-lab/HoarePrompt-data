You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` (adjusted by subtracting 1 if there is at least one '01' transition) has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and prints the number of transitions between different characters in the string, adjusted by subtracting 1 if there is at least one '01' transition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to cut a binary string into the minimum number of pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).
- Each piece must be a contiguous substring of the original string.
- All pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. The code reads `t` test cases.
2. For each test case, it initializes `count` to 1 (since at least one piece is always needed).
3. It iterates through the string `s` and increments `count` whenever it encounters a transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
4. It sets a `flag` to `True` if it finds a transition from '0' to '1'.
5. After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
6. Finally, it prints the `count`.

### Testing the Code:
Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases to see if the code works correctly.

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - Transitions: None
   - Count: 1
   - Flag: False
   - Final Count: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `10101010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`, `0->1`
   - Count: 5
   - Flag: True (since there is a `0->1` transition)
   - Final Count: 4
   - Output: `4` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `111000`
   - Transitions: `1->0`
   - Count: 2
   - Flag: True (since there is a `1->0` transition)
   - Final Count: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and testing it with various inputs, including the provided examples and additional edge cases, it appears that the code correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**

The code handles all transitions correctly and adjusts the count based on the presence of a '0->1' transition, ensuring that the minimum number of pieces is calculated accurately.
