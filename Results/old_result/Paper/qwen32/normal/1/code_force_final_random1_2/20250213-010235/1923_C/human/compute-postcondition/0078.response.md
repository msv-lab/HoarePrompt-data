The given code snippet updates the value of `i` to be the difference between the cumulative counts of 1s up to index `b` and up to index `a-1`. This means `i` now holds the count of 1s in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `i`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the current iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.**
