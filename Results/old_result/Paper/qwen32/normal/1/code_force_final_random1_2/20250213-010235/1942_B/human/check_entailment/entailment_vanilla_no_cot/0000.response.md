To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly constructs a valid permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) as described in the problem statement.

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length \( n \).
   - `mex` is initialized to \( n \).

2. **Loop through array \( a \) in reverse order**:
   - For each element \( a_i \) in \( a \) starting from the last element to the first:
     - It calculates \( p_i \) as \( \text{mex} - a_i \).
     - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and \( \text{mex} - a_i \).

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints the constructed permutation `res`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not correctly maintain the MEX value. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of the permutation `res`. However, the code simply decreases `mex` without checking if the newly calculated \( p_i \) conflicts with previously assigned values in `res`.
- The logic of updating `mex` is flawed. The code only updates `mex` when `mex > mex - ar[i]`, which doesn't ensure that `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not in `res`.

### Correct Approach:
- We need to maintain a set of used numbers to correctly compute the MEX.
- As we construct the permutation, we should always use the smallest non-negative integer not already in the permutation.
- We can use a set to keep track of used numbers and find the MEX efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX and construct the permutation. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
