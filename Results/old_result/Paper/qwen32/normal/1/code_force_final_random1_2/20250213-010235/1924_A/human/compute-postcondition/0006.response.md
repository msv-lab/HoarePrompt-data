The code snippet initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string.**
