The given code snippet reads a line of input, converts each character to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged unless `i` is equal to the length of `a`, which is not specified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from the input string; `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not; if `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new[j]` is set to `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is set to `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`; otherwise, `new` and `new2` remain unchanged.**
