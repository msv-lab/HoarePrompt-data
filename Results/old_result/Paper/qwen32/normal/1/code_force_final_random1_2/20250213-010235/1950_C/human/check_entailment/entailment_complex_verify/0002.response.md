### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **24-hour format**: The time is represented as `hh:mm` where `hh` ranges from `00` to `23` and `mm` ranges from `00` to `59`.
2. **12-hour format**: The time is divided into two halves: `AM` (12-hour cycle starting from 12 AM) and `PM` (12-hour cycle starting from 12 PM). Hours are represented from `12`, `01`, `02`, ..., `11` in both halves.
3. **Conversion Rules**:
   - `00:00` to `11:59` should be `AM` with hours `12` to `11` respectively.
   - `12:00` to `23:59` should be `PM` with hours `12` to `11` respectively.
4. **Output Format**: The output should be in the form `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` with leading zeros preserved for hours less than 10.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes**:
   - The hour part `h` is extracted using `s[:2]`.
   - The minutes part remains `s[2:]`.

3. **Converting Hours**:
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it outputs `'12'` (correct for midnight).
   - If `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it outputs `h` as is (incorrect for `13` to `23`).
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it converts it to `int(h) - 12` and formats it with a leading zero (incorrect for `13` to `19`).

4. **Determining AM or PM**:
   - It uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` to determine whether to append 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - It checks if the hour `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'` to decide between 'AM' and 'PM'.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - It prints the converted hour followed by the minutes and the appropriate suffix ('AM' or 'PM').

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Hour Conversion for PM Times**:
  - For hours `13` to `19`, the program incorrectly prepends a '0' to the result. For example, `13` becomes `01`, `14` becomes `02`, etc. This is incorrect because hours `1` to `9` should not have leading zeros in the 12-hour format.
  
- **Handling of Midnight and Noon**:
  - The program correctly handles midnight (`'00'` -> `'12 AM'`) and noon (`'12'` -> `'12 PM'`).

- **Output Formatting**:
  - The program correctly formats the minutes and appends the appropriate suffix ('AM' or 'PM').

#### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue with hour conversion, we need to adjust the code to ensure that hours `13` to `19` are formatted correctly without leading zeros:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[2:]
        
        # Convert hour to 12-hour format
        if h == 0:
            h_12 = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h_12 = h - 12
        else:
            h_12 = h
        
        # Format hour without leading zero if necessary
        h_str = str(h_12)
        
        # Determine AM or PM
        period = "PM" if h >= 12 else "AM"
        
        # Print the result
        print(f"{h_str}{m} {period}")

# Call the function
func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper handling of hour conversion for PM times. Specifically, it incorrectly adds a leading zero to hours `13` to `19`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
