The code snippet `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given that `x` was initially the last element of `l`, after executing `l.pop(-1)`, `x` is no longer part of the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is now `k - i + 1`. If `1 + i > k`, the program would return the value of `l`, but no return occurs here. The last element of `l` is removed, so `x` is no longer in `l`.**
