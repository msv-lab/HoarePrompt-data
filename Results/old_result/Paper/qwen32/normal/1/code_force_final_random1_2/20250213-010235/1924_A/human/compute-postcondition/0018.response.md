The given code snippet reassigns the value of `cur_ss` to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. This means `cur_ss` now holds the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet (assuming `ss` is a lowercase letter).

Since the value of `ss` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `cur_ss`, but we know it will be an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is an empty string.**
