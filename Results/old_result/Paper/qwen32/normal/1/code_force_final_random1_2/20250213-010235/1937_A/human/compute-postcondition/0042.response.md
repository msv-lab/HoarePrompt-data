The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` changes based on the user's input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `power` is set according to whether it was equal to `n` or not.**
