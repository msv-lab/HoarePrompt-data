In this case, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable here is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The number of iterations is determined by the value of `int(input())`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input
- `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1) from `l`
- `i` is 2*(n-1)

None of these variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `score`, `i`) are directly involved in controlling the loop's execution. The loop's execution is solely dependent on the value provided by `int(input())`.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect or get affected by the other variables, and there are no adjustments needed for `_` itself (as it's just a placeholder), the state of the other variables remains unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop control mechanism (`int(input())`) would have decremented its internal counter by one (if we were to simulate the loop's behavior).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1) from `l`, `i` is 2*(n-1)**
