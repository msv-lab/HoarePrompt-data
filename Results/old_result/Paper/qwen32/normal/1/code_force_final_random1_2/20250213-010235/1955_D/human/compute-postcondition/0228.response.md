The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m`, and `n` must be greater than `m`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m + 1`.

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - m`. Given that `i` is now `m + 1`, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n - m > m + 1`, which simplifies to `n > m + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `cnt_b` remains unchanged, `curr` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0**
