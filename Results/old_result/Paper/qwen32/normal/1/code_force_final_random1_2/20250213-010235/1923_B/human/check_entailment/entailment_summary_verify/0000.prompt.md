You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers representing the health of each monster, a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters under the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can kill all `n` monsters before any of them reach the player at position `0`.
- Every second, we can shoot up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1.
- After shooting, any monster with health `<= 0` dies.
- All remaining monsters move one step closer to the player.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, x, k)`: This function determines whether it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the player.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by reading input and calling `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1(a, x, k)`:
- It sorts the indices of monsters based on their absolute positions (`abs(x[i])`).
- It iterates through the sorted list of monsters, ensuring that no monster reaches the player (`x == 0`).
- For each distance, it attempts to shoot at the monsters until either:
  - All bullets (`k`) are used up.
  - All monsters at the current distance are killed.
- It increments the distance and repeats the process until all monsters are either killed or reach the player.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, the list of health values `a`, and the list of positions `x`.
- Calls `func_1` to determine if it's possible to kill all monsters and prints "YES" or "NO".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that monsters are sorted by their absolute positions. This is correct since we want to prioritize killing monsters that are closest to the player.
   - The program correctly checks if a monster reaches the player (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`).
   - The program correctly uses the available bullets (`k`) to reduce the health of monsters.

2. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program seems to handle the core logic correctly. However, we need to ensure that it works for all edge cases, such as:
     - When `k` is very large (e.g., `k >= sum(a)`), it should always be possible to kill all monsters.
     - When `k` is very small (e.g., `k = 1`), it should only be possible to kill all monsters if the total health of monsters is less than or equal to the number of turns available before they reach the player.
     - When all monsters are at the same position, the program should correctly handle the distribution of bullets.

### Testing with Edge Cases:
Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **All Monsters at Same Position**:
   - Input: `n=3, k=2`, `a=[1, 2, 3]`, `x=[1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (since we can kill all monsters before they reach the player).

2. **Monsters Spread Out**:
   - Input: `n=3, k=1`, `a=[1, 1, 1]`, `x=[-1, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (since we can only kill one monster per turn and the farthest monster will reach the player).

3. **Monsters with High Health**:
   - Input: `n=2, k=10`, `a=[10, 10]`, `x=[-1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (since we can kill both monsters before they reach the player).

4. **Monsters with Low Health**:
   - Input: `n=2, k=1`, `a=[1, 1]`, `x=[-1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (since we can kill both monsters in two turns).

5. **Monsters Moving Quickly**:
   - Input: `n=2, k=1`, `a=[1, 1]`, `x=[-2, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (since the monsters will reach the player before we can kill them).

After testing these edge cases, the program appears to handle them correctly. Therefore, based on the analysis and testing, the program seems to meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if all monsters can be killed before they reach the player. It handles sorting by absolute position, distributing bullets effectively, and checking if any monster reaches the player. The program also seems to handle various edge cases correctly.
