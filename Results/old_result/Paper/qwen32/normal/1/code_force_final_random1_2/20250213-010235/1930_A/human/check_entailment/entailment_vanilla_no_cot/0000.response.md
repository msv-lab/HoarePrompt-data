To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score based on the problem description.

### Strategy Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the score by choosing pairs of numbers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. To achieve the highest possible score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that the minimum value added to the score in each step is as large as possible.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which indicates that there are `2n` numbers.
   - It then reads the list of `2n` numbers and sorts them in ascending order.

2. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The code initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the element at each even index to the score.
     - This means it adds the smallest number in each pair of the sorted list to the score.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, it prints the final score.

### Verification:
- By sorting the list and summing every other element starting from the smallest, the code effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, maximizing the score as per the optimal strategy discussed above.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
