Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`:** The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. However, the problem requires rounding up when `n` is odd. This can be achieved using `math.ceil(n / 2)` or `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Percentage Calculation:** The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages (`* 100 // ...`). However, the problem requires checking if the counts meet the criteria directly, not as percentages. Specifically, you need to check if `zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and `one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The code does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road could be placed before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`). These cases need to be explicitly checked.

4. **Final Decision Logic:** The logic for determining the final answer is flawed. The code attempts to find the closest index to `pk` but does not correctly handle the scenario where no valid `i` is found in the loop.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        pk = (n + 1) // 2  # Correct calculation of pk
        zero, one = 0, 0
        best_i = None
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            # Check the left side condition
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2):
                # Check the right side condition
                if one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                    diff = abs(pk - (i + 1))
                    if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i + 1 < best_i):
                        min_diff = diff
                        best_i = i + 1
        
        # Check placing the road before the first house
        if one >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            diff = abs(pk - 0)
            if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and 0 < best_i):
                best_i = 0
        
        # Check placing the road after the last house
        if zero >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            diff = abs(pk - n)
            if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and n < best_i):
                best_i = n
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should correctly solve the problem.
