Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `tmp` or `goal`.**
