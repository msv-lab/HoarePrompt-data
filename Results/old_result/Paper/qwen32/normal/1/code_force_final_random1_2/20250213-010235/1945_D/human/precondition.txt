t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three elements: an integer n such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and two lists a and b, each of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
