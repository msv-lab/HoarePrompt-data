The code appends a new input string to the list `gr`. Since `gr` initially contains one element (the input string), after appending another input string, `gr` will contain two elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing two elements (both input strings), `ans` is undefined, `i` is 1**.
