Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `cnt_b` has the count of `a[m + 1]` incremented by 1, `ans` remains 0. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.**
