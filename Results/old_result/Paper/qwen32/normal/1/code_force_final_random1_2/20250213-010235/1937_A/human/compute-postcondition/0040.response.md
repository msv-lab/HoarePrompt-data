Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user. If `n` is equal to 1, `n` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is updated to the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n - 1`.**
