t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple where the first element is a tuple (n, x, y) with 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The second element of each test case is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
