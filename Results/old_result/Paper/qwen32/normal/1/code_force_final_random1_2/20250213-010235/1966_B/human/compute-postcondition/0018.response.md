The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `m-2` (since `range(m - 1)` generates numbers from 0 to `m-2`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value between 0 and `m-2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, as long as it remains within the valid range.

Given the loop condition, if `j` is currently `k`, then for the next iteration, `j` should be `k+1`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k+1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the given state, we can generalize that `j` should simply be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; additionally, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If at least one of the following conditions holds—either the character at position `j` in the first row (`gr[0][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the first row (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the character at position `j` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`)—then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `j` is incremented by 1.**

To be specific, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` is `k+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; additionally, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If at least one of the following conditions holds—either the character at position `j` in the first row (`gr[0][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the first row (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the character at position `j` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`)—then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `j` is `k+1`.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can represent the state as:

If at least one of the following conditions holds—either the character at position `j` in the first row (`gr[0][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the first row (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the character at position `j` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the last row (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`)—then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `j` is incremented by 1.**
