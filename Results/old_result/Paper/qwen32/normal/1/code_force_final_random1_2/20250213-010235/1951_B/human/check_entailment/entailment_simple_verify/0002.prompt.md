You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Setup**: There are `n` cows with distinct ratings, and they compete in a series of `n-1` matches.
2. **Match Rules**: 
   - The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2.
   - Each subsequent match involves the winner of the previous match against the next cow in line.
   - The cow with the higher rating wins.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of wins for cow `k` by optionally swapping its position once before the tournament starts.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this problem by considering two scenarios:
1. **No Swap**: It simulates the tournament without any swaps and counts the number of wins for cow `k`.
2. **Swap**: It considers swapping cow `k` with another cow and then simulates the tournament to count the number of wins for cow `k`.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of cows `n`, the index of the cow `k`, and the list of ratings `s`.
2. **No Swap Simulation**:
   - It swaps cow `k` with the cow in position 1.
   - It then simulates the tournament from the start and counts how many matches cow `k` wins.
   - After simulation, it restores the original positions.
3. **Swap Simulation**:
   - It identifies the point where cow `k` would lose in the no-swap scenario (`p`).
   - It swaps cow `k` with the cow at position `p`.
   - It simulates the tournament again and counts the number of wins for cow `k`.
   - It prints the maximum number of wins obtained from the two scenarios.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Swap Logic**:
   - The logic for identifying the best position to swap cow `k` is flawed. The program simply swaps cow `k` with the cow at the point `p` where cow `k` would lose in the no-swap scenario. However, this doesn't necessarily maximize the number of wins for cow `k`. The optimal swap position should be determined by considering all possible swaps and their outcomes.
   
2. **Restoration of Positions**:
   - The restoration of positions after the no-swap simulation is done correctly, but the swap simulation doesn't restore the positions properly, which could lead to incorrect results in subsequent test cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program doesn't handle edge cases such as when cow `k` is already in the best possible position or when there are only two cows.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the swap logic and the lack of proper handling of all possible scenarios, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
