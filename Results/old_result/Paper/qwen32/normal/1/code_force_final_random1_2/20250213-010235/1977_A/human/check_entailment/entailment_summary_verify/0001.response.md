### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summary based on the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add or remove one cube.
- The key observation is that the difference `n - m` must be non-negative and even for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change, and we can adjust the number of cubes by an even number.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the conditions in the provided program:

1. `if n == m:`
   - This correctly handles the case where the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes. Since `n - m = 0`, which is even, this is correct.

2. `elif m > n:`
   - This correctly handles the case where the number of cubes desired is more than the number of moves available. Since `n - m < 0`, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes, so this is correct.

3. `elif m == n - 1:`
   - This condition is unnecessary and incorrect. If `m == n - 1`, it means `n - m = 1`, which is odd. Thus, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes, and this condition should not lead to a 'Yes'. This condition can be removed or combined into the next ones.

4. `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`
   - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to reach `m` cubes from `n` moves. The correct condition should be checking if `n - m` is even.

5. `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`
   - Similarly, this condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Again, this alone is not sufficient. The correct condition should be checking if `n - m` is even.

6. `else:`
   - This handles all other cases, but due to the incorrect handling of even/odd differences, it might incorrectly return 'No' in some cases.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be to check if `n - m` is non-negative and even, or if `n - m` is zero.

### Revised Conditions:
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases due to the unnecessary and incorrect conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
