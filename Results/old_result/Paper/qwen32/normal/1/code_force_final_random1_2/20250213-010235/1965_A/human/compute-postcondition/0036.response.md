The initial state provides us with several pieces of information:

- There is no additional output before this print statement.
- The variable `test` is `True`.
- `lis` is a list with an odd number of elements.

However, none of these details affect the execution of the `print('Alice')` statement. This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
