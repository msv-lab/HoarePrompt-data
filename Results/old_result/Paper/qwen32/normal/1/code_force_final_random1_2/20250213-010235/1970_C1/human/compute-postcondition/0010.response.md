The code snippet `rev[b].append(a)` modifies the `rev` dictionary by appending the integer `a` to the list associated with the key `b`. This means that the list stored in `rev[b]` will now include `a` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged except for `rev`. Specifically, `rev[b]` now includes `a` in addition to whatever elements it previously contained.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `rev[b]` now includes `a` and any previous elements it had, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
