Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors with a length of at least 3, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and the newly appended tuple `(len(path_ba) // 2, i + 2)`, `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The `ops` list now includes an additional tuple `(len(path_ba) // 2, i + 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
