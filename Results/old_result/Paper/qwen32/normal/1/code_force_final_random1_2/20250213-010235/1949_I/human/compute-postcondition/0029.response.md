Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the new state of the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
```

Given Initial State:
- `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000)
- `x` is a list of integers with length `n`
- `y` is a list of integers with length `n`
- `r` is a list of integers with length `n`
- `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` which are `True`
- `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is `1`, `coef[1]` which is `-1`
- `tot` is 0
- `bipartite` is `True`
- `ok` is `False`
- `i` is 1

We need to evaluate the expression `ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0`.

First, let's break down the expression:
- `bipartite` is `True`
- `tot` is `0`, so `tot != 0` evaluates to `False`
- `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `True and False`, which is `False`
- `ok` is `False`, so `ok or False` evaluates to `False`

Therefore, the value of `ok` remains `False`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` which are `True`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is `1`, `coef[1]` which is `-1`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`; `i` is 1**.
