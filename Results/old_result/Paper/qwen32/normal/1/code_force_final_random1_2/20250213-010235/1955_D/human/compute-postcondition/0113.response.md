Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`, except the count of `a[1]` is decreased by 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is 1; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` (after decrement) is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is set to 2. Otherwise, `curr` remains 1.**
