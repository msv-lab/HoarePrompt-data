Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, `t` has been incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input where `k` must be at least 3, `a` and `b` retain their input values, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 3. If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**
