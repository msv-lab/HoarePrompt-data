Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be related to modular arithmetic (specifically, computing modular inverses), but they do not address the core task of counting permutations based on given prefix and suffix maximums.

The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific indices as prefix and suffix maximums. This involves combinatorial mathematics and careful consideration of how the maximums affect the possible placements of numbers in the permutation.

The provided code does not handle the permutation logic at all. It only includes functions for modular arithmetic, which are not directly relevant to solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the given problem for any test case.
