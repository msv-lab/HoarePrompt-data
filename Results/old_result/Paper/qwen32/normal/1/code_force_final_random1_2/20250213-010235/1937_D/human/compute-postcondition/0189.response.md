To determine the new value of `b` after executing the given line of code, we need to use the initial state provided:

- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 2
- `r` is decreased by 1 (so `r` is now 1 less than its previous value)
- `a` is `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
- `b` is `2` if `r - l >= 0`. Otherwise, `b` retains its original value as `B[r - 1]`.

Given the line of code:
```python
b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
```

We need to know the current values of `r` and `l` to compute the new value of `b`. However, these values are not explicitly provided in the initial state. For the sake of this example, let's assume some reasonable values for `r` and `l` that fit the conditions described.

Let's assume `r` was originally 2 (since `r` is decreased by 1, it would now be 1). Let's also assume `l` is 1 for simplicity.

With these assumptions:
- `b` is initially `2` because `r - l` (2 - 1) is non-negative.
- `idx_B[r]` is `idx_B[1]` which is `2`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `l` is `1`.

Now, substituting these values into the equation:
```python
b = 2 + (2 - 2) * 1
b = 2 + 0 * 1
b = 2
```

Since `b` does not change with these assumptions, the output state remains the same for `b`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2, `r` is 1, `a` is `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `2`**.
