To determine what will be printed by the `print(ind)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `ind` contains up to two indices of cows with ratings greater than `x`.
- `c` is the count of these cows (0, 1, or 2).
- `i` is the last index checked (potentially `n-1`).
- `k` is equal to 14.

From this, we know that `ind` could be an empty list, a list with one index, or a list with two indices, depending on how many cows have ratings greater than `x`.

However, the specific values within `ind` are not explicitly given, only the possible configurations of `ind` based on the count `c`. Therefore, we need to describe the output in terms of the possible states of `ind`.

Given that `ind` can be:
- An empty list `[]` if `c` is 0,
- A list with one index `[index]` if `c` is 1,
- A list with two indices `[index1, index2]` if `c` is 2,

We can describe the output as follows:

Output: **ind (where ind is a list containing up to two indices of cows with ratings greater than x, depending on the value of c)**
