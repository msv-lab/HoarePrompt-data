To determine the output of the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the construction of the list `a`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable indicates the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the construction of the list `a` for a single test case.
2. **`n`**: An input integer representing the number of elements in the list `x`.
3. **`x`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The length of this list is `n`.
4. **`a`**: A list constructed as follows:
   - `a[0]` is set to 1000.
   - For `i > 0`, `a[i]` is calculated as \(1000 + \text{sum}(x[0] \text{ to } x[i-1])\).

### Construction of List `a`:
- The first element of `a` is always 1000.
- Each subsequent element `a[i]` (for \(i > 0\)) is computed by adding 1000 to the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to the \(i-1\)-th index.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the construction:
- Suppose `n = 3` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`.
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + sum(x[0]) = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[1]) = 1000 + (10 + 20) = 1030`
- `a[3] = 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[2]) = 1000 + (10 + 20 + 30) = 1060`

Thus, the list `a` would be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

### General Case:
For a general list `x` with `n` elements, the list `a` will have `n+1` elements:
- The first element is always 1000.
- Each subsequent element `a[i]` for \(i > 0\) is calculated as \(1000 + \text{cumulative sum of elements in } x \text{ up to index } i-1\).

### Output Statement:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the construction process, the output will be a series of numbers starting with 1000, followed by numbers that are 1000 plus the cumulative sums of the elements in `x`.

Output: **1000, 1000 + sum(x[0]), 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[1]), ..., 1000 + sum(x[0] to x[n-1])**
