Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to half of `n` plus one, it prints `2 * k - 1`. Otherwise, it performs a series of calculations to determine and print a more complex value derived from `n` and `k`.**
