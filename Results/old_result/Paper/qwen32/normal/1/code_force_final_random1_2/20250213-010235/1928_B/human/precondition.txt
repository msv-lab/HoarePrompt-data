arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of the array a for a test case, followed by the elements of the array a itself. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t, and for each test case, the first element is the length of the array n, followed by n integers representing the elements of the array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
