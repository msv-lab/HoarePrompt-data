Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`); `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m-1`; `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` that were found in `b` and had non-negative counts in `cnt_b`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`). If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m-1`; `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` that were found in `b` and had non-negative counts in `cnt_b`. If `a[i + m]` was in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`). If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m`; `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` that were found in `b` and had non-negative counts in `cnt_b`, adjusted by decrementing if `a[i + m]` was in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, and incremented if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` (after adjustments) is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 3; otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`), with `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m + 1`; `curr` is adjusted based on the new value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 4; otherwise, `ans` is set to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
