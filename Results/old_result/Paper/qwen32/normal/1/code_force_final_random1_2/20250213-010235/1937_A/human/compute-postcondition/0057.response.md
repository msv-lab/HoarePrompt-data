Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0 (though it is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `i` is set to 2 (though it is also not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is calculated as \(\log_2(t)\).
- `power` is calculated as \(\log_2(t) - 1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
To determine the output, we need to understand the value of `power`:
- `power` is defined as \(\log_2(t) - 1\).
- Therefore, \(2^{power}\) is equivalent to \(2^{\log_2(t) - 1}\).

Using properties of logarithms and exponents:
- \(2^{\log_2(t)} = t\)
- Hence, \(2^{\log_2(t) - 1} = \frac{2^{\log_2(t)}}{2} = \frac{t}{2}\)

So, the expression `2 ** power` simplifies to \(\frac{t}{2}\).

### Output:
The print statement will output \(\frac{t}{2}\).

### Final Answer:
Output: **t/2 (where t is the given integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
