The code snippet `power -= 1` decrements the value of `power` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is log2(original value of n), `power` is not equal to `n` and `power` is decreased by 1.**
