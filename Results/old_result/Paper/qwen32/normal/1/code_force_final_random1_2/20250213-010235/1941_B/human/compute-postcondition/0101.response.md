Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i+1]` now equal to 0, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `opNum` is `a[i+1]` (which is 0), `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
