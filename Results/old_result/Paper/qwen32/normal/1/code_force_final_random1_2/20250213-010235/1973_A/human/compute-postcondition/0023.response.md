Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed), `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500, `cas_de_test` retains its list of tuples with the condition that each tuple has three integers in non-decreasing order, and there is at least one more tuple left to process. The next tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` is used to calculate `total_points` which is the sum of these three integers. If `total_points` is odd, `-1` is appended to `resultats`. Additionally, `total_matchs` is calculated as the integer division of `total_points` by 2.
