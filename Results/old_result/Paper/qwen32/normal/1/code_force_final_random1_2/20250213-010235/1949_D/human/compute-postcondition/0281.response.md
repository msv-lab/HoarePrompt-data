Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `n + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[k+1][n]`. Otherwise, `nx` has 'S' appended to its previous value if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise `nx` has 'F' appended to its previous value.**
