Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is ''; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was not set and is now set to 1. `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.**
