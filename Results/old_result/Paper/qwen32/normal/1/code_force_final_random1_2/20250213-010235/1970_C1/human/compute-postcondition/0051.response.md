Postcondition: **`queue` has one more element if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged. `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; otherwise, `visited` remains unchanged. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.**
