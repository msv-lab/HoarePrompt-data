The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Since `y` was initially 2, it now becomes 3. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, and if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is at least 2.**
