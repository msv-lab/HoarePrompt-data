Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; if `s[i]` is '>', `A` is a list containing either one element `0` or one element `[x]`, and `idx_A` is a list that includes the previous elements (if any) plus the new index `i`. If `s[i]` is not '>', `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.**
