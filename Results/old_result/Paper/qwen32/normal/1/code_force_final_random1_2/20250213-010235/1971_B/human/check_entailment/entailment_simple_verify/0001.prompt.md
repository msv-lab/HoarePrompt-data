You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code:

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is the last string processed, `a` is the set of unique characters from the last string `s`, `b` is the last string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the last string `s` sorted in descending order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If it's impossible to do so, we should output "NO". Otherwise, we should output "YES" followed by one possible rearrangement of the string.

### Program Analysis
Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the string `s` to find unique characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 2, it means the string consists of only two different characters. In this case, it prints "NO" because any rearrangement of such a string will still result in the same pattern (e.g., "aabb" can only be rearranged to "bbaa" or "abab", etc., but not to something completely different like "abba").

3. **Generating Rearrangements:**
   - If the string has more than two unique characters, it proceeds to generate two possible rearrangements:
     - `b`: The string sorted in ascending order.
     - `c`: The string sorted in descending order.
   - It checks if the original string `s` is equal to the sorted version `b`. If they are equal, it prints the reverse-sorted version `c`.
   - If `s` is not equal to `b`, it prints `b`.

### Correctness Evaluation
- **Case with Two Unique Characters:**
  - The program correctly identifies strings with only two unique characters and outputs "NO".
- **Case with More Than Two Unique Characters:**
  - The program generates two possible rearrangements (`b` and `c`) and ensures that at least one of them is different from the original string `s`.
  - Since there are more than two unique characters, there must exist at least one rearrangement that is different from the original string.

### Conclusion
The program handles both cases correctly:
- It correctly identifies when it's impossible to create a different rearrangement ("NO").
- It correctly generates a different rearrangement when possible ("YES" followed by the rearranged string).

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
