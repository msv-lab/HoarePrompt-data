The code snippet initializes a list named `res` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `ar`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `None`.**
