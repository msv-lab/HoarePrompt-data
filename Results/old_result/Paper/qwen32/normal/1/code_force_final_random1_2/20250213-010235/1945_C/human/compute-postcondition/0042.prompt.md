Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` (which is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` (which is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains empty; `mini` is 100000000; the current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise; `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', and 1 otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` (which is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` (which is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged; `mini` is 100000000; the current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise; `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise; `i` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` (which is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` (which is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged, and includes the value 5 if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is 100000000; the current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise; `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise; `i` is 4; `zero_perc` is either 0 or 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
