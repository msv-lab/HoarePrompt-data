Let's calculate the return value step by step:

- `start` is 20.
- `end` is 50.
- `num` is [100, 200], but this list is not used in the return statement.
- `count_num` is 0.

The return statement is:
```python
return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
```

First, let's calculate `end - start + 1`:
- `end - start + 1` = 50 - 20 + 1 = 31

Next, we check if `end - start + 1` (which is 31) is greater than or equal to `count_num` (which is 0):
- 31 >= 0 is True.

Since the condition is True, we perform the calculation `end - start + 1 - count_num`:
- 31 - 0 = 31

Therefore, the program returns 31.

Output State: **The program returns 31**.
