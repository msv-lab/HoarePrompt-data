The given code snippet decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. 

Given that `a[i]` is in `b_values`, it means `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Therefore, the value associated with the key `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will be reduced by 1.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b`, with `cnt_b[a[i]]` decreased by 1; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
