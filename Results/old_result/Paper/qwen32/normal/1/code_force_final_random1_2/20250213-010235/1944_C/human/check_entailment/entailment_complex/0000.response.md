### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires us to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Here's how the code attempts to solve the problem:

1. **Reading Input:** The code correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case (the size of the array `n` and the array itself).

2. **Counting Elements:** The code uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Finding MEX:** The core logic is in the `func_1` function:
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and an empty set `vis`.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value exists in the counter (`nums`).
   - If `start` exists, it adds `start` to the set `vis` and decrements its count in `nums`.
   - Then, it checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums`. If it does, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
   - If `start + 1` does not exist, it means `start` is the MEX of the array `c` (since all numbers from 0 to `start` are present, but `start + 1` is not), and it prints `start + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases:** The code handles the case where the array does not contain 0 by printing 0 immediately.

### Analysis of Execution States:

- **Test Case 1:** `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - `nums` will be `{0: 2, 1: 2}`.
  - The loop will run twice, decrementing counts of 0 and 1, and finally print `2` (since both 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not).

- **Test Case 2:** `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - `nums` will be `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`.
  - The loop will run four times, decrementing counts of 0, 1, 2, and 3, and finally print `4` (since 0, 1, 2, and 3 are present, but 4 is not).

- **Test Case 3:** `arr = [1, 1]`
  - `nums` will be `{1: 2}`.
  - The loop will not run because `start` (0) is not in `nums`, so it will print `0` immediately.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The code handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
