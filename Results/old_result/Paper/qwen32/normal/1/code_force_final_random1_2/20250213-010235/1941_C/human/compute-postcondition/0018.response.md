Output State: **t is an integer such that t = 0, a is the last integer value read from the user input, s is the last string value read from the user input, x is the number of times 'map' appears in the last s, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last s.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it counts down from its initial value to 0. The variables `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop, where `a` is the last integer input, `s` is the last string input, `x` is how many times 'map' appears in that last string, and `y` is how many times 'pie' appears in that last string.
