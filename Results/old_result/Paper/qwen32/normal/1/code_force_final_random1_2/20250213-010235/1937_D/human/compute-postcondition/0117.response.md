Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than `0`, and `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`. If `l <= r`, then if `l` is `0`, `r` remains `3`. If `l` is greater than `0`, `r` remains `3`, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `1 + 2i - il`. If `l > r`, then `l` is `0`, `r` is not greater than `l`, and `l` is not greater than `r`, or if `r` is not `0`, `r` remains `3` and `b` is `(i - 7) * 4`.**
