The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` (which were previously unspecified) are now set according to the input.

The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code snippet provided. The condition regarding `t`, `n`, and `k` (`4 * n - 2` equals `k`) is also not evaluated or changed by this code snippet, so it retains its previous meaning.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, then the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.**
