Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`. 
  - If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'.
  - Otherwise, if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, then `h` is less than or equal to 12.
  - Otherwise, `h` is greater than 12.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

#### Breakdown of the Print Statement:
1. **`s[2:]`**: This part of the code slices the string `s` starting from the third character to the end. For example, if `s` is "12:30", `s[2:]` will be "30".
   
2. **`['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`**: This part uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` and selects either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the condition `int(h) >= 12`.
   - If `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to `True`, it selects 'PM'.
   - If `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to `False`, it selects 'AM'.

### Output Explanation:
- The first part of the output is the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end.
- The second part of the output is either 'AM' or 'PM', determined by whether the integer value of the first two characters of `s` is 12 or more.

### Final Output:
Output: **s[2:] [either 'AM' or 'PM'] (where s[2:] is the substring of s from the third character to the end, and 'AM' or 'PM' is determined by whether the integer value of the first two characters of s is 12 or more)**

To make it more precise, let's consider an example:
- If `s` is "12:30", then `s[2:]` is "30" and since `int("12") >= 12` is `True`, the output will be "30 PM".
- If `s` is "09:45", then `s[2:]` is "45" and since `int("09") >= 12` is `False`, the output will be "45 AM".

Therefore, the final output format considering the general case is:

Output: **s[2:] [either 'AM' or 'PM'] (where s[2:] is the substring of s from the third character to the end, and 'AM' or 'PM' is determined by whether the integer value of the first two characters of s is 12 or more)**
