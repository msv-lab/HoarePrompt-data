To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and what it modifies.

The loop iterates over the range `m` and increments the count of each element in the list `b` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Specifically, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 during each iteration.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `cnt_b` is a dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of each element in `b`.

Here's the detailed breakdown:

- The loop runs `m` times.
- During each iteration `i` (from 0 to `m-1`), the value at index `i` in the list `b` is used as a key in the dictionary `cnt_b`, and its corresponding value is incremented by 1.

After all iterations (`m` iterations), the dictionary `cnt_b` will contain the frequency of each unique element in the list `b`.

Thus, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the integers read from the input.
- `a` remains the list of integers read from the input.
- `b` remains the list of integers read from the input.
- `cnt_b` will have been updated such that `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `m-1`.

In natural language, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b`.**
