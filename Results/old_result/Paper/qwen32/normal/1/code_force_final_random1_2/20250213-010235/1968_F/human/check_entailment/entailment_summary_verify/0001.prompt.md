You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a series of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines whether there exists a subarray within `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by a newline after each test case's results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
   - The solution involves precomputing prefix XOR values for the array and using these to efficiently answer multiple queries.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation:** 
     - `pf[i]` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
     - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray `[l, r]` as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

   - **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
     - `mp` is a dictionary where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where these XOR values occur.
     - This helps in quickly finding indices where a particular prefix XOR value appears.

   - **Query Handling:**
     - For each query `[l, r]`, we calculate the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]` as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
     - If `x` is `0`, the subarray can trivially be divided into any number of parts with XOR `0`.
     - Otherwise, we check if there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the prefix XOR at `i` is equal to `pf[r]`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the list of indices stored in `mp`.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach correctly computes the prefix XOR values and uses them to determine if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR.
   - The use of binary search ensures that the query handling is efficient.
   - The solution handles all edge cases, including when the XOR of the entire subarray is `0`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output for each query.

**Correctness: True**
