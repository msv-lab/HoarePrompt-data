The given code snippet only affects the variable `one` by toggling its boolean value using the `not` operator. The other variables (`tmp`, `lst[z]`, and `lst[tmp]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[z]`, `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation, `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list, and `one` is the opposite of its previous boolean value.**
