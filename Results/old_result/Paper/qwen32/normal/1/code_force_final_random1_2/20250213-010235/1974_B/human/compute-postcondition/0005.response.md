Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each occurrence of `char` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`; `char` is in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` now holds the value `len(unique_chars) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
