Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i + 1` (However, `i` is not initialized in the given context, so we can assume it was previously defined and incremented).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
