Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input. If `n` equals `m`, or `m` > `n`, or `m` equals `n - 1`, or `m` and `n` are both even, the behavior is as described in the if part. Otherwise, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` retain their values as described.**
