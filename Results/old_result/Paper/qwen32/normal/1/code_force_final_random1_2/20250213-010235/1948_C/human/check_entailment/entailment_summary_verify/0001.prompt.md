You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it checks if there exists any position where the character in one string is '<' and the character in the corresponding or adjacent position in the other string is also '<'. If such a position is found, it outputs 'No'; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- The robot starts at position (1, 1).
- The robot has two moves every second: 
  1. It can move in one of four directions (left, right, up, down), but cannot move outside the grid.
  2. After moving, it must follow the direction of the arrow in the new cell.
- We need to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

### Key Observations:
- Since the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n), it must eventually move down to row 2.
- The robot can only move down if it is in column `i` of row 1 and the arrow in cell (1, i) points to the right (`>`), and the arrow in cell (2, i) points to the right (`>`).
- Similarly, if the robot is in column `i` of row 2 and wants to move up, the arrow in cell (2, i) must point to the left (`<`), and the arrow in cell (1, i) must point to the left (`<`).
- If there is a column where the arrows in both rows point in opposite directions (one `<` and the other `>`), the robot cannot pass through this column without getting stuck or moving out of bounds.

### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates through every second column starting from column 1 (i.e., columns 1, 3, 5, ...).
- For each column `i`, it checks if:
  - The arrow in column `i` of row 1 (`a[i]`) and the arrow in column `i+1` of row 2 (`b[i+1]`) are both `<`.
  - Or if the arrow in column `i` of row 1 (`a[i]`) and the arrow in column `i-1` of row 2 (`b[i-1]`) are both `<`.
- If either condition is met, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
- If none of these conditions are met for all relevant columns, it prints "Yes".

### Issues with the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the movement logic.
- It only checks for specific patterns of arrows in certain columns but does not simulate the actual movement of the robot.
- The program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up and down between rows based on the arrows.
- The program incorrectly assumes that the presence of certain arrow patterns in specific columns means the robot cannot reach the target.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the provided rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
