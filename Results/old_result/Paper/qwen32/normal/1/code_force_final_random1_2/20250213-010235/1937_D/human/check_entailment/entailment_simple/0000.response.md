### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by precomputing the movements of pinballs starting from cells with '>' and '<' characters separately and then using these precomputed values to quickly determine the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on any cell.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation for '>' Characters:**
   - The code initializes two lists `A` and `idx_A`. `A` stores the cumulative movement times for pinballs starting from cells with '>' characters, and `idx_A` stores the indices of these cells.
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, if the character is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement time based on the previous cell's cumulative time and the distance between the current cell and the last cell with a '>' character, adjusted by the number of '>' characters encountered so far.
   
2. **Precomputation for '<' Characters:**
   - Similarly, the code initializes two lists `B` and `idx_B` for cells with '<' characters.
   - For each cell `i` in reverse order, if the character is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement time based on the previous cell's cumulative time and the distance between the current cell and the last cell with a '<' character, adjusted by the number of '<' characters encountered so far.

3. **Determining Movement Times for Each Query:**
   - The code uses two pointers `l` and `r` to track the current position in the `A` and `B` lists.
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, it determines whether the character is '>' or '<'.
   - Depending on the character, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total movement time for the pinball to leave the grid, taking into account the interactions between '>' and '<' characters.
   - The final result for each cell is printed.

### Analysis:

The approach seems to efficiently handle the problem by leveraging precomputation and dynamic programming principles. However, there are several points to consider:

- **Complexity:** The code processes each test case in linear time relative to the length of the grid, which is efficient given the constraints.
- **Logic:** The logic for calculating the cumulative movement times and the final movement times for each cell appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as grids with only '>' or only '<' characters, and grids where pinballs immediately leave the grid.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. The logic and complexity seem appropriate for the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
