Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur in any permutation of the scenarios. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Handling Undecided Videos**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to undecided videos based on whether the scenario is in the `sa` or `sb` list, which are lists of scenarios that have only funny or only scary videos respectively. However, it doesn't ensure that the assignments respect the constraint of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Assignment Logic**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to undecided videos based on the index in the `sa` or `sb` list being less than \(n // 4\). This logic is arbitrary and does not guarantee that the constraint will be met.

3. **No Backtracking or Checking**: The program does not backtrack or check if the assignment of 'F' or 'S' to undecided videos results in a valid sequence for all permutations of scenarios.

To fix these issues, a more sophisticated algorithm would be needed, possibly involving backtracking or dynamic programming, to ensure that the constraint is met for all possible permutations of scenarios. The current implementation does not provide such guarantees.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
