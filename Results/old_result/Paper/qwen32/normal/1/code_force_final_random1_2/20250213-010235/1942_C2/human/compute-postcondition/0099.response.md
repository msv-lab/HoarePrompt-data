Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `tmp`. Otherwise, these variables remain unchanged.**
