The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the integer value read from the input (which is `t`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `i` has just been incremented by 1, the new value of `i` should be the previous value of `i` plus 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `x + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`**

To make it clearer, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. So, generally:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1** 

This can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**
