Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is [], `t` is the first integer from the input. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is updated to the value of `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to the value of `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0.**
