To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet with the provided initial state. The key part of the code is:

```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `3`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`
- `r` is not equal to `0`
- If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `a` is `16`; otherwise, `a` remains `6`.

Since `l` is `0`, `l - 1` is `-1`, which means `idx_A[l - 1]` would be `idx_A[-1]` or `7`. 

The expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` becomes `(i - 7) * (3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `(i - 7) * 4`.

Thus, the new value of `b` is `b + (i - 7) * 4`.

Given that `b` was not defined in the initial state, we assume `b` starts at `0` for this calculation.

Therefore, the new value of `b` is `0 + (i - 7) * 4`, which is `(i - 7) * 4`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is `0`, `r` is `3`, `n` is greater than `0`, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `r` is not equal to `0`, `b` is `(i - 7) * 4`**.
