Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `b` is a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements where `b[0]` equals `a[0]` and `b[1]` equals `a[1]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]` and `new[1]` is `a[1]`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]` and `new2[1]` is `a[1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `new`, and `new2`) remain unchanged.
