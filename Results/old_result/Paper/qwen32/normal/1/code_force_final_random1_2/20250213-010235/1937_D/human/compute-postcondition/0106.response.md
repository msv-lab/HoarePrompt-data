Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `0`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`
- `l` is not greater than `r` since `r` is now `0`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved**:
   - `n`: Greater than 0, but its exact value is unknown.
   - `i`: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is defined elsewhere in the code and its value is not provided.
   - `l`: Value is `0`.
   - `idx_A`: List `[3, 5, 6, 7]`.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `idx_A[l - 1]`: Since `l` is `0`, `l - 1` is `-1`. In Python, negative indices access elements from the end of the list. Therefore, `idx_A[-1]` is `7`.
   - `i - idx_A[l - 1]`: This becomes `i - 7`.
   - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This becomes `(i - 7) * 2`.
   - `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This becomes `n - i + (i - 7) * 2`.

3. **Simplifying the Expression**:
   - `n - i + (i - 7) * 2` simplifies to `n - i + 2i - 14`, which further simplifies to `n + i - 14`.

### Conclusion:
The expression `n + i - 14` will be printed, where `n` is some positive integer greater than 0 and `i` is an integer whose value is not specified in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **n + i - 14 (where n is a positive integer greater than 0 and i is an integer)**
