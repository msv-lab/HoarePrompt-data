The provided code snippet writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. Since `func_15()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, based on the structure of the code and the requirement that `func_10()` must return a positive integer, we can infer that `func_15()` likely returns a positive integer as well.

Given that the only operation affecting the output is writing to the standard output, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer from `func_15()` has been returned and printed.**
