Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it resets the `cnt_b` array after processing each test case. The `cnt_b` array is used to keep track of the counts of elements in array `b`. However, after processing each test case, the program only resets the counts for elements that are in `b_values`, but it does not reset the counts for all possible values from 1 to `max_val`. This means that if a value that was not in `b` in one test case appears in `b` in a subsequent test case, its count might not be correctly initialized.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
2
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
4 5 6
```

For the first test case, the `cnt_b` array will be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]` after processing `b = [1, 2, 3]`.

For the second test case, the program will not reset the counts for values 1, 2, and 3, so the `cnt_b` array will still be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]` before processing `b = [4, 5, 6]`. This means that the counts for 4, 5, and 6 will not be correctly initialized, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program should reset the entire `cnt_b` array to zeros after processing each test case. Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reset the entire cnt_b array for the next test case
```

With this change, the program should correctly handle all test cases.
