To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `data` is a list of strings representing the input values where `data[idx - 3]` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1.
- `t` is `t + 1`.
- `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6`.
- `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
- `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and `mp[pf[i]]` now includes `i`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect this increment in the state description.

State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values where `data[idx - 3]` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and `mp[pf[i]]` now includes `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
