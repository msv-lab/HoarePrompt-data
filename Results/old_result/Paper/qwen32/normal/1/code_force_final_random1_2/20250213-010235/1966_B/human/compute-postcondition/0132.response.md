Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: Greater than 0.
   - `m`: Greater than 1.
   - `tc`: Always set to 2.
   - `gr`: A list containing `n` elements, where each element is a string.
   - `i`: Set to `n-1`.

2. **Conditions affecting `ans`:**
   - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` (i.e., the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`):
     - `ans` is set to 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`.
     - Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
   - If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]` (i.e., the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`):
     - `ans` remains 'YES'.

### Code Execution:

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Determining the Value of `ans`:

To determine the value of `ans`, we need to evaluate the conditions mentioned above:

1. **Check the condition `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`:**
   - This condition checks if the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`.
   
2. **Determine the value of `ans` based on the condition:**
   - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` is `True`:
     - `ans` will be 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`.
     - `ans` will be 'YES' if `impossible` is `False`.
   - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` is `False` (i.e., they are equal):
     - `ans` will be 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

Since the exact values of `gr`, `impossible`, and the specific characters being compared are not provided, we can only describe the value of `ans` based on the conditions given.

- If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and `impossible` is `True`, `ans` will be 'NO'.
- Otherwise, `ans` will be 'YES'.

Given this, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' unless gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1] and impossible is True, in which case ans is 'NO')**
