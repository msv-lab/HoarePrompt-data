The code snippet adds the value of `start` to the set `vis`. Given that `start` is initially 1, the set `vis` which previously contained only the value `0` will now contain both `0` and `1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is at least 1. `start` is 1 and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0. `vis` is a set containing the values `0` and `1`.**
