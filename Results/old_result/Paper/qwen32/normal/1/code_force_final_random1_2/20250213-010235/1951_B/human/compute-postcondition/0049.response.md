Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`; `s` must have at least one element; `i` is the next element in `s` after the previous `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `p`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
