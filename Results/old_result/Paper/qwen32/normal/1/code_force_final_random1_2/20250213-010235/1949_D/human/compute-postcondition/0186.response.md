The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 6, `j` is 6, and `n` is greater than or equal to 6. Therefore, `j - 1` is 5. The value of `nx` will be updated to its current value plus `xx[6][5]`.

Since the specific values of `nx` and `xx[6][5]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `nx` after the operation. However, we know that `nx` will be increased by the value of `xx[6][5]`.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, `nx` is increased by `xx[6][5]`.**
