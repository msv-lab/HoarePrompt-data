### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to determine whether the given grid contains a square or a triangle based on the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly differentiate between a square and a triangle.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Counting '1's in Rows**: The code counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in the list `k`. It then checks if the first two counts are equal to determine if the shape is a square. This is not a reliable method to distinguish between a square and a triangle.
   
   - **Square**: In a square, all rows containing '1's will have the same number of '1's.
   - **Triangle**: In a triangle, the number of '1's in each row will vary according to the pattern of the triangle (either increasing or decreasing by 2 each row).

2. **Pattern Matching**: The code does not actually check the pattern of '1's in the rows to confirm whether they form a triangle or a square. It only compares the counts of '1's in the first two rows, which is insufficient.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly identify the shape, the code should:
- Check the number of '1's in each row.
- Verify if the counts follow the pattern of a square (all counts are the same) or a triangle (counts increase or decrease by 2 each row).

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **First Test Case**:
   ```
   3
   000
   011
   011
   ```
   - Counts of '1's in rows: [0, 2, 2]
   - The code incorrectly identifies this as a square because `k[0] == k[1]` is false, but it doesn't correctly identify it as a triangle either.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   ```
   4
   0000
   0000
   0100
   1110
   ```
   - Counts of '1's in rows: [0, 0, 1, 3]
   - The code incorrectly identifies this as a triangle because `k[0] == k[1]` is false, but it doesn't correctly verify the triangle pattern.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to distinguish between a square and a triangle based on the given patterns. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
