The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a`. The function prints the first two return values of `func_2` (denoted as `s` and `m`) and subsequently prints pairs of indices (incremented by 1) from the third return value of `func_2` (denoted as `ops`).
