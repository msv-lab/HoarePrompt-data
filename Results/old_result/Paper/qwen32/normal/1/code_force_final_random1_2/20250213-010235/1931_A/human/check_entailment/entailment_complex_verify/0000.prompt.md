You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, printing `t` words based on the respective `n` values provided for each iteration. The variable `i` is `t`, and the `alphabet` string remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. It then generates and prints a specific string based on the value of `n` for each test case. The generated string is constructed using lowercase letters from the English alphabet according to predefined rules.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) back into the lexicographically smallest possible 3-letter word.
- Each letter in the word corresponds to a position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
- The integer `n` is the sum of these positions.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program attempts to decode the integer `n` into a 3-letter word using the following logic:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs the word by taking the letter corresponding to `n - 53` and appending "zz".
- If `n > 26`, it constructs the word by taking "a" and the letter corresponding to `n - 28` and appending "z".
- Otherwise, it constructs the word by taking "aa" and the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.

### Potential Issues:
Let's check if the logic covers all possible values of `n` correctly:

1. **Case: `n = 3`**
   - Expected word: "aaa"
   - Program output: "aa" + alphabet[0] = "aaa"
   - This works correctly.

2. **Case: `n = 26`**
   - Expected word: "azz"
   - Program output: "aa" + alphabet[23] = "aaz"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "azz".

3. **Case: `n = 27`**
   - Expected word: "baa"
   - Program output: "a" + alphabet[-1] + "z" = "azz"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "baa".

4. **Case: `n = 52`**
   - Expected word: "zzz"
   - Program output: "aa" + alphabet[49] = "aad"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "zzz".

5. **Case: `n = 53`**
   - Expected word: "zza"
   - Program output: alphabet[0] + "zz" = "azz"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "zza".

6. **Case: `n = 78`**
   - Expected word: "zzz"
   - Program output: alphabet[25] + "zz" = "zzz"
   - This works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when `n` is close to the boundaries (e.g., 26, 27, 52, 53). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for several values of `n` due to incorrect indexing and logic. Specifically, it mishandles cases where `n` is near the boundaries of the ranges defined in the conditional statements.
