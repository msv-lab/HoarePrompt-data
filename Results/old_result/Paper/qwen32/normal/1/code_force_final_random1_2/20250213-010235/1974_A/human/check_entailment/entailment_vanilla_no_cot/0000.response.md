Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. Let's analyze why:

1. The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which seems to be an attempt to determine how many screens are needed for the 2x2 icons, assuming that each screen can hold at most two 2x2 icons (which is correct). However, this calculation alone does not account for the remaining space on these screens that could be used for 1x1 icons.

2. The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This expression seems to be trying to determine the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons, but it is not used correctly in the subsequent logic.

3. The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect because `a` represents the total number of test cases, not the available space on the screens. This condition does not make sense in the context of the problem.

4. The final calculation `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is also incorrect because it does not properly account for the remaining space on the screens that have already been allocated for 2x2 icons.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- Determine the remaining space on these screens that can be used for 1x1 icons.
- Calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate remaining space for 1x1 icons on these screens
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4
        # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15 if x > remaining_space else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, determines the remaining space on these screens, and then calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
