Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed. `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is now 2. `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. `rest` is equal to `k` if no units were used up yet. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed; `x`, `k` must be greater than 0; `n`, and `sorted_indices` must have at least one element; `distance` is now 2; if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `rest` is equal to `k - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is reduced by `delta`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed; `x`, `k` must be greater than 0; `n`, and `sorted_indices` must have at least one element; `distance` is now 2; if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `rest` must be greater than 0; `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]; `rest` is now `rest - delta`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`; `x`, `k` must be greater than 0; `n`, and `sorted_indices` must have at least one element; `distance` is now 2; if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to `pos + 1`; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `rest` must be greater than 0; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` is decreased by `delta`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
