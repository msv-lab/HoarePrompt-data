The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the initial values of `a` and `b` are overwritten with the new input values. The variables `t`, `results`, and `winner` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.

In simpler terms, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers provided by the input, while the values of `t`, `results`, and `winner` remain as they were initially described.
