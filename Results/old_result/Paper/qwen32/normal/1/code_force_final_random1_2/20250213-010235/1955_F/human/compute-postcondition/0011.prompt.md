You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \leq p_i \leq 200 \)) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The total number of test cases \( t \) satisfies \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Each element in `p` is the nearest even integer less than or equal to its original value, and the printed output for each iteration is the sum of these even numbers divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. It processes these counts for each of the up to 10,000 test cases provided. The function returns a result based on these counts for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
