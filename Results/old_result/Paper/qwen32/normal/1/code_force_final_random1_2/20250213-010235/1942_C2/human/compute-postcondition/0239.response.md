Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i + 1 == x - 1` else `a[i + 2]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The values of `x` and `i` remain as per their initial conditions with `i` being incremented by 1. The value of `next_elem` is determined by the condition `i + 1 == x - 1`; if true, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`; otherwise, it is `a[i + 2]`.
