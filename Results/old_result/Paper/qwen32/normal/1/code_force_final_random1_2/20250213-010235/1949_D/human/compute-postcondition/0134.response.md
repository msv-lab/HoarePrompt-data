The given code snippet appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. This means the value of `nx` is updated to include the new character.

Let's break down the changes:
- `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. 

All other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified, which they are not in this snippet.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `n` must be at least 1. `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `nx` is a string that now includes the character `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it.**
