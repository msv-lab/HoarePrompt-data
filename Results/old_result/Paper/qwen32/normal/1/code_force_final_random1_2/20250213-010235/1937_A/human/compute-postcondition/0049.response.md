The code increments the variable `power` by 1. Given that the initial value of `power` is 2, after executing `power += 1`, the new value of `power` becomes 3.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(4 < t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is \(\log_2(t)\) where \(t > 4\), `power` is 3**.
