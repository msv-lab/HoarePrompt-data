To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `next_elem` is calculated as `a[0] + n` if `i + 1 == x - 1` else `a[i + 2]`.
- `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
- If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` contains the appended value of `gap`.
- If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the new element `gap`.

Since the loop head only includes `i` and `x`, we need to adjust these two variables for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1 from its current value.

The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `x` remains the same.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Note: The other variables (`next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted according to the given instructions.
