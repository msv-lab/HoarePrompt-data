The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the current iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. `a` and `b` are updated to the values obtained from the input.**
