Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `time` is defined as `current_time + 1`.
- `team` is explicitly set to `None`.
- `GoalName` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is implied to be a dictionary that maps team identifiers to their respective goal names.

Given that `team` is `None`, we need to consider what `GoalName[None]` would be. Since `None` is not a typical key for a team identifier, this implies that `GoalName[None]` might not be defined, or it could be a special case handled in the `GoalName` dictionary.

However, since the problem asks us to provide the most precise description based on the given information, we'll assume that `GoalName[None]` is a valid key in the `GoalName` dictionary and describe the output accordingly.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the current time incremented by 1, followed by the value associated with the `None` key in the `GoalName` dictionary, and then the string "GOAL".

Output: **[current_time + 1] [GoalName[None]] GOAL (where [current_time + 1] is the value of time and [GoalName[None]] is the value associated with the None key in the GoalName dictionary)**
