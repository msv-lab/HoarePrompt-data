The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of the variable `ans` by 1. The variables `i` and `a` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2. Since `ans` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it had some initial value before this operation, which we increment by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2; `ans` is increased by 1.**
