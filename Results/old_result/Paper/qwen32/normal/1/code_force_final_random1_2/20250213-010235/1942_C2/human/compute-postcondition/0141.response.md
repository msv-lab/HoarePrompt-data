The code snippet `c = i // 2` updates the value of `c` to be half of the current value of `i`, rounded down to the nearest integer. The other variables (`val`, `y`, `sx`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is `i_next`.
- `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`).
- `c` is now `i_next // 2`.
- `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c`.

After executing `c = i // 2`, the new value of `c` is `i_next // 2`. Since `i` is `i_next`, the value of `c` remains `i_next // 2` as stated in the initial conditions, which means there is no change in the value of `c` from what was already described.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_next`; `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`); `c` is `i_next // 2`; `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c`.**
