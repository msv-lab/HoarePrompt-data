To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

The loop increments the `power` variable until it reaches or exceeds the value of `n`, where `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `n`. The loop will stop when `power` is no longer less than `n`.

From the given output states after the first few iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `power` becomes 2, implying `n` must be greater than 2.
- After 2 iterations: `power` becomes 3, implying `n` must be greater than 3.
- After 3 iterations: `power` becomes 4, implying `n` must be greater than 4.

This pattern indicates that the loop will continue to increment `power` until `power` equals `n`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be equal to `n`.

Thus, the loop will terminate when `power` is equal to `n`, meaning `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(original value of n)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is log2(original value of n), `power` is equal to n.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep running until `power` matches the value of `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`. At this point, the loop stops, and `power` will be equal to `n`.
