The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 0, and `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
