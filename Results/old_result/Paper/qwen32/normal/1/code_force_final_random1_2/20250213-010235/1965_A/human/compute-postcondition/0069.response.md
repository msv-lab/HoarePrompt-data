Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `j` is `j + 1`, and `test` is False.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code snippet is the assignment of `False` to the variable `test`. All other variables retain their initial states and values.
