You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
For each of the `t` test cases, the function accepts two integers `x` and `n` and outputs the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`. If no such divisor exists, it outputs 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case according to the problem statement. The balance is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems, and we aim to maximize this value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` (the total difficulty) and `n` (the number of sub-problems).

2. **Finding the Maximum Balance**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - It iterates through potential divisors `i` from 1 up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x` can be divided into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` and the remainder can also be evenly divided by `i`.
     - If `x` can be divided into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `x // i` and the remainder can also be evenly divided by `x // i`.
   - If either condition holds true, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor `i` or `x // i`.

3. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the maximum balance for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic

- **Divisor Check**: The program correctly checks for divisors of `x` and considers both `i` and `x // i` as potential balances. This is because if `i` divides `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor of `x`.
- **Feasibility Check**: The condition `x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0` ensures that the remaining difficulty after allocating `n` sub-problems of difficulty `i` can still be evenly divided among the sub-problems. Similarly, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` ensures the same for `x // i`.
- **Maximization**: The program keeps track of the maximum feasible balance found during the iteration.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance for each test case. It efficiently checks all possible divisors up to the square root of `x` and ensures that the sub-problems can be formed with the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
