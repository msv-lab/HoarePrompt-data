Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` must be greater than 0; for each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is updated to the integer value read from the input, while the other variables (`t`, `ntest`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
