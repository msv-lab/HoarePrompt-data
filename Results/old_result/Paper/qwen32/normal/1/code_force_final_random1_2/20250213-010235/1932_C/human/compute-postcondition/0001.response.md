The code snippet provided initializes a variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, or `b`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `l` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is an empty list; `l` is 0.**
