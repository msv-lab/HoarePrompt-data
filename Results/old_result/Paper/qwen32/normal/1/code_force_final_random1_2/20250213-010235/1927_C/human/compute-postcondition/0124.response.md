Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers where either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. `t` has been incremented by 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input. `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained from the input. `newk` is `k // 2`. `i` is 1 and is present in both `a` and `b`. `k` is greater than or equal to 1.**
