The code snippet creates a new list called `new` with the same length as the list `a`. Each element in `new` is initially set to `None`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers, `b` is a list containing the individual digits of the input as integers, `new` is a list of length equal to `a` with all elements set to `None`.**
