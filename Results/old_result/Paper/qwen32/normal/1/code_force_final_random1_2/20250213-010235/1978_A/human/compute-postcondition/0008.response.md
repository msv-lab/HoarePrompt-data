Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input. This list contains `n` integers.
- `_` is incremented by 1. This line seems to be a placeholder or a counter, but it does not affect the print statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Explanation:
- `nums[:-1]` refers to all elements in the list `nums` except the last one.
- `max(nums[:-1])` computes the maximum value among the elements in `nums` excluding the last element.
- `nums[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `nums`.
- The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` calculates the sum of the maximum value of the first `n-1` elements and the last element of the list.

### Output:
The code will print the sum of the maximum value of the first `n-1` elements in the list `nums` and the last element of the list `nums`.

Output: **the sum of the maximum value of the first `n-1` elements in the list `nums` and the last element of the list `nums`**
