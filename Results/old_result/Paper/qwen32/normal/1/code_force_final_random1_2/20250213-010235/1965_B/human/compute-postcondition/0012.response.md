The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `l` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration). Therefore, `i` should be 4 for the next iteration.

Since `l` is already given as greater than 2 and there's no indication that it changes within the loop, we don't need to adjust `l`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and is greater than 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 2, 8], `i` is 4**
