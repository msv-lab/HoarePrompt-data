To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n + 1`.
- The loop condition is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `[1, n]`. Since at the end of the previous iteration `j` was `n + 1`, it means the loop has just finished iterating over all values from `1` to `n`.

Therefore, to start the next iteration (if there were another loop), `j` should be reset to the starting value of the range, which is `1`. However, since the loop has already completed its iterations, there is no next iteration to start. But if we hypothetically consider starting a new loop or resetting for another potential loop, `j` would be set to `1`.

Since `n` remains unchanged and does not need adjustment for the loop to start (it defines the range), we only need to adjust `j`.

State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1**.
