The code updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2` to be the sum of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` and the current value of `d1[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d1[i + 2]` which is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0**
