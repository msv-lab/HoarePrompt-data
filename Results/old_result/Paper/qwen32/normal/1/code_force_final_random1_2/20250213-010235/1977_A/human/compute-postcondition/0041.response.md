Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i + 1`. However, there is no initial value for `i` provided in the initial state, so this operation does not affect our understanding of the `print` statement directly.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. None of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m` are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
