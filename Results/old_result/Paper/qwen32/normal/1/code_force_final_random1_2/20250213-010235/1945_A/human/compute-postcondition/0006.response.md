The value of `b` is incremented by the value of `c`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer, `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, and `c` is an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer, `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, and `c` is an integer.**
