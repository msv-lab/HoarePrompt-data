Postcondition: **`t` is an integer that was initially read from input minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If at least one of `a` or `b` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2` if `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b`; otherwise, `b1` and `b2` are both set to `b // 2` if `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no changes are made to `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2`.**
