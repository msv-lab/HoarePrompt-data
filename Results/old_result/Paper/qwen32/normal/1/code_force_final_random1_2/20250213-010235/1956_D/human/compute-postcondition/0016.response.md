Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. `s` is the sum of elements `a[l]` to `a[r]` and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. Additionally, `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
