Given the initial state and the operation `b = b - A[l - r - 2]`, let's determine the new value of `b`.

From the initial state:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `3`

We need to compute the index `l - r - 2`:
\[ l - r - 2 = 0 - 3 - 2 = -5 \]

However, since `-5` is an invalid index for the list `A` (which has indices from `0` to `3`), it seems there might be a misunderstanding or an error in the problem setup because typically, such operations would be within bounds. But assuming the problem intends for us to proceed with the given values:

- `b` was initially `7`
- `A[-5]` does not exist, but if hypothetically we consider the modulo operation to wrap around (which is not explicitly stated), `A[-5 % 4]` would be `A[-1]` which is `7`.

So, the operation would be:
\[ b = 7 - 7 = 0 \]

Thus, the updated value of `b` is `0`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is `0`, `r` is `3`, `n` is greater than `0`, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `r` is not equal to `0`, `a` is `6`, `b` is `0`. Additionally, `l - r - 1 > 0` which means the current value of `l - r - 1` is greater than `0`.**
