The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial state mentions that `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the new input, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the code snippet provided does not involve `i` in any way, so the increment operation on `i` remains unaffected.

After executing the code snippet, `A`, `B`, and `C` will be assigned the values read from the input, replacing their previous values (which were described as positive integers but without specific values).

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are the positive integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
