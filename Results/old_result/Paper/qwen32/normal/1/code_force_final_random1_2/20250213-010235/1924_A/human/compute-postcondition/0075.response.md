The given code calculates the ASCII difference between the character `ss` and the character `'a'`, and assigns this value to the variable `cur_ss`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur_ss`, which now holds the integer value representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the string `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string. `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
