To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit upper bound derived from `x`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

2. **Upper Bound (`int(sqrt(x)) + 1`):**
   - This value does not change during the loop iterations.
   - It is determined by the value of `x` and remains constant throughout the loop.

### Adjustment:
- Since `i` is the only variable that changes within the loop, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is incremented by 1.** 

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is `i + 1`.**

To make it clear, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is 4.**

Generalizing this, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is incremented by 1.**
