Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `i` is `n - 1`. If `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is `'NO'` because at least one pair of adjacent characters in the first and last strings of `gr` differ at any position from `0` to `m - 2`. If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
