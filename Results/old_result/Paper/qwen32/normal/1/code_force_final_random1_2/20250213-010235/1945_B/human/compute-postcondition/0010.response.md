The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state, `t`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1. Otherwise, it is not the case that `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, or either `a` or `b` is equal to 1; `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms: The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the values read from the input. All other variables (`t`, `mn`, `i`) retain their initial values.
