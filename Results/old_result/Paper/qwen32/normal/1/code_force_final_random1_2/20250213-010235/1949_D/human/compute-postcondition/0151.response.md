The code appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `nx` will contain the single character `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the string containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
