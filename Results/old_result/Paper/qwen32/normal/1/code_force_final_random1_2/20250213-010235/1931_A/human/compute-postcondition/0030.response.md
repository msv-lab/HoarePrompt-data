Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is 4, and `word` is constructed as follows: if `n` > 52, `word` is the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'; if `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`; otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.**
