Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input; `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of the original `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now 1 for `b[i]` (previously 0); `i` is 0; `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was `>= k` during the loop; `curr` is the count of elements in the last `m` elements of the original `a` that are in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`; `n`, `m`, `k` are the input integers; `b_values` remains unchanged; `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1 for the specific index `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
