The given code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `lst`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, the starting nodes, or the integers `x` and `y`. It only introduces a new data structure `lst` which is a dictionary where each key's default value is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
