Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings representing the input values, t is t - 1, idx is 2*n + 3 + 2*q + 2, results is a list containing one element which is an empty string, n is the integer value of data[n + 3], q is the integer value of data[n + 4], a is a list of n + 1 elements where the element at index i (for i from 1 to n) is int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)]) and all other elements are 0, pf is a list of n + 1 elements where pf[i] is the cumulative XOR of the elements a[1] to a[i], and mp is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of pf[i] and the corresponding value is a list of indices i where pf[i] equals the key.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 2*q + 4`, `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being an empty string, the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `'NO'`, and the third being `'YES'` if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, the third element is `'NO'`. `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 2*(q-1) + 6`, `results` is a list containing five elements, the first being an empty string, the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `'NO'`, the third being `'YES'` if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, the third element is `'NO'`, the fourth element being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, and the fifth element being `'YES'` if the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `'NO'`. `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` is `q - 2`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 2*(q-1) + 8`, `results` is a list containing six elements, the first being an empty string, the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `'NO'`, the third being `'YES'` if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, the third element is `'NO'`, the fourth element being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, the fifth element being `'YES'` if the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `'NO'`, and if `x` equals 0, the sixth element is `'YES'`. Additionally, if the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is false, a sixth element `'NO'` is appended to `results`. `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` is 4, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
