Postcondition: **`ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` (if the first element is not `h`) and any subsequent elements that are less than or equal to `h` after encountering an element equal to `h`, `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` has been encountered, otherwise 0, `j` is 0, `ans` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1` and must have at least two elements, `h` is the first element of `s`, and `h` is greater than or equal to `i`**
