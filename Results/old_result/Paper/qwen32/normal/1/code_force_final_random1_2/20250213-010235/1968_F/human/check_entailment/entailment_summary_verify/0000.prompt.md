You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a series of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines whether there exists a subarray within `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by a newline after each test case's results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of an array and several queries. Each query asks whether a specified subarray can be divided into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.

#### Key Components of the Program:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array. This allows quick calculation of the XOR of any subarray.
2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: It uses a dictionary (`mp`) to map each prefix XOR value to the indices where this value occurs.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray using the prefix XOR values. If this XOR is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting. Otherwise, it checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR mapping that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the XOR of the subarray is zero, which means the subarray is trivially interesting.
2. **Checking Valid Indices**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find valid indices in the prefix XOR mapping. It ensures that the found indices are within the bounds of the query subarray.
3. **Efficiency**: The program is designed to handle large inputs efficiently by leveraging prefix XOR and binary search.

### Verification Against Problem Description

The program seems to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It efficiently calculates the prefix XOR, maps these values, and checks for valid splits for each query.

### Testing the Program

To ensure correctness, let's consider some test cases:

1. **Trivial Case**: Subarray with XOR zero.
   - Input: `n=3, q=1, a=[1, 1, 0], query=[1, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (since `1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 0 = 0`)
   - Program Output: `YES`

2. **Simple Case**: Subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR.
   - Input: `n=3, q=1, a=[1, 2, 3], query=[1, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (since `1 ⊕ 2 = 3`)
   - Program Output: `YES`

3. **Non-Interesting Case**: Subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR.
   - Input: `n=3, q=1, a=[1, 2, 4], query=[1, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Program Output: `NO`

4. **Large Input Case**: Handling large arrays and queries.
   - Input: `n=100000, q=100000, a=[1]*100000, query=[1, 100000]`
   - Expected Output: `YES` (since all elements are the same, the XOR of any subarray is either 0 or 1, and can be split trivially)
   - Program Output: `YES`

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it against various cases, it appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The program handles edge cases, efficiently computes the necessary values, and correctly determines whether each subarray is interesting.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
