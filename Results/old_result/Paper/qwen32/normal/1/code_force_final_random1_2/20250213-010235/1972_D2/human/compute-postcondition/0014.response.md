To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` must be at least 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is at least 2

Let's evaluate the current values of `x` and `y` in the context of the loop conditions:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(1 + 3) * 1 = 4 <= n`
   - Since `n` must be at least 3, this condition could still be satisfied if `n` is at least 4.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(1 + 3) * 3 = 12 <= m`
   - Since `m` must be at least 6, this condition could still be satisfied if `m` is at least 12.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` such that both conditions are met. Specifically:
- `n` should be at least 4 (to satisfy `(x + y) * x <= n`)
- `m` should be at least 12 (to satisfy `(x + y) * y <= m`)

No other variables (`x`, `y`, `cnt`) need to be adjusted because they are already given specific values and their relationship to the loop conditions is already considered.

Therefore, the modified state to ensure the loop can execute one more time is:
State: **`n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, and if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is at least 2**
