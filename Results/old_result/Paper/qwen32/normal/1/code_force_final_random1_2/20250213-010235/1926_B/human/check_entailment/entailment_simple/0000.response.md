### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to determine whether the shape formed by '1's in a binary grid is a square or a triangle based on the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly differentiate between the two shapes.

Here's why the logic is incorrect:

1. **Square Check**: The code checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows (`k[0] == k[1]`) are equal. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square requires that every row within the shape has the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be aligned in a way that they form a perfect square.

2. **Triangle Check**: If the counts are not equal, the code assumes it's a triangle. This assumption is also incorrect. A triangle (either upright or upside-down) has a specific pattern where the number of '1's increases or decreases by 2 in consecutive rows, centered around the middle row(s). Simply checking that the counts are not equal does not confirm the presence of a triangle.

### Example of Flaw:

Consider the following grid:
```
00111
00010
00000
00000
00000
```
This grid has a triangle, but the code would incorrectly identify it as a square because the first row with '1's has 3 '1's and the second row with '1's has 1 '1'. Since these counts are not equal, the code would print "TRIANGLE", which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed and can lead to incorrect results for other inputs.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the code does not correctly implement the logic to distinguish between a square and a triangle based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
