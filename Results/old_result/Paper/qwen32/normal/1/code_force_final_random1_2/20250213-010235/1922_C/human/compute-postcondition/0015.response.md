Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[3]` is 1. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.**
