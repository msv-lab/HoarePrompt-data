The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` based on the previous value `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element in the list `x`. Given that `a[i]` was initially defined as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, executing this line again will not change the value of `a[i]` since it is already calculated according to the same formula.

Therefore, the only change in the state would be the increment of `i` by 1, as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
