The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 2, as per the loop's step size. Therefore, `i` should now be 4. The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, `i` is 4**
