The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string (`''`), after this operation, `nx` becomes `'F'`.

All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` remains unchanged, `sb` includes all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0` or both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is `'F'`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. Additionally, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4]`.**
