To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and under what conditions it breaks.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2, meaning `i` takes on values 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n`. The loop checks two conditions:
1. If `i + 1 < n` and both `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are equal to `<`.
2. If `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are equal to `<`.

If either condition is met, the loop prints "No" and breaks. If none of these conditions are met throughout the entire loop, it prints "Yes" after the loop completes.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `n` must be greater than 1.
- After the second iteration (`i = 3`), `n` must be greater than 3.
- After the third iteration (`i = 5`), `n` must be greater than 5.

This pattern suggests that the loop will continue as long as `n` is large enough to accommodate the next odd value of `i`. The loop will terminate either by breaking when one of the conditions is met or by completing all iterations without breaking.

Given that the loop has executed 3 times without breaking, it means that for `i = 1`, `3`, and `5`, neither of the conditions was met. For the loop to complete all its iterations, `n` must be such that there are no more odd indices `i` for which the conditions are met.

The final output state depends on whether the loop completes all its iterations without breaking. If it does, the output will be "Yes". If it breaks at any point during further iterations, the output will be "No".

Since we don't have information about the strings `a` and `b` beyond the first 3 iterations, we assume that the conditions are not met for any further iterations. Therefore, the loop completes all its iterations without breaking.

Output State: **t is 1, n is an input integer, a is an input string, b is an input string. The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, so the output is "Yes".**
