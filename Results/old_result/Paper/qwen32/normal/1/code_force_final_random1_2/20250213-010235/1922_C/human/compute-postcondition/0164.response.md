To determine the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer where \(n \geq 2\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, updated based on the differences in the list `l`.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1, and other values calculated according to the loop logic.
   - `m`: An integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
   - `j`: Initialized to 2.
   - `x` and `y`: The last pair of integers read from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d1`:**
   - `d1` is a `defaultdict` where the keys are differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`, and the values are counts of how many times these differences occur.
   - For example, if `l = [1, 3, 6, 8]`, then the differences would be `[2, 3, 2]`, and `d1` would be `{2: 2, 3: 1}`.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the count of occurrences of `y` and `x` in `d1`.
   - Since `x` and `y` are described as the last pair of integers read from the input, and they represent differences between elements in `l`, we need to consider their values in the context of `d1`.

Given the information:
- `x` and `y` are specific differences between elements in the list `l`.
- `d1` keeps track of how many times each difference appears in `l`.

Let's denote:
- `count_y`: The number of times the difference `y` appears in the list `l` (i.e., `d1[y]`).
- `count_x`: The number of times the difference `x` appears in the list `l` (i.e., `d1[x]`).

Thus, the output of the print statement will be the difference between these two counts.

Output: **count_y - count_x (where count_y is the number of times y appears in the list l and count_x is the number of times x appears in the list l)**
