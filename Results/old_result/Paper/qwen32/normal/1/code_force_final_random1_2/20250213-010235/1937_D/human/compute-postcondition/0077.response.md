Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `l` is 0
- `r` is 4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `l` is not less than `r`
- `r` is not equal to 0

Code Snippet:
```python
a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
```

Let's break down the calculation:

- `r` is 4, so `r - 1` is 3.
- `B[r - 1]` is `B[3]`, which is 6.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is `idx_B[3]`, which is 0.
- `s[i]` is `'>'`, but `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we assume `i` is a variable that needs to be considered in the expression.
- The expression `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` becomes `(0 - i) * 4`, which simplifies to `-4 * i`.
- Therefore, `a = 6 + (-4 * i)`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `a`. However, we know the expression for `a`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]; `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]; `l` is 0; `r` is 4; `n` is greater than 0; `s[i]` is `'>'; `l` is not less than `r`; `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `6 - 4 * i`.**
