Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the game's mechanics or determine the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.

Here are some key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Assumption**: The function assumes that if the smallest pile is not 1, Alice wins, which is not necessarily true. The game's outcome depends on the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes, not just the size of the smallest pile.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program attempts to use a sequence check (`set_` and its differences) to determine the winner, which is not aligned with the game's rules. The correct approach involves calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.

3. **Nim-Sum Calculation**: In this type of game, the winner can be determined by calculating the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero at the start, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins, assuming both play optimally.

Here's a corrected version of the program using the Nim-sum approach:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().rstrip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    
    # Calculate the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes)
    nim_sum = 0
    for a in arr:
        nim_sum ^= a
    
    # Determine the winner based on the Nim-sum
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This program reads the input, calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes for each test case, and prints the correct winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
