The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without any reference to any variables or conditions within the initial state. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, or `j`.

Based on the precondition and the code snippet, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
