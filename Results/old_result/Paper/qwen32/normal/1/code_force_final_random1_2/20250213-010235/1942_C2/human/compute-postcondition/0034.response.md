Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations; `tmp` is a list of half the even differences where the condition on `y` was satisfied; `y` is the remaining value after all decrements; the sum of `a[0]`, `n`, and the negative of `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2**
