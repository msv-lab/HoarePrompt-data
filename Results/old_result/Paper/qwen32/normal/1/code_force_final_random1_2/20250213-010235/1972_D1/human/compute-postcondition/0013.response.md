To determine the output state, we need to follow the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers.
- `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
return ans - 1
```

Based on the initial state, we know:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `i` is calculated as `ceil(sqrt(n + 1))`.
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` ranging from 1 to `i - 1`.

The final return statement subtracts 1 from `ans`.

Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + 1`.**
