Postcondition: **arr is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element t is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles n and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates. If the current value of not_c is True, then A is True and not_c remains True. Otherwise, A remains False and not_c remains False.**
