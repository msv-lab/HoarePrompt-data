To determine if the given program is correct, we need to carefully analyze the logic behind it and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero. Otherwise, Bob wins.
2. **Objective**: Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.
3. **Numbers**: Each number in the sequence is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Bitwise XOR properties:
     - 1 XOR 1 = 0
     - 2 XOR 2 = 0
     - 3 XOR 3 = 0
     - 4 XOR 4 = 0
     - 1 XOR 2 = 3
     - 1 XOR 3 = 2
     - 1 XOR 4 = 5 (but since we're dealing with numbers up to 4, this becomes 1)
     - 2 XOR 3 = 1
     - 2 XOR 4 = 6 (but since we're dealing with numbers up to 4, this becomes 2)
     - 3 XOR 4 = 7 (but since we're dealing with numbers up to 4, this becomes 3)
4. **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. For the XOR of a set of numbers to be zero, the count of each bit position across all numbers must be even.
5. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**: Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers have an even count of each bit position.

### Key Observations:
- If the initial sequence has an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, then the XOR of the entire sequence is non-zero (Alice wins initially).
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to create sequences with an even number of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- The number of 4s does not affect the XOR result because 4 in binary is 100, and it does not interfere with the lower bits (1s, 2s, and 3s).

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line reads the input and converts each count to the nearest even number. However, this transformation is incorrect for the problem's requirements. It should not modify the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`: This line checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd and adds half of the total count of all numbers. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
