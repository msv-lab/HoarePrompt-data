Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the total number of integers), `na` (a positive integer representing the size of the first group), `nb` (a positive integer representing the size of the second group), `nc` (a positive integer representing the size of the third group), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). If `na + nb + nc` equals `n`, the function returns a tuple containing 'YES', `group_a` (the first `na` elements of `numbers`), `group_b` (the next `nb` elements of `numbers`), and `group_c` (the last `nc` elements of `numbers`). Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
