Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` which is the number of test cases (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating some property or result derived from the permutation `p`.**
