The given code snippet calculates the ASCII difference between the character `ss` and the character 'a', and assigns this difference to the variable `cur_ss`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
