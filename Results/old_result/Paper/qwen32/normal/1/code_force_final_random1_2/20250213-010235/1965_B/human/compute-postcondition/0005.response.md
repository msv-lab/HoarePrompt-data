The given code snippet writes the return value of `func_14()` (converted to a string) followed by a newline character to the standard output. This action does not modify any variables directly but rather outputs a value. The precondition that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 2 remains unchanged as it is not related to the current code snippet.

Output State: **The return value of `func_14()` (converted to a string) followed by a newline character is written to the standard output. `func_10()` must return a value greater than 2.**
