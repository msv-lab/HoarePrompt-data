To determine the new value of `b` after executing the given line of code, we need to carefully evaluate the expressions and the initial state provided.

Given:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`
- `b` is `A[l - 1]`
- The line of code to execute is `b = b - A[l - r - 1]`

We need to find the new value of `b` after the execution of the line `b = b - A[l - r - 1]`. However, the variables `l` and `r` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `b` without them. 

Since the problem asks us to be as specific as possible and to include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed, we will express the new value of `b` in terms of `l` and `r`.

The original value of `b` is `A[l - 1]`. After the execution of the line `b = b - A[l - r - 1]`, the new value of `b` becomes:
\[ \text{new } b = A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] \]

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`**.
