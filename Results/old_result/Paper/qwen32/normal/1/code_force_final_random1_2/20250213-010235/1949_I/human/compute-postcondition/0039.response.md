Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of integers with length `n` (values depend on `dfs` logic); `tot` is an integer (value depends on `dfs` logic); `bipartite` is a boolean (value depends on `dfs` logic); `ok` is `True` indicating that at least one iteration found a bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`.**
