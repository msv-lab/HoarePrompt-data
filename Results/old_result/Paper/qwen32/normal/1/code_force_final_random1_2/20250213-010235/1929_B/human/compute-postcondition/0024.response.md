To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 * n - 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is the next line from the input file.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 * n - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`:** 
   - `n` is an integer extracted from the string `s`. Since `s` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we know only that it is one of the integers obtained by splitting `s`.
   
2. **Expression `2 * n - 1`:**
   - This expression takes the integer `n`, multiplies it by 2, and then subtracts 1 from the result.

### Output Description:
- The output of the `print` statement will be the result of the expression `2 * n - 1`.
- Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is an integer obtained from splitting and mapping the string s)**
