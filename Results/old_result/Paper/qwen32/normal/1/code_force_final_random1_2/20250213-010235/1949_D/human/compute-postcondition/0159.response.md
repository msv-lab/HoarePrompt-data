The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. However, since `j` is currently `n`, incrementing it would make `j` equal to `n + 1`, which is out of the loop's range. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time with the current state of `j`.

But if we are to consider the state right before the last iteration (when the loop could still execute), `j` would have been `n - 1`. Incrementing `j` by 1 would make `j` equal to `n`, which is within the loop's range.

So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `n`.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`**
