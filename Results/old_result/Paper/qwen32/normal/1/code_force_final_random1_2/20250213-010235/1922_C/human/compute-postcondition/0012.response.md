To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 2
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0
- The condition involving `d1[2]` is based on the difference between consecutive elements in `l`, but this does not affect the loop head.

Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n - 2`, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0 (which is outside the range of the loop). For the loop to start executing, `i` should be set to 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0**
