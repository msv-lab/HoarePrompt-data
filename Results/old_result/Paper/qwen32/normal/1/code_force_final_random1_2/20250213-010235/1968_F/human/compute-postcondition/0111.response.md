The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `t` is `t - 1`; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 5`; `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string; `n` is at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index 1 is `int(data[idx - 2])` and the element at index 2 is `int(data[idx - 1])`; all other elements are 0; `pf` is a list where `pf[1] = pf[0] ^ a[1]`; `i` is 2; `mp[pf[1]]` is `[1]`.**
