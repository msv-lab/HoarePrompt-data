The code sorts the string `s` in reverse alphabetical order and assigns the result to `c`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, and the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2; `b` is the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order; `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order.**
