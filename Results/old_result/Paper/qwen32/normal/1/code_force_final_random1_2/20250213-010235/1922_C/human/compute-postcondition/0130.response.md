The given line of code updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2`. Specifically, it sets `d1[i + 2]` to the value of `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `m + 2`
- `n` is greater than 2
- `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is `m-1`
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input

The only change made by the code is to the `d1` dictionary at the key `i + 2`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d1[2]` is 1, and `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
