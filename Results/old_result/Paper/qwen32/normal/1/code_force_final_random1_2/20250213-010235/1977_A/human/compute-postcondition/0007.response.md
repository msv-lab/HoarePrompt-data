Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, meaning it will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'No'`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are described in the initial state but are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
