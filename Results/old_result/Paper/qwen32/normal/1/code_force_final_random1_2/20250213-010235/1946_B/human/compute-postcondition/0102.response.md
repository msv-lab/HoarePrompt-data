Let's break down the given initial state and determine the value of `sm` that will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List `suf`**: 
   - This list contains cumulative sums of another list `l`.
   - Specifically, `suf[0] = 0`, `suf[1] = l[0]`, `suf[2] = l[0] + l[1]`, and so on until `suf[n] = sum(l)`.

2. **List `smin`**:
   - This list is constructed such that each element is the minimum value between the corresponding element in `suf` and the previous element in `smin`.
   - `smin[0] = 0`
   - For `i > 0`, `smin[i] = suf[i] if suf[i] < smin[i-1] else smin[i-1]`.

3. **Variable `sm`**:
   - If `sm` is initially less than 0, it gets updated to `sm + ((-sm) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
     - This formula effectively rounds `sm` up to the nearest multiple of 10.
   - If `sm` is not less than 0, it gets updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.
     - Here, `suf[n]` is the sum of all elements in `l`.

### Determining the Value of `sm`:

Given the two possible update rules for `sm`, we need to consider both cases:

1. **Case 1: `sm` is initially less than 0**:
   - Suppose `sm = -k` where `k` is a positive integer.
   - The update rule becomes `sm = -k + ((k // 10 + 1) * 10)`.
   - This rounds `-k` up to the nearest multiple of 10.

2. **Case 2: `sm` is initially not less than 0**:
   - The update rule becomes `sm = (2 + suf[n]) % 10`.
   - Since `suf[n]` is the sum of all elements in `l`, this computes the remainder when `2 + sum(l)` is divided by 10.

### Conclusion:

Without specific values for `sm` and `l`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `sm`. However, we can describe the value of `sm` based on the conditions given.

- If `sm` is initially less than 0, it will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.
- If `sm` is initially not less than 0, it will be the remainder of `(2 + sum(l))` divided by 10.

Thus, the output will depend on the initial value of `sm` and the contents of `l`.

### Final Output:

Output: **sm (where sm is updated to the nearest multiple of 10 if initially less than 0, otherwise sm is (2 + sum(l)) % 10)**
