Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state:

- Initial State: 
  - `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
  - `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
  - `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
  - `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - `l` is greater than 0
  - `r` is 3
  - `n` is greater than 0
  - `s[i]` is not equal to '>'
  - `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
  - `b` is 6
  - `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  b = b - B[r - l]
  ```

Since `r` is 3 and `l` is greater than 0, we know `r - l` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 3 (because `r` is 3). Let's assume `l` is 1 for the sake of calculation (as `l` being greater than 0 could be any value, but we need a concrete example).

- Calculation:
  - If `l` is 1, then `r - l` is `3 - 1` which equals 2.
  - `B[2]` is 3 (from the list `B`).
  - `b` is initially 6.
  - After executing the code snippet, `b` becomes `6 - 3` which equals 3.

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is 3, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is greater than 0, `r` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is 3, and `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.**
