### Reasoning:
To solve the problem optimally, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers such that the sum of the minimum values of these pairs is maximized. Given that we can choose any two numbers and add the smaller one to our score, sorting the list of numbers provides a straightforward way to ensure we always pick the smallest available numbers first. By sorting the list and summing up every second element starting from the first (i.e., the elements at even indices), we effectively pick the smallest number from each pair.

Here's why the provided program works correctly:
1. **Sorting**: The list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest numbers come first.
2. **Pair Selection**: By iterating through the sorted list and picking every second element starting from the first, we are essentially picking the smaller number from each pair.
3. **Score Calculation**: Summing these selected numbers gives us the maximum possible score because we are always adding the smallest available number from each pair.

The annotated state of the program confirms that for each test case, the function correctly calculates the score by summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list, which aligns with the optimal strategy described above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the optimal solution for the problem.
