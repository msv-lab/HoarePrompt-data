The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `final` was described as `[0, 1]` but with a length of `0`, which seems contradictory. However, based on the provided code, we will consider the list `final` as initially empty (`[]`) since its length is specified as `0`.

After appending `0` to `final`, the list `final` will now be `[0]`.

The values of `c1` and its condition (`c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is greater than or equal to `50`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`final` is `[0]`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is greater than or equal to `50`.**
