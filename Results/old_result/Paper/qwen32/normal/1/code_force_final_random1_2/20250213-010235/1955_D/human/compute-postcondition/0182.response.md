The given line of code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt_b` is a dictionary where keys are elements from `b` and values are their respective counts in the last `m` elements of `a`, except `cnt_b[i]` which is `m`.
- `i` is `m-1`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `curr` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are greater than 0.
- `k` are input integers.
- `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `a[i]` is in `b_values`.

After executing `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will decrease by 1. Since `i` is `m-1`, `a[i]` refers to the last element in the sublist of `a` that `cnt_b` tracks.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` is now `m-1` (since it was `m` before).
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of the original `a` except `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` is now `m-1`, `i` is `m-1`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` are the input integers, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input, and `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
