Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- The robot starts at position (1, 1).
- The robot has two moves every second: 
  1. It can move in one of four directions (left, right, up, down), but cannot move outside the grid.
  2. After moving, it must follow the direction of the arrow in the new cell.
- We need to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

### Key Observations:
- Since the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n), it must eventually move down to row 2.
- The robot can only move down if it is in column `i` of row 1 and the arrow in cell (1, i) points to the right (`>`), and the arrow in cell (2, i) points to the right (`>`).
- Similarly, if the robot is in column `i` of row 2 and wants to move up, the arrow in cell (2, i) must point to the left (`<`), and the arrow in cell (1, i) must point to the left (`<`).
- If there is a column where the arrows in both rows point in opposite directions (one `<` and the other `>`), the robot cannot pass through this column without getting stuck or moving out of bounds.

### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates through every second column starting from column 1 (i.e., columns 1, 3, 5, ...).
- For each column `i`, it checks if:
  - The arrow in column `i` of row 1 (`a[i]`) and the arrow in column `i+1` of row 2 (`b[i+1]`) are both `<`.
  - Or if the arrow in column `i` of row 1 (`a[i]`) and the arrow in column `i-1` of row 2 (`b[i-1]`) are both `<`.
- If either condition is met, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
- If none of these conditions are met for all relevant columns, it prints "Yes".

### Issues with the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the movement logic.
- It only checks for specific patterns of arrows in certain columns but does not simulate the actual movement of the robot.
- The program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up and down between rows based on the arrows.
- The program incorrectly assumes that the presence of certain arrow patterns in specific columns means the robot cannot reach the target.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the provided rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
