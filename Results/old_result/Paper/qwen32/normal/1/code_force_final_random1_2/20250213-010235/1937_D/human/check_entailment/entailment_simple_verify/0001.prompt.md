You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid with `n` cells, where each cell contains either a `<` or a `>` character. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in its current cell, and the character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves. The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

### Program Analysis

The provided program appears to use a more complex approach involving two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results related to the positions of `<` and `>` characters. Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - Two lists, `A` and `B`, are used to store cumulative distances related to the positions of `>` and `<` characters, respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to store the indices of `>` and `<` characters.

3. **Calculating Distances:**
   - For each cell, the program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative distances stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The program uses different formulas depending on whether the current character is `>` or `<`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated times for each cell in the grid.

### Correctness Check

While the program seems to follow a structured approach, there are several issues that suggest it may not be correct:

- **Complexity and Logic:** The logic used in the program is quite complex and involves multiple nested conditions and calculations. This complexity makes it difficult to verify the correctness without a thorough understanding of the underlying mathematical model.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as grids with only `>` or only `<` characters, or grids where the pinball might bounce back and forth between two cells.
- **Output Formatting:** The program prints the results for each test case on the same line, separated by spaces, but it also includes an extra `print()` statement after processing each test case, which could lead to incorrect formatting in the output.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity of the program and the lack of clear documentation or comments explaining the logic, it is challenging to definitively state that the program is correct. However, based on the provided example, the program seems to produce the correct output. To ensure correctness, further testing with a variety of test cases and a deeper analysis of the logic would be necessary.

Since the problem statement guarantees that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps and the provided example matches the expected output, we can tentatively assume that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
