Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `i` is 4. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `tmp` contains the additional element `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2`, `ans` is updated by adding `tmp` to its previous value, and `y` is decreased by `((a[4] - a[3]) // 2) - 1`. Otherwise, these variables remain unchanged.**
