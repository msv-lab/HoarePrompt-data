The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by setting the bit at the position specified by `cur_ss` to 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur`. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1, which means `cur` is updated to its current value plus `1 << cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1, so `cur` is now `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
