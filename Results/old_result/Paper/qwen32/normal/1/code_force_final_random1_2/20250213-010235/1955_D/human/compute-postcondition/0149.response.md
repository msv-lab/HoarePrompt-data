Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, and the count of `a[m + 2]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `i` is set to `m + 1`. Otherwise, `i` remains `m + 2`. `n` is greater than `m`; `m` and `k` remain unchanged; `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `b_values` remains unchanged.**
