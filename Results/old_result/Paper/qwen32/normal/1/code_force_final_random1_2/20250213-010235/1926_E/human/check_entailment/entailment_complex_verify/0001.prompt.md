You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

        L = []

            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: t is 0, n is 0, k is the last input integer, L is the list of values calculated for m until n is reduced to 0 for the last iteration, pow is \(2^{\text{len}(L)}\) for the last iteration, tot is the sum of all elements in L for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).

2. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - The program aims to generate the sequence of cards according to the rules specified.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` which will store the counts of cards in each group.
   - It uses a loop to calculate these counts:
     - `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the number of odd-numbered cards (or the first group of cards).
     - `n -= m` reduces the total number of cards by the number of cards just counted.
     - `L.append(m)` adds the count to the list `L`.
     - This loop continues until all cards are accounted for (`while n`).

3. **Determining the k-th Card**:
   - The program initializes `tot` (total count of cards processed so far) and `pow` (a multiplier used to determine the card value).
   - It iterates over the list `L`:
     - For each element `a` in `L`, it checks if `k` falls within the current segment of cards.
     - If `tot < k <= tot + a`, it prints the card value using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
     - It updates `tot` by adding `a` and multiplies `pow` by 2 to move to the next group of cards.

### Verification Against the Problem Description

- **Sequence Generation**:
  - The logic `(n + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the number of odd-numbered cards in the first group.
  - The subsequent groups are handled by reducing `n` and recalculating the count, which aligns with the problem's requirement to lay down cards in multiples of odd numbers.

- **Card Value Calculation**:
  - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly identifies the k-th card in the sequence.
  - `pow` starts at 1 and doubles with each group, reflecting the multiples of odd numbers.
  - `(2 * (k - tot) - 1)` generates the correct odd-numbered card within the current group.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles small values of `n` and `k` correctly.
  - It also handles large values of `n` and `k` efficiently due to the logarithmic nature of the sequence generation.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the k-th card in the sequence as described in the problem statement. It handles both small and large inputs efficiently and accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
