Let's break down the initial state and the given conditions:

- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`.
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[0]` is decreased by 1.
- `start` is initialized to `0`.
- `vis` is a set containing the value `0`.
- `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is `0`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print(start + 1)
```

From the initial state, we know that `start` is `0`. Therefore, `start + 1` evaluates to `1`.

Thus, the `print` statement will output the value `1`.

Output: **1**
