Output State: **`t` is an integer that was initially read from input minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If `a` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`, provided `a1` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is odd, no changes are made to `a1` and `a2`. `b1` and `b2` are both equal to `b // 2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or their values. Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
