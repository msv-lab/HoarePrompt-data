The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1.

Given the initial state, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, which means `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Therefore, the value associated with `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will be decreased by 1.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`, except the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1. `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` are integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0.**
