The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0, which overrides its previous value. The initial value of `cnt` and the calculations involving `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4` are no longer relevant because `cnt` is explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is 0.**
