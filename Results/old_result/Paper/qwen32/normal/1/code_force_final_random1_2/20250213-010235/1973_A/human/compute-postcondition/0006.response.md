Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `total_points` is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` remains an empty list.**
