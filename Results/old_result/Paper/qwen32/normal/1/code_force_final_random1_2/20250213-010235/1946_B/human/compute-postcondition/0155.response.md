To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers.
   
2. **Suffix Sum Calculation (`suf`)**:
   - `suf` is initialized with `[0]`.
   - For each element in `l`, the cumulative sum is computed and appended to `suf`.

3. **Minimum Suffix Calculation (`smin`)**:
   - `smin` is initialized with `[0]`.
   - For each element in `suf` (except the first), the minimum value between the current suffix sum and the previous minimum is appended to `smin`.

4. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation (`sm`)**:
   - `sm` is initialized to `-111`.
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `n`, the difference `suf[i] - smin[i]` is computed. If this difference is greater than the current `sm`, `sm` is updated.
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum, `sm` is transformed using the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`.
   - Finally, `sm` is adjusted by adding `suf[n]`.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - If `sm` is negative, it is adjusted to be positive using modulo operation with `10^9 + 7`.
   - If `sm` is non-negative, it is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Output**:
   - The final value of `sm` is printed for each test case.

### Output State After All Iterations:
After all `t` iterations, the output state will be the result of processing each test case independently and printing the final `sm` for each one. Since each iteration processes a separate test case, the state of variables like `suf`, `smin`, and `sm` will reset at the start of each new test case.

### Final Output State:
The final output state will be a series of printed values, one for each test case. Each value is the final `sm` after processing the corresponding test case.

### Conclusion:
Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, we need to consider the final printed values for all test cases.

**Output State:** **A series of printed values, each representing the final `sm` for each test case after processing all iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after all iterations is a sequence of numbers, where each number corresponds to the final result of the computation for each test case, formatted according to the rules specified in the loop.
