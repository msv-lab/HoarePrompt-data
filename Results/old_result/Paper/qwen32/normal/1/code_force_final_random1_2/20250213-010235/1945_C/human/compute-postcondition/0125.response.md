The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `final` is either `[elem]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` remains `[]`. After appending `elem` to `final`, the new state of `final` will be `[elem, elem]` if the condition was initially met, or `[elem]` if the condition was not initially met.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`mini` is `min(100000000, n / 2)`, `final` is `[elem, elem]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` is `[elem]`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered up to the second last character, `one` is the total count of '1's encountered up to the second last character, `lst` is `[0, 1]`.**
