To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the elements of the list `b`. The loop iterates over each element `y` in `b` and appends its integer value to `b_values`. Given the information provided, we can infer that the loop will continue until all elements in `b` have been processed.

From the previous output states, we know:
- `i` is incremented by 1 once at the start of the loop.
- `x` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `num_fila` is set to the integer value of `nf[0]`.
- `max_p` is set to the integer value of `nf[1]`.
- `a_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `a`.
- `b_values` accumulates the integer values of each `y` from `b`.
- `nf` is a list of substrings from the input.
- `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.
- `custo` remains 0 throughout the loop.

After the loop has executed all iterations, `b_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in `b`. Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `b_values` will include all the integer values from the list `b`, while all other variables will remain in their initial states except for `i` which is incremented by 1.
