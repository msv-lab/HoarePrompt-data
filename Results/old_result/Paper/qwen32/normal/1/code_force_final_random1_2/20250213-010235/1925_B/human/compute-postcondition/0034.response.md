Postcondition: **`ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i` since `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, divisible by `i`, and `x // i` is greater than 0. `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `x` is divisible by `i`.**
