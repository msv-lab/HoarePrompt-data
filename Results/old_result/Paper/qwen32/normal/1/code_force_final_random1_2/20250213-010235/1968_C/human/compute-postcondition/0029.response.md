The code snippet `a = [0] * n` changes the list `a` to a new list containing `n` zeros. The initial state of `a` where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` is overwritten by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the input integer, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` zeros.**
