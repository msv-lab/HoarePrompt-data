To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `x`:

Given:
- `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`
- `s[i]` is `<`
- `B` is not empty
- `idx_B` is not empty
- `n` must be greater than 0

Let's break down the expression for `x`:

1. `B[len(B) - 1]`: This is the last element of list `B`.
2. `idx_B[len(B) - 1]`: This is the last element of list `idx_B`.
3. `len(idx_B)`: This is the length of list `idx_B`.

Putting it all together:
- `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`

Since the exact values of `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `j` are not specified, we can only express `x` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is not empty, `idx_B` is not empty, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `s[i]` is `<`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`**

In natural language: The value of `x` is calculated as the last element of `B` plus the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `(n - 1 - j)`, and the length of `idx_B`. All other variables remain unchanged.
