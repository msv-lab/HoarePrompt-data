To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for tc in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which iterates over the range defined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), no adjustment is needed for `t` itself since it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, we should clarify the state of `tc` as it will be initialized by the loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 500\); the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop.**

Note that `n`, `m`, and the grid do not affect the execution of the outer loop directly, but they are part of the overall program state. Since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `t` and `tc`.
