Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where the first two tuples have non-empty lists as their second elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, and `a` is the second element of `test`, `current_year` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where the first two tuples have non-empty lists as their second elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and is a non-empty list, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where the first two tuples have non-empty lists as their second elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and is a non-empty list, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where the first two tuples have non-empty lists as their second elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and is a non-empty list, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `ai` is `a[j+1]`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
