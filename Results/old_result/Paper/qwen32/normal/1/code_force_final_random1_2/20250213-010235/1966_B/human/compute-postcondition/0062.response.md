The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement `for j in range(m - 1):`, the loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was used in the condition checks involving `gr[0][j]` and `gr[n - 1][j]`. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'YES'`, `i` is `n - 1`. If either `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `j` is `j + 1`**
