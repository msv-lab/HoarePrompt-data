Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input. The variable `t` will still represent the total number of test cases, which must be non-negative. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of `a` and `b` read during the loop's execution.
