### Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a specific order. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in ascending or descending order because the largest possible differences will be between the smallest and largest elements.

However, the provided program calculates only the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` after sorting), which is not necessarily the maximum beauty. The maximum beauty is actually achieved by maximizing the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements when the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order.

For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. When sorted in ascending order, it becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is calculated as `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`, which matches the expected output.

The provided program does not correctly compute this sum of differences but instead computes only the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum beauty.
