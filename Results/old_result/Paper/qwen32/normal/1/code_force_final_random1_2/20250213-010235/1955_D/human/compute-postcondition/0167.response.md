The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, but does not change the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now 0 for every `i` in `b_values`, `i` is the last element of `b_values`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was `>= k` during the loop, `curr` is the count of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that are in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k` are the input integers, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged. The loop is set to execute one more time based on the user input.**
