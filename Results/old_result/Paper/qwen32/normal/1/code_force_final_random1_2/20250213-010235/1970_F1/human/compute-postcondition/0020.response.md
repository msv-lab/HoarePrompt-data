Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`. If `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then `elements` is updated to include `line[ind]: (i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers` is `{line[ind]: False}`; otherwise, `allPlayers` remains `{}`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[0]` if `tmp` is `0` (when `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`), or to `goal[1]` if `tmp` is `1` (when `line[ind][0]` is not `'B'`). `points` remains `[0, 0]`.**
