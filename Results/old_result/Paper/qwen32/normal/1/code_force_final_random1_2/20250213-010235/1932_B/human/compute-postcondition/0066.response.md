The code appends `current_year` to the list `results`. Given that `current_year` is already the LCM of all elements in `a` and is included as the last element of `results`, appending `current_year` again means `results` will now have an additional occurrence of `current_year` at the end.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`; `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last two elements; `test` is the next element in `test_cases`; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test`.**
