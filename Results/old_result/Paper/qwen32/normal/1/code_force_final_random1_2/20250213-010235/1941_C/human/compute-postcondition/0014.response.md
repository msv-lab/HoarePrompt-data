The code snippet `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to the new string value read from the user input. The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `a` is the new integer value read from the user input, `s` is the new string value read from the user input, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
