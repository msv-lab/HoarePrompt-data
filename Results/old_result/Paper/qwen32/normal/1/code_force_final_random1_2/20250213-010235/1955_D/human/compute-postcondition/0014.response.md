The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0.**
