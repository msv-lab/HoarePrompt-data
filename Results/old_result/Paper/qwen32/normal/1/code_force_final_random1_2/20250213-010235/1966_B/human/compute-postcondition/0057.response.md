Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; `i` is `n - 1`; `impossible` is `True`.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code snippet is the assignment of `True` to the variable `impossible`. All other variables retain their initial values.
