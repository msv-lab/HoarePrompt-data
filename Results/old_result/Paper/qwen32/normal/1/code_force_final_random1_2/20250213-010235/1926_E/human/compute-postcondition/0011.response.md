The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the list `L` now contains its original element `m` followed by another `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is `[m, m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
