### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in a given grid the same color using the allowed operations. The logic of the program is based on the observation that if the top-left corner and bottom-right corner of the grid have different colors, then the only way to make the entire grid the same color is if the top row and the bottom row are uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'), and similarly, the leftmost column and the rightmost column must also be uniform.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initial Check**: If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have the same color, the program assumes that it might be possible to make the entire grid the same color and sets `ans` to 'YES'.

2. **Corner Color Mismatch**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, the program then checks if the entire top row and the entire bottom row are uniform. If they are not, it sets `impossible` to `False` and keeps `ans` as 'YES'. However, if both the top row and the bottom row are uniform, it sets `impossible` to `True`.

3. **Column Check**: Similarly, the program checks if the entire left column and the entire right column are uniform. If they are not, it sets `impossible` to `False` and keeps `ans` as 'YES'. However, if both the left column and the right column are uniform, it sets `impossible` to `True`.

4. **Final Decision**: If `impossible` remains `True` after checking both the rows and columns, it means that the grid cannot be made uniform with the given operations, and `ans` is set to 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic correctly identifies scenarios where it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. Specifically, if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, and either the top/bottom rows or the left/right columns are not uniform, then it's indeed impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as grids with a single row or a single column, and grids where all cells are already the same color.

- **Complexity**: The program efficiently processes each test case in O(n + m) time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
