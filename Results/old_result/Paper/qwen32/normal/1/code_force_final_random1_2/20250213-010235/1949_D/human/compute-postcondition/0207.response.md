Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[n] == 0` and `b[n] == 0`, then `sb` includes the index `n`. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`.**
