Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` was initially 0, `r` remains `r_initial - 1`. If `r` was not initially 0, `r` is `r_initial - 1` and `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`. Additionally, if `r_initial` is 2 and `l` is 1, `b` is -8.**
