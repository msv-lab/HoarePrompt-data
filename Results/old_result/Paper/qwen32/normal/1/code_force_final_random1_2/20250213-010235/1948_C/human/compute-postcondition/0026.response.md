Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input values, and either `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` and both equal `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` and both equal `<`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition involving `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` still holds true. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
