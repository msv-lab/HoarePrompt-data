The code snippet `x = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `x` to be a new list containing `n` elements, each set to `None`. This means the original list `x` (which contained the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks) is replaced by this new list.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers where `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk; `r` is a list of integers where `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk, with `-10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9` and `1 <= r[i] <= 10^9` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`; `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**
