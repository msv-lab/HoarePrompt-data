Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`, and the conditions specified in the else part hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m-1` are integers obtained from the input, where `m-1` must be greater than or equal to 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the program follows the if part logic; otherwise, it follows the else part logic, which in this case does not change any of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the program follows the if part logic; otherwise, it follows the else part logic, which in this case does not change any of the variables. `a` and `b` have been updated to the values obtained from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
