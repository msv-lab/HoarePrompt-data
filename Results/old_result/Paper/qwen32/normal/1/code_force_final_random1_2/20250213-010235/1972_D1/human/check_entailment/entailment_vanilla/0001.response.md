To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to carefully analyze the code and see if it implements the logic required by the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis
Let's examine the provided functions to see if they address the problem:

- **func_1 to func_11**: These functions are utility functions for reading input and output. They do not contain any logic related to solving the problem.
- **func_12 to func_14**: These functions seem to be unrelated to the problem. They appear to be solving a different problem involving graphs or some other data structure.
- **func_15**: This function seems to be attempting to solve the problem. Let's analyze its logic.
- **func_16**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, which suggests that `func_15` should be the main logic for solving the problem.

#### Analysis of `func_15`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) using a loop and a condition that involves the square root of `n + i`. However, the logic does not directly match the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness Check
The provided solution does not seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for the gcd condition properly.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
