The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is `opNum`, so after the operation, `a[i]` will be `opNum - opNum`, which equals 0.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numTest` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now 0 (previously `opNum`), `a[i+1]` is 0, and `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
- `opNum` is `a[i]` (which was `opNum` before the operation, and now `a[i]` is 0).
- `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0 (which it wasn't, since `a[i]` was `opNum`), otherwise `stop` remains False.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i+1]` is 0, and `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` remains False; `i` is incremented by 1.**
