Postcondition: **`p` is equal to `j`, the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`. `s` has at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `s` after the current `i`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
