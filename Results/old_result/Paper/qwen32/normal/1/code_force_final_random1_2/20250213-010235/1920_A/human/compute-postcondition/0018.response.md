Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `v` is the second integer from the input, `t` can be either 1, 2, or 3, `start` is -1 if `t` is 3 or if `t` is 1 and `start` is not updated (i.e., `start` is less than `v`), otherwise `start` is updated to `v`. `end` is 1000000000.0 if `t` is 3 or if `t` is 2 and `end` is not updated (i.e., `end` is greater than `v`), otherwise `end` is updated to `v`. `num` is `[v]` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains `[]`.**
