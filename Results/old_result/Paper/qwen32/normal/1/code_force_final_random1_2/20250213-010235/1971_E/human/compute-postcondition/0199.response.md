To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined and manipulated.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables with Explicit Values:**
   - `l = 2`
   - `i = 1`
   - `t = t - 1` (This implies `t` was decremented by 1 at some point, but its initial value is not specified.)
   - `n` and `k` are the first and second input integers, respectively.
   - `a` is a list constructed from the input integers, prefixed with `0`: `a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.
   - `b` is another list constructed similarly: `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with `0`: `ad = [0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with `0`: `bd = [0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
   - `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`, starting with `0`: `v = [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.

3. **Dynamic Variables:**
   - `m` is defined by the formula: `m = (m + b[s - 1]) + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
   - `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it: `ql = ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` after the `bisect_left` operation.
   - `q` is a newly input integer.
   - If `a[s] == ql`, the state remains unchanged.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space. To determine the exact value of `m`, we need to trace back its computation:

- `m` is initially undefined in the provided initial state, so we assume it has been computed earlier in the code.
- The formula for `m` involves `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it, and `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.

Given the complexity and the fact that `m` is dependent on multiple variables (`b`, `bd`, `ql`, `ad`), we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `m` without knowing the specific input values for `a`, `b`, and `q`.

However, we can describe the value of `m` precisely based on the given information:

### Final Output Description:

The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`, which is computed using the formula `m = (m + b[s - 1]) + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`, followed by a space.

Output: **int(m) (where m is computed as (m + b[s - 1]) + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s]))**
