Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
- `i` is set to 2, but it is also not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

### Calculation:
1. **Determine `mn`:**
   - `mn = min(a, b) + m`
   - This means `mn` is the smaller of `a` and `b`, plus `m`.

2. **Calculate `mn // a` and `mn // b`:**
   - `mn // a` is the integer division of `mn` by `a`.
   - `mn // b` is the integer division of `mn` by `b`.

3. **Sum the results:**
   - The expression `mn // a + mn // b` adds these two integer divisions together.

### Explanation:
Given the formula for `mn`, the output will be the sum of how many times `a` fits into `mn` and how many times `b` fits into `mn`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `mn` by `b`.

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b (where `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input)**
