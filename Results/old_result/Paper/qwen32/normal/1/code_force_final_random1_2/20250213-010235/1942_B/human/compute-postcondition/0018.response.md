To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step-by-step:

The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first). For each element `ar[i]` at index `i`, it calculates `mex - ar[i]` and assigns it to `res[i]`. If `mex - ar[i]` is less than the current `mex`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

Here’s a summary of the process:
1. Start with `mex = n`.
2. For each element `ar[i]` from the end of the list to the beginning:
   - Calculate `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex - ar[i]` is less than the current `mex`.

After the loop completes, `res` will contain the values calculated as described above, and `mex` will reflect the minimum value encountered during the process.

Let's formalize the final output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `ar` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` during the loop, with `mex` being updated accordingly.
- `mex` is the minimum value that was used during the calculations, reflecting the smallest `mex - ar[i]` encountered.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop, with `mex` being updated during the loop; `mex` is the minimum value encountered during the loop.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `res` contains the differences between the current `mex` and each element of `ar` in reverse order, and `mex` is the smallest value that was used in these calculations.
