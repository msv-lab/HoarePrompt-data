Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 10 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 5` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, the second-to-last element is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`. The third-to-last element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise it is omitted. The last element of `results` is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, the last element of `results` is `'YES'`. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is `'NO'` and an additional `'NO'` is appended to `results`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 6 - n]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 5 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**
