Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_year` is 0; `results` now includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases`; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test`.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_year` is `next_year`; `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current_year` is updated to `next_year`; `next_year` is updated to `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, otherwise `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`; `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element; `ai` is the next element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_year` is updated to `next_year`; `next_year` is updated to `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, otherwise `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`; `results` includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element; `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element; `ai` is the next element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
