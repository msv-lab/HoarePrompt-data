You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the number of iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is the last string processed, `a` is the set of unique characters from the last string `s`, `b` is the last string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the last string `s` sorted in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If it does, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already in lexicographically smallest order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to rearrange the characters of the string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
- If no such string `r` exists, we should output "NO".
- Otherwise, we should output "YES" followed by the rearranged string `r`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking the length of the unique characters in the string `s`. If the length of the unique characters is 2, it outputs "NO" because any rearrangement of a string with only two unique characters will still result in the same sorted order or its reverse, which means it cannot be rearranged to a different string. For other cases, it outputs "YES" and provides a rearranged string.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Strings with only one unique character**: The program handles this correctly by implicitly considering it as a special case of having only two unique characters (since `len(a)` would be 1).
2. **Strings with more than two unique characters**: The program attempts to provide a rearranged string by sorting the string in both ascending and descending order and checking if the original string matches either of these sorted versions. If the original string matches the ascending sorted version, it outputs the descending sorted version, and vice versa. This logic works for many cases but might not cover all edge cases effectively.

### Edge Case Consideration:
Consider the following edge case:
- Input: `aaabbb`
- The program will sort the string to get `aaabbb` (ascending) and `bbbbaa` (descending). Since the original string `aaabbb` matches the ascending sorted version, it will output `bbbbaa`, which is correct.
- However, let's consider another case: `aabaaa`. Sorting this gives `aaaaab` and `baaaaa`. The original string `aabaaa` matches neither of these sorted versions, so the program will output one of them, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it seems to handle the main cases correctly. Specifically:
- It correctly identifies strings that cannot be rearranged to a different string (strings with only one or two unique characters).
- It correctly rearranges strings with more than two unique characters by using sorting.

Given the analysis, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles strings with one or two unique characters by outputting "NO". For strings with more than two unique characters, it rearranges the string by sorting and ensuring the rearranged string is different from the original, thus meeting the problem's requirements.
