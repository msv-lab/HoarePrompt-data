Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers representing the health of each monster, a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, and an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters under the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
