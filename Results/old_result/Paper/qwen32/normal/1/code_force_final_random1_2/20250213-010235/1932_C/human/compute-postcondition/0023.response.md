To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze how the loop operates and how the variables change over time.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and the string `s`.
- In each iteration `i`:
  - If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` of `a` is appended to `b`, and `l` is incremented by 1.
  - If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` of `a` is appended to `b`, and `r` is decremented by 1.

### Final State:
- After `n` iterations, every element of `a` will be appended to `b` exactly once, in the order dictated by the string `s`.
- The variable `l` will be equal to `n` because it increments every time an 'L' is encountered.
- The variable `r` will be equal to `-1` because it decrements every time an 'R' is encountered.

### Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the input list `a`.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not used within the loop.
- `a` remains unchanged as its elements are only read, not modified.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified.
- `b` will contain all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`.
- `l` will be equal to `n`.
- `r` will be equal to `-1`.

### Final Output State in Specified Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`.**

### Human-readable Explanation:
After the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, the list `b` will contain all elements from the list `a` in the order determined by the string `s`. The variable `l` will be equal to `n` because it counts the number of 'L' operations, and `r` will be `-1` because it counts the number of 'R' operations in reverse. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
