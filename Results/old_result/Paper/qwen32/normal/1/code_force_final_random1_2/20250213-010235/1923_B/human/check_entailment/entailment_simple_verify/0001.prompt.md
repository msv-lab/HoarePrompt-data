You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

    YES

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine whether we can kill all `n` monsters before any of them reach the character at position 0. We have `k` bullets per second, and each bullet can reduce the health of a single monster by 1. After shooting, any monster with health 0 or less dies, and all remaining monsters move one step towards the character.

### Key Points:
1. **Order of Shooting**: The strategy involves shooting monsters in an optimal order to maximize the chances of killing them before they reach the character.
2. **Distance Consideration**: Monsters closer to the character pose an immediate threat, so they should be prioritized.
3. **Health Management**: We need to ensure that we have enough bullets to kill each monster before it reaches the character.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(a, x, k)`
- **Sorting**: The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character (`abs(x[i])`). This ensures that we consider the closest monsters first.
- **Loop through Monsters**: It iterates through the sorted list of monsters, checking if any monster is at distance 0 (i.e., has reached the character). If so, it returns `False`.
- **Shooting Bullets**: For each distance, it uses up to `k` bullets to reduce the health of the monsters at that distance. If a monster's health drops to 0, it is considered dead and removed from further consideration.
- **Increment Distance**: After processing all monsters at the current distance, it increments the distance and continues.

#### Function `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: This function reads the input for multiple test cases, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

### Potential Issues
1. **Sorting by Distance**: Sorting by absolute distance (`abs(x[i])`) is a good strategy because it prioritizes the closest monsters. However, it doesn't account for the order in which monsters move towards the character.
2. **Handling Multiple Monsters at Same Distance**: The code correctly handles multiple monsters at the same distance by using up to `k` bullets to reduce their health.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code seems to handle edge cases like a single monster or all monsters having the same health and position correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided program appears to follow a logical approach to solve the problem. It prioritizes shooting the closest monsters and ensures that the health of each monster is reduced appropriately before they reach the character. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program seems to be correct.
