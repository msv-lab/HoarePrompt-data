Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` was initially greater than the new `total`, then `best` is updated to the new `total`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
