To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(4 < t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is \(\log_2(t)\) where \(t > 4\)
- `power` is 3

We need to ensure that `power < n` holds true for the loop to execute one more time.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Values**:
   - `power` is 3.
   - `n` is \(\log_2(t)\).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `power < n`.
   - Given `power` is 3, we need \(3 < \log_2(t)\).

3. **Adjusting `n`**:
   - To satisfy \(3 < \log_2(t)\), we need \(t > 2^3\).
   - Therefore, \(t > 8\).

Since `t` is already given to be greater than 4, we need to ensure it is greater than 8 to guarantee that \(3 < \log_2(t)\).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be adjusted to be greater than 8. No other variables in the loop condition (`power` and `n`) need to be directly adjusted because adjusting `t` will appropriately adjust `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(8 < t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is \(\log_2(t)\) where \(t > 8\), `power` is 3**
