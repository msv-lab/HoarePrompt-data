Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the health of the monster at `sorted_indices[pos]` is now `0`; `x` is unchanged; `k` is greater than 0; `n` is unchanged; `sorted_indices` is unchanged; `distance` is 1; `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` and has been incremented by 1; `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` (before the decrement) and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` (before the decrement). The current value of `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is `0`.**

Natural Language: The position `pos` has been incremented by 1, moving to the next index in `sorted_indices`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, `rest`, and `delta`. The health of the monster at the previously indexed position (`sorted_indices[pos-1]`) remains `0`.
