Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers representing the health of each monster; `x`, which is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster such that -n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n and x_i != 0; and `k`, which is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The function returns the minimum time required to defeat all monsters given the constraints.**
