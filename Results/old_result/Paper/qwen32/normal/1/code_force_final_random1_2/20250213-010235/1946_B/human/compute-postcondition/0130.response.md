The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. This means the length of `smin` increases by one, and the last element of `smin` is now `smin[i]`.

Given the initial state, `smin` is a list where each element is calculated based on the minimum of the subsequent element in `suf` and the current element in `smin`. After appending `smin[i]` to `smin`, the new last element of `smin` will be `smin[i]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), ..., min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), smin[i]]`; `sm` is updated based on the given conditions; `j` is `j + n`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of substrings from the input; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is `i + 1`**.
