Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except possibly `visited[i]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except possibly `coef[i]` which is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` was initially `False`, then `visited[i]` is now `True` and `coef[i]` is `1`. Otherwise, `visited` and `coef` remain unchanged.**
