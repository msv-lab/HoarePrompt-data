The value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The values of `x`, `odd`, `even`, and `next_elem` remain unchanged. Since `next_elem` is defined conditionally based on the value of `i`, we keep its definition intact.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**
