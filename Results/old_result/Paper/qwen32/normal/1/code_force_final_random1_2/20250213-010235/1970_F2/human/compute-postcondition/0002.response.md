Output State: **The program returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of `a` and `b1`, and the second element is the sum of `a` and `b2`. Given that `a` is an integer between 3 and 99 (inclusive) and odd, `b1` is an integer between 3 and 99 (inclusive) and odd, and `b2` is also an integer between 3 and 99 (inclusive) and odd, the returned tuple will contain two sums of these odd integers.**

In simpler terms, Output State: **The program returns (`a + b1`, `a + b2`), where `a`, `b1`, and `b2` are all odd integers between 3 and 99.**
