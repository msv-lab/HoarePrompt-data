Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains the same, `flag` indicates whether there is at least one '0' followed by '1' in the string, and `j` is len(s) - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and `count` is the total number of transitions in the string `s`. If `flag` is True, `count` is decreased by 1 indicating that there is at least one '01' transition in the string `s`. If `flag` is False, `count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of segments in `s` where consecutive characters are different, and `flag` is True indicating there is at least one '01' transition in `s`. If `flag` is True, `count` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
