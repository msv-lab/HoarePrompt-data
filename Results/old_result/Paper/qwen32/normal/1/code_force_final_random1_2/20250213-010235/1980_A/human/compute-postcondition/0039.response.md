Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `missing` value corresponds to a test case defined by a tuple `(n, m, a)` in `test_cases`, where `n` is the length of the string `a`, `m` is an integer, and `a` consists of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list of `missing` values, one for each test case provided in `test_cases`. Each `missing` value is calculated based on the details of its respective test case.
