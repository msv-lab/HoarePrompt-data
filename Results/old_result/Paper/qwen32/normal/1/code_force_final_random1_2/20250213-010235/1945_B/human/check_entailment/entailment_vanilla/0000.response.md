Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and those from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework remains visible for `m + 1` minutes after its launch.

To solve this, we need to consider the intervals during which fireworks from both installations overlap. The key point is to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks visible from each installation up to a certain time (`mn = min(a, b) + m`) and then summing these counts. However, this approach does not correctly account for all possible overlaps between fireworks from different installations.

#### Key Issues:

1. **Overlap Calculation**: The solution does not properly handle the overlap between fireworks from different installations. It simply sums the number of fireworks from each installation without considering the exact timing of their visibility.

2. **Special Cases**: The solution includes a special case where it adds an extra `+1` if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is `1`. This logic is flawed because it does not accurately reflect the actual overlap conditions.

3. **General Case Handling**: The general case (`else` block) also fails to account for the correct number of simultaneous fireworks due to the same reasons as above.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks. We then calculate how many fireworks from each installation are visible within the interval `[0, LCM(a, b) + m]` and adjust for overlaps.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the provided solution, it is clear that the program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The provided solution incorrectly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously due to improper handling of overlaps and special cases.
Correctness: **False**
