To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis))`, so the relevant variables are `j`, `len(lis)`, and `lis`.

Let's analyze the conditions under which the loop will execute:

1. **`len(lis)`**: This represents the length of the list `lis`. For the loop to execute, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1 because the `range` function starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(lis)`. If `len(lis)` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

2. **`lis`**: This is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the map object `l`. Since the length of `lis` determines whether the loop will execute, `lis` must contain more than one element.

3. **`j`**: This variable is the loop variable and is automatically initialized by the `range` function. We don't need to set `j` manually before the loop starts because it will be set to 1 when the loop begins executing (if the loop executes).

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lis` has more than one element. Here’s how we can express this:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `test` is `True`**

This ensures that the condition for the loop to execute (`len(lis) > 1`) is met.
