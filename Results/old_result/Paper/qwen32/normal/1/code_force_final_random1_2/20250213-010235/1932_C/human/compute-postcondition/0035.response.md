To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `p` and `ans`. The loop iterates over the list `b` in reverse order, updating the product `p` modulo `m` and appending the result to the list `ans`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` starts as 1.
   - `ans` is initially an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `v` in the reversed list `b`, `p` is updated to `(p * v) % m`.
   - The new value of `p` is then appended to the list `ans`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`.
   - `ans` will contain the cumulative products modulo `m` at each step of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates `n` times (since `b` has `n` elements), the final state will be:

- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.
- `ans` will be a list of length `n` where each element is the cumulative product modulo `m` at each step.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`; `p` is the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, each taken modulo `m`, and `p` holds the final cumulative product modulo `m`.
