Postcondition: **`ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` (if the first element is not `h`) and any subsequent elements that are less than or equal to `h` after encountering an element equal to `h`. `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` has been encountered, otherwise 0. `j` is 2. `n` is the first integer from the input. `k` is the second integer from the input. `s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1` and must have at least two elements. `h` is the first element of `s`. `i` is the next element in `s[1:]` after the previously processed one. If `h < i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
