Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `b` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`) retain their initial values.
