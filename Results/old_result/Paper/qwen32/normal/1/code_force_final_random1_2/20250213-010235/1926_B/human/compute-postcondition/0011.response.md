Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is a string containing the user input. If `b` contains at least one '1', `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each string `b` processed so far. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.**
