Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value from the input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
