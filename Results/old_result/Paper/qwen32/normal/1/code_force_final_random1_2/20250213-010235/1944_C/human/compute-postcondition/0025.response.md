To determine what will be printed by the `print(start + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`, `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[2]` is greater than 0 if `start` is 2.
- `vis` is a set containing the values `0`, `1`, and `start`.
- The value of `nums[start]` is decreased by 1.

The key piece of information here is the value of `start`. The problem states that `vis` is a set containing `0`, `1`, and `start`. Since `nums[1]` is at least 1, it implies that `start` could be either `0`, `1`, or `2` (given the constraints and the fact that `nums[2]` is greater than 0 only if `start` is 2).

However, since `vis` explicitly includes `0` and `1`, and `start` is also included in `vis`, `start` must be one of the values already in `vis` (i.e., `0`, `1`, or `2`). Given that `nums[1]` is at least 1, `start` could logically be `1` or `2`.

Let's consider the possible values of `start`:
- If `start` is `0`, then `vis` would be `{0, 1, 0}`, which is not valid because sets cannot have duplicate elements.
- If `start` is `1`, then `vis` would be `{0, 1, 1}`, which is also not valid for the same reason.
- Therefore, `start` must be `2`, making `vis` `{0, 1, 2}`, which is valid.

Given that `start` is `2`, the expression `start + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1 = 3`.

Thus, the output of the `print(start + 1)` statement will be:
Output: **3**
