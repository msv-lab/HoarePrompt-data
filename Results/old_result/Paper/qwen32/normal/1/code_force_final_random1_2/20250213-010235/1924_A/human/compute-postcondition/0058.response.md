The given code snippet reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is the string read from the input
- `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence
- `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence
- `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters

After executing the code snippet `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated to the integers read from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters.**
