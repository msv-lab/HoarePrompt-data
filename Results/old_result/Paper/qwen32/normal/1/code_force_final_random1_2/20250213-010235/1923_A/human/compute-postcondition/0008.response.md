The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used for iterating `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Since the loop runs `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t < 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, and the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1; `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.**
