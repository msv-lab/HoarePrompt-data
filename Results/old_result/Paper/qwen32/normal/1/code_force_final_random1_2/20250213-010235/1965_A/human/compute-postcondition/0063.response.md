Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `test` is `False`, `j` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `j % 2 == 1` or not, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `test` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `j` is also incremented by 1. We exit the most internal loop or if statement.
