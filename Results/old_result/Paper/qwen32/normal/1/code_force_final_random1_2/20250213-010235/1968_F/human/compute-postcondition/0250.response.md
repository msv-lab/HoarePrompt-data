Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a series of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines whether there exists a subarray within `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by a newline after each test case's results.**
