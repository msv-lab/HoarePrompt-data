The `break` statement will exit the current loop or conditional block without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`, `j`) will be modified.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `test` is `False`; `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`; `j` is either an odd number or an even number and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
