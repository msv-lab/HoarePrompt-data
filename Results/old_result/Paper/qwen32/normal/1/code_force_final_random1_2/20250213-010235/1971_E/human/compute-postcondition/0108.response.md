Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`.
- The element at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(m), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated using the formula: `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
   - We don't have explicit values for `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `ql`, and `s`, but we know how they are used in the formula.

2. **Value of `ql`:**
   - Initially, `ql` is some value.
   - It is then updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - Finally, it is stated that `a[s] = ql`, which means after the update, `ql` equals the element at index `s` in the list `a`.

3. **Printing `int(m)`:**
   - The `print` statement converts `m` to an integer using `int(m)` and prints it, followed by a space (`end=' '`).

### Final Output Description:
- Since we do not have specific values for `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `ql`, and `s`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`.
- However, we know that `m` is computed based on the given formula, and it will be converted to an integer before being printed.

Thus, the output will be the integer value of `m` as computed by the formula, followed by a space.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
