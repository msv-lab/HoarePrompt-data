Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, either `m` is not even or `n` is not even (or both). At least one of `m` or `n` is even.**
