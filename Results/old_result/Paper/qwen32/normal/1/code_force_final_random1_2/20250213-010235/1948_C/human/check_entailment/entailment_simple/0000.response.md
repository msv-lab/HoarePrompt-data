### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It performs two actions every second:
  1. Moves left, right, down, or up.
  2. Moves according to the arrow in the new cell.
- We need to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

#### Key Observations:
- Since the robot must end up at (2, n), it must eventually move from the first row to the second row and reach the last column.
- The robot can only move between rows when it reaches a column where the arrows in both rows point towards each other (one pointing down and the other pointing up).

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- The code iterates through every odd-indexed column (1-based index) and checks if the arrows in both rows point left ('<') in adjacent columns.
- If it finds such a configuration, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
- If it completes the loop without finding such a configuration, it prints "YES".

#### Flaws in the Code:
- The code does not actually simulate the robot's movement. Instead, it makes a specific assumption about the arrows in adjacent columns.
- The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).
- The code does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up or down based on the arrows and reaching the target position.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movements step-by-step, considering all possible moves and ensuring that the robot can indeed reach (2, n).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
