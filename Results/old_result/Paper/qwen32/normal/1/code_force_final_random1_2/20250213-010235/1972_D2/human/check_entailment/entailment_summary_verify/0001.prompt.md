You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then executes `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value explicitly, but the annotations suggest that the final state involves a calculation related to the sum of the first `t` natural numbers (`t * (t + 1) // 2`).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The program consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Let's break down each function:

#### Function `func_1()`

This function appears to be designed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop (`while x * x <= n`):**
   - This loop iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The reason for iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\) is not immediately clear, but it suggests some optimization related to the constraints.

3. **Inner Loop (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`):**
   - This loop iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - The condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` ensures that the sums and products remain within the bounds of `n` and `m`.

4. **Condition Check (`if math.gcd(x, y) == 1`):**
   - If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, it implies that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The code then attempts to increment `cnt` by the minimum of two values:
     - `n / ((x + y) * x)`
     - `m // ((x + y) * y)`

   However, there are a few issues here:
   - The use of floating-point division (`/`) for `n / ((x + y) * x)` might lead to incorrect results because it could result in a non-integer value.
   - The logic to count valid pairs seems flawed. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` alone does not guarantee that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The calculation of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly account for all valid pairs `(a, b)`.

#### Function `func_2()`

This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:
- Incorrect handling of the gcd condition.
- Incorrect counting mechanism for valid pairs.
- Potential issues with floating-point arithmetic.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.
