The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. Since `n` is given as the input integer and does not change during the loop iterations, we only need to adjust `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's say `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `x[i]` which is `a`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `y[i]` which is `b`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `r[i]` which is `c`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is `i + 1`**
