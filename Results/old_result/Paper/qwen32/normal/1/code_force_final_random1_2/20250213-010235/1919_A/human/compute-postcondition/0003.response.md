The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. The variables `t` (number of test cases) and `results` (an empty list) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list.**
