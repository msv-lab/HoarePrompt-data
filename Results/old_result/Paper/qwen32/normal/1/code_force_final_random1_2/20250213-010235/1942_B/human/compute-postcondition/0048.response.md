The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. Given that `mex` is initially `n` and `ar[i]` is an element from the list `ar`, the new value of `mex` will be `n - ar[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `res`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None`, and `mex` is `n - ar[i]`.**
