The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` and the result of `func_10()`. Since the underscore `_` does not represent any variable that needs to be adjusted, we focus on `func_10()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must have returned a value greater than 1 for the loop to have executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value that is still greater than the current iteration count.

Let's denote the return value of `func_10()` as `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was greater than 1, and the loop had already executed some number of times, say `k` times. Therefore, `x` must be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can only say that `func_10()` must return a value greater than the number of iterations that have already completed. However, we can assume that after the previous iteration, `func_10()` returned a value `x` such that the loop is set to execute again, meaning `x` is at least 2 (since it must be greater than 1).

For the next iteration, `func_10()` should return a value that is at least 3 (since `k + 1` would be 2 if `k` was 1, and we need `x > k + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `func_10()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count, which we can assume to be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **The return value of `func_14()` (converted to a string) followed by a newline character is written to the standard output. `func_10()` must return a value greater than 2.**
