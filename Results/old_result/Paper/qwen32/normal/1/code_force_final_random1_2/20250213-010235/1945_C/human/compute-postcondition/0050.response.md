The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `final`. This action does not affect the value of `mini`, which remains the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is an empty list.**
