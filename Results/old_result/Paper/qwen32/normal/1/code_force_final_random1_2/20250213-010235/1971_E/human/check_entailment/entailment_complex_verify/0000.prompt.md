You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

    #State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, all queries have been answered. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` reflect the current test case's data, while `l` is `-1` indicating no more queries are left in the current test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and a series of queries. For each query `d`, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between the lists `a` and `b`. Specifically, it determines a value `m` such that if `d` matches an element in `a`, `m` is the corresponding element in `b`; otherwise, `m` is interpolated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`. After processing all queries for a test case, it moves on to the next test case until all test cases are completed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze its logic and compare it against the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which represent the positions and times at those positions, respectively.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program constructs `ad` and `bd` which are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` for each segment between the points.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, the program finds the segment where `d` lies using `bisect_left`.
   - If `d` exactly matches one of the points in `a`, it directly returns the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the exact time taken to reach `d` within the segment by using the precomputed speeds.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `d` is exactly at one of the known points by returning the corresponding time.
   - It also correctly calculates the time for points `d` that lie between known points by using the precomputed speeds.

2. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that finding the segment for each query is efficient.
   - Precomputing the speeds and distances ensures that the time complexity for each query is low.

3. **Correctness of Calculations:**
   - The program correctly computes the time taken to travel from the start of a segment to the point `d` by using the formula `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, where `ql` is the remaining distance within the segment.

### Testing with Example Inputs

Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:

#### Example 1:
```
4
10 1 3
10
10
0
6
7
```
**Expected Output:** `0 6 7`

#### Example 2:
```
10 2 4
4 10
4 7
6
4
2
7
```
**Expected Output:** `5 4 2 5`

#### Example 3:
```
1000000000 1 1
1000000000
1000000000
99999999
```
**Expected Output:** `99999999`

#### Example 4:
```
6 1 3
6
5
2
6
5
```
**Expected Output:** `1 5 4`

The program produces the correct output for these examples, indicating that it handles the basic cases correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it with example inputs, I did not find any cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. The logic appears to be correct and handles both the edge cases and general scenarios appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem description accurately. It efficiently computes the required times for each query using precomputed speeds and segment information.
