### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code and its components to ensure that it correctly implements the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the dimensions of the field (N, M).
   - It then reads the grid and populates a dictionary `elements` with the positions of all non-empty cells.
   - It identifies players and their initial positions, storing them in `allPlayers`.
   - It also identifies the positions of the goals for both teams and stores them in `goal`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - For each command, the function checks the type of action (move, catch, throw).
   - Moves are handled by updating the position of the entity in the `elements` dictionary.
   - Catching the Quaffle updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to reflect that the player is now holding the Quaffle.
   - Throwing the Quaffle resets the player's possession in `allPlayers` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal area using the `goalIn` function.
     - If the Quaffle is in a goal area, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and a message indicating a goal is printed.
     - The Quaffle is then reset to the center of the field.

3. **Goal Checking:**
   - The function `goalIn` checks if a given position is within the goal areas of either team.
   - It returns 0 for the red team's goal, 1 for the blue team's goal, and -1 if the position is not in a goal area.

4. **Player Identification:**
   - The function `isPlayer` checks if a given string represents a player by ensuring the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

5. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the final scores of the red and blue teams.

### Analysis:
- The code correctly handles the initialization of the game state and processes each command as described in the problem statement.
- It correctly identifies when a goal is scored and updates the scores accordingly.
- It ensures that the Quaffle is reset to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
- The functions `goalIn` and `isPlayer` are correctly implemented and used within `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the problem description and handles all specified cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
