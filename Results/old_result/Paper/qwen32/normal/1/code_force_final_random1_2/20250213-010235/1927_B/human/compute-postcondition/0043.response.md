Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters such that the i-th character of `s` corresponds to the value at index `a[i-1]` in a cyclic permutation of the alphabet starting from 'a'.**
