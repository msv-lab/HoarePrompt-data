In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it does not retain its value between iterations, and the range is determined by the user input `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the integer input by the user
- `k` is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received
- `best` is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state and is not used within the loop body, the only thing that needs to be considered is the range of the loop, which is determined by `n`. The values of `t`, `k`, and `best` do not influence the continuation of the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of the loop control variables. However, the loop will continue as long as there are iterations left based on the value of `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, `k` is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, `best` is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received**
