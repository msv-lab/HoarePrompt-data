To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 2
- `a` is 4
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`
- `b` is `B[r - 1]`

The code snippet is:
```python
b = b - B[x]
```

We need to find the new value of `b` after this operation. To do this, we need to know the values of `b` and `B[x]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `b` is `B[r - 1]`
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`

However, the values of `r` and `l` are not provided in the initial state. Since `r` and `l` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. But we can express `b` in terms of `r` and `l`.

Let's assume `r` and `l` are such that `x` is a valid index for the list `B`. The valid indices for `B` are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

So, `B[x]` will be one of the elements in `B` depending on the value of `x`.

Since `b` is initially `B[r - 1]`, after the operation `b = b - B[x]`, `b` will be `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]; `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]; `n` is greater than 0; `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'; `i` is 2; `a` is 4; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`**

In natural language: The lists `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged. The lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The value of `n` remains greater than 0. The value of `s[i]` remains either '>' or not '>'. The value of `i` remains 2. The value of `a` remains 4. The value of `x` remains `r - (l + 2)`. The value of `b` is now `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.
