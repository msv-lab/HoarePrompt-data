You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies a list `a` by potentially replacing elements within a specified range `[l, r]` with a uniform value if a certain condition is met. It also records operations performed in a list `ops`. The final state of the program results in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` being transformed such that all its elements are equal to `r - l + 1` if the sum of the sublist is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. Otherwise, it recursively processes sublists around the maximum element in the current sublist.

    #State: `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2`, `ops` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a`. The function prints the first two return values of `func_2` (denoted as `s` and `m`) and subsequently prints pairs of indices (incremented by 1) from the third return value of `func_2` (denoted as `ops`).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Undefined Variable `a` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` references the variable `a`, but `a` is not defined within the scope of this function. It seems like `a` should be passed as a parameter to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Undefined Variable `ops` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: Similarly, the variable `ops` is used in `recursive_maximize_sum` but is not defined within its scope. It should also be passed as a parameter.

3. **Incorrect Function Calls**: The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the necessary arguments (`a` and `ops`). This will result in errors.

4. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to ensure that the subarray from index `l` to `r` is filled with the MEX value of the subarray. However, the current implementation incorrectly sets the values to `r - l + 1` instead of computing the MEX value.

5. **Incorrect Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` contains logic that is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a valid way to determine whether to replace the subarray with its MEX value.

6. **Incorrect Output Format**: The function `func_3` prints the operations with indices incremented by 1, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, since the underlying logic is flawed, the output will not necessarily be correct.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly compute the MEX value for each subarray and apply the operations accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    mex_value = 0
    while mex_value in subarray:
        mex_value += 1
    return mex_value

def maximize_sum(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    
    def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
        if l > r:
            return
        subarray = a[l:r+1]
        current_mex = mex(subarray)
        if current_mex != max(subarray):
            ops.append((l, r))
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                a[i] = current_mex
        else:
            mx = max(subarray)
            pos = a.index(mx, l, r + 1)
            if pos != l:
                recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
            if pos != r:
                recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
    
    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = maximize_sum(a)
    print(s, m)
    for l, r in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected version defines the MEX function, ensures that `a` and `ops` are properly passed to the recursive function, and correctly applies the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
