The given code snippet only includes the line `ans += ss`. However, there is no variable `ss` defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems likely that `ss` should be `s` (the non-empty string mentioned in the initial state). Assuming `ss` is indeed `s`, the code appends the string `s` to the string `ans`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state means that the variable `ans` now holds the value of the string `s`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
