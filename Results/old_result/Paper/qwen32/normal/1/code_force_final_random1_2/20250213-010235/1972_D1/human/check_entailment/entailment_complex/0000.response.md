### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and its functions to see if they collectively solve the problem described.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Functions**:
   - **func_10()**: Reads the number of test cases.
   - **func_7()**: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - **func_16()**: Iterates over the number of test cases, calls `func_15()` for each test case, and prints the result.
   - **func_15()**: This function is crucial as it calculates the number of valid pairs for each test case.

3. **Analysis of func_15()**:
   - **Input**: `n` and `m` are read using `func_7()`.
   - **Logic**: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i * i <= n + i`. For each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - **Output**: Returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` does not seem to directly address the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it calculates a sum involving `n` and `i` which does not match the problem requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_15()` does not compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement.
