To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
2. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop control variable and is automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

The other variables (`t`, `m`, `grid`, `tc`, `gr`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the given instructions.

So, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is an empty list.**
