### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array), `m` (modulus), the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the commands in the string `s` and computes the required remainders.
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to point to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It creates an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order specified by the commands in `s`.
   - It iterates through the commands in `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to `b` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to `b` and decrements `r`.

3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - After constructing the list `b`, the function calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will hold the cumulative product.
   - It iterates through the elements of `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product of the current element and `p`, modulo `m`, and appending this value to `ans`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns the list `ans` in reverse order.

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue lies in the way the product is calculated and stored in `ans`. The program calculates the cumulative product in reverse order and then reverses `ans` before returning it. However, the problem requires the remainders to be computed and printed in the order of the commands, not in the reverse order.
- Specifically, the product should be computed in the order specified by `s`, and the remainders should be stored and returned in the same order.

### Corrected Approach:
- Instead of reversing `ans` before returning it, the program should compute the product in the order specified by `s` and store the remainders directly in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it reverses the order of the remainders before returning them, which does not match the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
