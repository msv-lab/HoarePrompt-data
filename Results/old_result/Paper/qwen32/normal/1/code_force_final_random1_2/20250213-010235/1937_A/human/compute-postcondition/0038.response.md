Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
3. `i` is 1.
4. `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user.
5. `power` is equal to `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `n`:**
   - `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer input by the user. This means if the user inputs an integer `x`, then `n = log2(x)`.
   - For example, if the user inputs `x = 8`, then `n = log2(8) = 3`.

2. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `power` is defined as `n - 1`.
   - Continuing with the example where `n = 3`, `power` would be `3 - 1 = 2`.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The `print` statement outputs `2 ** power`.
   - Using the example where `power = 2`, the expression becomes `2 ** 2 = 4`.

### General Case:
- If the user inputs an integer `x`, then `n = log2(x)`.
- `power` is `n - 1`, so `power = log2(x) - 1`.
- The output of the print statement is `2 ** (log2(x) - 1)`.

### Simplifying the Expression:
- `2 ** (log2(x) - 1)` can be simplified using properties of exponents and logarithms.
- `2 ** (log2(x) - 1) = 2 ** log2(x) / 2 ** 1 = x / 2`.

### Final Output:
- The output of the print statement is `x / 2`, where `x` is the integer input by the user.

### Conclusion:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output of the print statement is half of the integer input by the user.

Output: **x / 2 (where x is the integer input by the user)**
