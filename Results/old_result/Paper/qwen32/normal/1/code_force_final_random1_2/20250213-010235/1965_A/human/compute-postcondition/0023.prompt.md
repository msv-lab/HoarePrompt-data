Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a sorted list of integers where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `A` is False; `not_c` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
        not_c = False
        break
    A = not A


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates. If the difference between the current element `set_[i]` and the previous element `set_[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `A` is True and `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `A` is True and `not_c` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is False; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` is True. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is True; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` remains unchanged; `set_` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
