Output State: **`cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now 0, `i` is the next element in `b_values` after the current one, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was `>= k` during the loop, `curr` is the count of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that are in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged, `b_values` must have at least one element.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cnt_b[i]` has been set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, including `i`, `ans`, `curr`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values`. The condition that `b_values` must have at least one element still holds.
