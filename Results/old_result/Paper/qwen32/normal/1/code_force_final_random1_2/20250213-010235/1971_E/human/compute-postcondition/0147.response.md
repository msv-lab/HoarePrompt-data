To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the variables `ad` and `bd`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of the list `a`, and in each iteration, it appends the difference between consecutive elements of `a` to the list `ad`. The variable `bd` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop body.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `len(a) - 1`. Therefore, the final state of `ad` will contain the differences between all consecutive elements of `a`.

Let's denote the length of `a` as `L`. After the loop completes, `ad` will be `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[L-1] - a[L-2]]`. Since `bd` is not modified within the loop, it will remain `[0]`.

The variables `l`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, `q`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`l` is `q-1`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `m` is the sum of all calculated `m` values from each iteration, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration, `s` is the index found in the last iteration, `q` is the newly input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is `[0]`**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `ad` will contain the differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`, starting with a `0` at the beginning. All other variables remain in their initial states or as described in the problem statement.
