Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_next`; `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`); `c` is `i_next // 2`; `sx` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by `c`, where `c` was previously calculated as `i_current // 2`. The other variables (`val`, `i`, `c`, and `sx`) remain unchanged except for `y`, which is now `y - c`. The variable `sx` is still described as being increased by `i`, but since there is no operation modifying `sx` in the given code snippet, this part of the description reflects its state before the decrement of `y`.
