Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is `'NO'`. If the first character of `gr[i]` is different from the first character of `gr[i + 1]` or the last character of `gr[i]` is different from the last character of `gr[i + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
