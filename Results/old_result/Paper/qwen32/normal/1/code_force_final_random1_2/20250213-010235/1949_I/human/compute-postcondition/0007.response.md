The code snippet assigns values to specific indices of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` based on the input. Given that `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, we'll assume `i` is a predefined index within the range of 0 to `n-1`.

Let's denote the input integers as `a`, `b`, and `c`. After executing the code, the values at index `i` of `x`, `y`, and `r` will be updated to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `x[i]` which is `a`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `y[i]` which is `b`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `r[i]` which is `c`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`**.

In natural language: The value at index `i` of list `x` is now `a`, the value at index `i` of list `y` is now `b`, and the value at index `i` of list `r` is now `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
