Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` must have a length greater than 2; `b` is a list of elements; `new[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`; `new2[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`; `new[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`; `new2[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`; `new[2]` is `min(a[2], b[2])`; `new2[2]` is `max(a[2], b[2])`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
