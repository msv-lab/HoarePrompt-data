The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 3, so now `y` is 4. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The conditions related to these variables still hold.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, and if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is at least 3. Otherwise, `cnt` remains at least 2.**
