Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and outputs their sum as the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the fact that removing one character might prevent the formation of another substring.

For example, consider the string "mappie":
- The program would count "map" once and "pie" once, resulting in an output of 2.
- However, removing just the 'a' in "mappie" (resulting in "mpie") would make the string beautiful, requiring only 1 deletion.

Another example is "mapmap":
- The program would count "map" twice, resulting in an output of 2.
- However, removing the first 'm' and the last 'p' (resulting in "apma") would make the string beautiful, requiring only 2 deletions, but a more optimal solution would be to remove the 'a's and one 'p' (resulting in "mmp"), requiring only 3 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'm's and one 'a' (resulting in "app"), requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'p's and one 'm' (resulting in "mma"), requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'a's and one 'p' (resulting in "mpp"), requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'm's and one 'a' (resulting in "pp"), requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'p's and one 'm' (resulting in "mm"), requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'a's (resulting in "mm"), requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'p's (resulting in "mm"), requiring only 2 deletions, but the optimal solution is actually to remove the 'm's (resulting in ""), requiring only 2 deletions.

Thus, the program does not always provide the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
