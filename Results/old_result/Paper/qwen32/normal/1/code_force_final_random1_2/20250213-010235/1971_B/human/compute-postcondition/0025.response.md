Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order. If `b` equals `s`, the condition holds as specified; otherwise, the condition does not affect the values of the variables.**
