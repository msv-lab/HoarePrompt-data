The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5. The value of `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 5; `i` is 5.**
