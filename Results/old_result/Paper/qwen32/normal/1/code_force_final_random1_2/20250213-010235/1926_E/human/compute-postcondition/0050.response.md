The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `L` initially contains two elements both equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, after appending `m` to `L`, `L` will now contain three elements, all of which are `(n + 1) // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pow`, and `tot`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 9, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`, `pow` is 16, `tot` is 8, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
