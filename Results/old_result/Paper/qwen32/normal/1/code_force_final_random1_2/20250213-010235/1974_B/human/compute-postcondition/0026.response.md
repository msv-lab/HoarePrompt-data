Output State: **The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique lowercase Latin characters found in the list `s`, potentially in an unsorted order.**

This output state describes the result of joining all unique characters stored in the `unique_chars` list into a single string. The order of characters in the resulting string corresponds to their order in the `unique_chars` list, which may not necessarily be sorted.
