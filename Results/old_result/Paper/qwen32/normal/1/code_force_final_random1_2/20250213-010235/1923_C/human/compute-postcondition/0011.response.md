The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `p` initially contains a single element `0`, after the append operation, `p` will contain two elements: the initial `0` and the value of `i`.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
- `p` now contains two elements: `[0, i]`.
- `c` remains a list containing a single element `0`.
- `i` remains `x`.
- `j` remains 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`]; `c` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 0.**
