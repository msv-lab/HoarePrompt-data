The code snippet provided is:

```python
cons = x + sx - 2
```

This line calculates the value of `cons` based on the existing values of `x` and `sx`. No other variables are modified in this snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `val` remains sorted with all even numbers before odd numbers.
- `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus the original count of `1`s in `val`.
- `i` is the last element of `val`.
- `y` is reduced by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements in `val`.

The only variable being updated here is `cons`. The value of `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`val` remains sorted with all even numbers before odd numbers; `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus the original count of `1`s in `val`; `i` is the last element of `val`; `y` is reduced by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements in `val`; `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.**
