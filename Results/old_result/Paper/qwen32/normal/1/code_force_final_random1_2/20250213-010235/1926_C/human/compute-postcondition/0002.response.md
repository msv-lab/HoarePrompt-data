The value of `a` is updated to be the sum of its current value (which is 0) and the last digit of `num`. Since `a` was initially 0, `a` now equals the last digit of `num`. The value of `num` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the last digit of `num`.**
