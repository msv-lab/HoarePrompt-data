To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`u2vs`**: A list of `n` lists. This list is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this analysis.
2. **`d`**: A list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes. This list is used to compute `a` and `b`.
3. **`a`**: The result of `func_1(d)`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we can assume it returns some value derived from `d`. However, `a` is not used in the print statement.
4. **`previous`**: A list of predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to each node. This list is used to construct `path_ba`.
5. **`b`**: The result of `func_1(d)`. Similar to `a`, `b` is also the result of `func_1(d)`. It represents a specific node in the shortest path tree.
6. **`path_ba`**: A list containing `b` and its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b`. This list is constructed using the `previous` list.
7. **`ops`**: A list of tuples derived from `path_ba`. The construction of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`.

### Construction of `path_ba` and `ops`:
- **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
  - `ops` includes tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` and `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`.
- **If the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 3**:
  - `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from `1` to `2k-3`, where `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement uses `map` with a lambda function to format each tuple in `ops` and then prints them line by line. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` as `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`. This means that the first element of each tuple is incremented by 1, and both elements are separated by a space.

### Output Description:
The output will be a series of lines, each representing a tuple from `ops` with the first element incremented by 1 and both elements separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the lack of explicit values for `d`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba`, we can describe the output in terms of the structure of `ops`.

Output: **Each line is a formatted string of the form 'node+1 index', where 'node+1' is the incremented value of the node from the middle of `path_ba` (or the pair of middle nodes if `path_ba` is even) and 'index' is the corresponding index in the path.**
