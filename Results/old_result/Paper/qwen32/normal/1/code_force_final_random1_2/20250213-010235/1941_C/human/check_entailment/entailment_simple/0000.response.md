### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each input string `s` and then printing the sum of these counts as the result. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the fact that removing one character might prevent another occurrence of "map" or "pie".

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, by removing only 1 character (the second 'p'), both "map" and "pie" can be eliminated, making the string beautiful with a minimum of 1 deletion.

The correct approach should involve checking for the presence of "map" and "pie" and finding a way to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of these substrings. This could involve more complex algorithms, such as dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is made.

Given the current implementation, it fails to provide the correct solution for all possible cases due to the reasons mentioned above.
