Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 2
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = B[r]
```

From the code snippet, we see that `b` is being assigned the value from list `B` at index `r`. Since `r` is decreased by 1, we need to know the value of `r` before it was decreased to determine its current value. However, since the exact value of `r` before the decrement is not specified, we can only express `b` in terms of `r`.

Since `r` is decreased by 1, the current value of `r` is `r - 1`. Therefore, `b` will be assigned the value of `B[r - 1]`.

Let's assume `r` was initially 3 (since `r` is decreased by 1, and `B` has 4 elements, `r` could reasonably be 3). Then `r` would now be 2, and `b` would be `B[2]`, which is `3`.

However, without knowing the exact initial value of `r`, we can only say that `b` is `B[r - 1]`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`**.
