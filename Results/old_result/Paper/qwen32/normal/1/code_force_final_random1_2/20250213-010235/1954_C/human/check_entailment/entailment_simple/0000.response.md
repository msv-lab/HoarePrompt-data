### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to see if it correctly maximizes the product of `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, converts them into lists of digits (`a` and `b`), and initializes two empty lists `new` and `new2` of the same length to store the resulting digits.

2. **Processing Each Digit Pair**:
   - It iterates through each pair of corresponding digits in `a` and `b` until it finds a pair where the digits are different.
   - For the first differing pair, it assigns the maximum digit to `new` and the minimum digit to `new2`.
   - After processing the first differing pair, it continues iterating through the remaining digits.
   - For the remaining digits, it assigns the minimum digit to `new` and the maximum digit to `new2`.

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the numbers formed by the digits in `new` and `new2`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Objective**: The goal is to maximize the product of the two numbers by swapping corresponding digits.
- **Strategy**: The strategy implemented in the code is to make sure that the larger digits are placed in the higher significant positions of the two numbers. This is done by:
  - Keeping the digits in the same position as long as they are equal.
  - When a pair of differing digits is found, the larger digit is placed in the first number and the smaller digit in the second number.
  - For all subsequent digits, the smaller digit is placed in the first number and the larger digit in the second number. This ensures that the larger digits are concentrated in the higher significant positions of one of the numbers.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: `x = 73`, `y = 31`
- Processed Digits:
  - First pair: `7` and `3` → `new = [7]`, `new2 = [3]`
  - Second pair: `3` and `1` → `new = [7, 1]`, `new2 = [3, 3]`
- Output: `71`, `33`

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: `x = 2`, `y = 5`
- Processed Digits:
  - First pair: `2` and `5` → `new = [5]`, `new2 = [2]`
- Output: `5`, `2`

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: `x = 3516`, `y = 3982`
- Processed Digits:
  - First pair: `3` and `3` → `new = [3]`, `new2 = [3]`
  - Second pair: `5` and `9` → `new = [3, 9]`, `new2 = [3, 5]`
  - Third pair: `1` and `8` → `new = [3, 9, 1]`, `new2 = [3, 5, 8]`
  - Fourth pair: `6` and `2` → `new = [3, 9, 1, 6]`, `new2 = [3, 5, 8, 2]`
- Output: `3912`, `3586`

The outputs match the expected results, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits.

**Correctness: True**
