The function takes a positive integer `n`, three positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that their sum equals `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list in descending order and attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. If the condition specified by `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is met, it returns a tuple containing 'YES' and the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
