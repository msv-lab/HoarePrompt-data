The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `r`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is an empty list.**
