You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and an integer `y`. It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions, which is the minimum of a computed result and `n - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular `n`-sided polygon, where `x` vertices have already been chosen by Bessie.

### Key Points
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We need to form triangles using the chosen vertices and potentially adding up to `y` more vertices.
2. **Non-intersecting Triangles**: The triangles should not intersect, meaning that the diagonals drawn should not cross each other.
3. **Maximizing Triangles**: The strategy involves maximizing the number of triangles that can be formed under these constraints.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It also reads the list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and sorts them.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial number of triangles is calculated as `ans = x + y - 2`. This seems to be an attempt to account for the fact that each new vertex can potentially form additional triangles.

3. **Handling Adjacent Vertices**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices to check gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap between two vertices is exactly 2, it adds one more triangle (`ans += 1`).
   - If the gap is even and there are enough additional vertices (`y`) to fill the gap, it calculates how many triangles can be formed and adjusts `y` accordingly.

4. **Handling Wrap-around**:
   - The program checks the gap between the last and the first vertex (considering the wrap-around in the polygon).
   - Similar to the previous step, it checks if the gap can be filled with additional vertices to form more triangles.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program adds any remaining `y` vertices to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` (since the maximum number of triangles in an `n`-sided polygon is `n - 2`).

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles**:
   - The formula `ans = x + y - 2` is not necessarily correct. The number of triangles that can be formed depends on how the vertices are arranged and connected, not just the count of vertices.
   
2. **Handling Gaps**:
   - The logic for handling gaps between vertices is flawed. Simply checking if the gap is 2 or even and adjusting `y` does not guarantee the formation of non-intersecting triangles.
   
3. **Wrap-around Handling**:
   - The wrap-around logic is similar to the gap handling and suffers from the same issues.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Adding remaining `y` vertices directly to `ans` without considering their impact on forming triangles is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The approach of simply counting vertices and gaps does not ensure the formation of non-intersecting triangles, and the final adjustment is not valid.

**Correctness: False**
