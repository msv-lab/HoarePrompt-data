Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `n` is the newly input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding `nums`:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers.
   - `nums[:-1]` represents all elements of `nums` except the last one.
   - `nums[-1]` represents the last element of `nums`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `max(nums[:-1])`: This finds the maximum value among all elements of `nums` except the last one.
   - `nums[-1]`: This is the last element of `nums`.
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value of the first `n-1` elements of `nums` to the last element of `nums`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements of the list `nums` and the last element of `nums`.

Given the lack of specific values for `nums`, we cannot compute the exact numerical output. However, we can precisely describe the computation being performed.

### Final Output:
Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1] (where max(nums[:-1]) is the maximum value of the first n-1 elements of nums and nums[-1] is the last element of nums)**
