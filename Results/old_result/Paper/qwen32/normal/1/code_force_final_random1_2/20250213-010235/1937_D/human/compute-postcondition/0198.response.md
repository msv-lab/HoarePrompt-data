To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet with respect to the initial state provided.

The code snippet is:
```python
b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
```

Given Initial State:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 2
- `r` is `r_initial - 1`
- `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`
- `b` is `1` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains `4`

Let's break down the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`:

- `i` is 2
- `idx_A[l - 1]`: This depends on the value of `l`. Since `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can express the new value of `b` in terms of `l`.
- `r` is `r_initial - 1`
- `r + 1` is `r_initial`

So, the expression becomes:
\[ b = b + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial \]

Since `b` was initially `1` if `l - r - 1 > 0` or `4` otherwise, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `b` was `1`:
   \[ b = 1 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial \]

2. If `b` was `4`:
   \[ b = 4 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial \]

Thus, the output state will depend on the value of `b` before the operation and the value of `l`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`; `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`; `n` is greater than 0; `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`; `i` is 2; `r` is `r_initial - 1`; `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`; `b` is `1 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `1` or `4 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `4`.**
