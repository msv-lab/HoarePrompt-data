### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to ensure that we can defeat all monsters before they reach position 0.
- Each second, we can shoot up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1.
- After shooting, any monster with health 0 or less dies.
- All surviving monsters move one step towards position 0.

#### Key Points:
1. **Order of Shooting**: The strategy involves shooting monsters in such a way that no two monsters are at the same distance from position 0 when they are defeated.
2. **Distance Tracking**: The function `func_1` sorts the indices of monsters based on their absolute distance from position 0. This ensures that we consider the closest monsters first.
3. **Bullet Allocation**: For each distance, we allocate bullets to reduce the health of monsters until either we run out of bullets or all monsters at that distance are defeated.
4. **Early Termination**: If a monster reaches position 0 (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that we cannot survive.

#### Function Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Sorts the indices of monsters based on their absolute distance from position 0.
  - Iterates through these sorted indices, allocating up to `k` bullets per second to reduce the health of monsters.
  - Checks if any monster reaches position 0 during the process. If so, it returns `False`.
  - Returns `True` if all monsters are defeated without any reaching position 0.
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n`, the maximum number of bullets `k`, the list of health values `a`, and the list of positions `x`.
  - Calls `func_1` to determine if it's possible to defeat all monsters and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

#### Evaluation:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the order of shooting and ensures that no two monsters are at the same distance when they are defeated.
- The function also correctly checks for the condition where a monster reaches position 0, ensuring that we cannot survive.
- The overall structure of `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the appropriate results.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
