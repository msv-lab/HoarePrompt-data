Given the initial state, let's analyze the conditions and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the new input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- There is a specific condition involving the first and second elements of `b`, as well as the last and second-to-last elements of `b`.

### Condition Details:
- If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the condition in the if part holds.
- Otherwise, either the first element of `b` is even, or it is odd and the second element is equal to the first element plus 2.
- Additionally, either the last element of `b` is even, or it is odd and the second-to-last element is equal to the last element plus 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) or their values. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or the contents of `b`, the output will always be `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output `'YES'` irrespective of the input values or conditions specified.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
