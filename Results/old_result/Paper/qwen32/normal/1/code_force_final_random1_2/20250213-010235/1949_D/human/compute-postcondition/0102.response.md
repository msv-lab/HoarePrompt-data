Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; if `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` is a list containing the single element `i`, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list; `sb` is a list containing the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains an empty list. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `sb` includes `i` as its last element; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
