Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence, `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters plus `tmp`, and `tmp` is either an empty string or the character `'a' + i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` within the range `[0, k-1]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the value of `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
