Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]` and then by `a_values[0]`, and `y` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
