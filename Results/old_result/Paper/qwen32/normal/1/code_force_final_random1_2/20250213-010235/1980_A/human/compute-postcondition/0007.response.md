The only variable in the loop head is `prob`, which iterates over the string `a`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `prob`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `prob` was the current character being processed in the string `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `prob` should be the next character in the string `a`.

Let's denote the current position of `prob` in the string `a` as `k`. After the previous iteration, `prob` was `a[k]`. For the next iteration, `prob` should be `a[k+1]`.

Given that `a` is a string of length `n`, the loop will continue as long as `k < n-1`. 

So, if `prob` was `a[k]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `prob` should be `a[k+1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can describe the state in terms of the next character in the string `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where one element has been incremented by 1 compared to its initial state, `prob` is the next character in the string `a`**.

To be more precise, if `prob` was `a[k]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `prob` is `a[k+1]` (assuming `k+1 < n`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where one element has been incremented by 1 compared to its initial state, `prob` is the next character in the string `a`**.

Since we cannot determine the exact next character without knowing the current position, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where one element has been incremented by 1 compared to its initial state, `prob` is the next character in the string `a`**.
