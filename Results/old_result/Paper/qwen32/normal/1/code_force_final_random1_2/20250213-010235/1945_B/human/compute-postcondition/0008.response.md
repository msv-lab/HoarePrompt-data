Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1. Otherwise, it is not the case that `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, or either `a` or `b` is equal to 1.**
