The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `final` will contain one element, which is `elem`. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem`; `lst` has at least one element; the current value of `elem` satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
