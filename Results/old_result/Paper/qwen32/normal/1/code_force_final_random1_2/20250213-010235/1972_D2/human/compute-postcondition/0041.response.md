To determine the new state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact on the variables:

Given:
- `n` must be at least 12
- `m` must be at least 4
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

Code snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, compute the expressions inside the `min` function:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12
   \]

2. Calculate `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   n / 12
   \]
   Since `n` is at least 12, the minimum value of `n / 12` is 1.

3. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4
   \]

4. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   m // 4
   \]
   Since `m` is at least 4, the minimum value of `m // 4` is 1.

Thus, both expressions inside the `min` function evaluate to at least 1. Therefore, the `min` function will return at least 1.

Finally, `cnt` is incremented by the result of the `min` function. Since the minimum value is 1, `cnt` will increase by 1.

The output state will be:
- `n` remains at least 12
- `m` remains at least 4
- `x` remains 3
- `y` remains 1
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` remains 1
- `cnt` is incremented by 1

Output State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1**.
