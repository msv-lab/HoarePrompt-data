To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `power < n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user.
- `power` is 1.

The loop condition is `while power < n:`. For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `n`.

Since `power` is initialized to 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- `power` is already set to 1, so no change is needed for `power`.
- `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user, the integer input by the user must be greater than 2 (because log2(2) = 1).

Therefore, the integer input by the user must be greater than 2 to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer input by the user where the integer is greater than 2, `power` is 1**.
