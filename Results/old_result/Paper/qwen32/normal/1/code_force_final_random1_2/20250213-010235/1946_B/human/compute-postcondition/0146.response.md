The given code modifies the value of `sm` using the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`. Let's break down the changes:

1. `sm` is initially defined as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n`.
2. The new value of `sm` is calculated as `2 ** k * sm - sm`.

Given that `k` is `int(b[1])`, the new value of `sm` can be simplified as follows:
\[ \text{new\_sm} = 2^k \cdot \text{sm} - \text{sm} = (2^k - 1) \cdot \text{sm} \]

Therefore, the updated value of `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`, `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`, `j` is `j + n`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `n`.**
