To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `i < len(a)`
2. `a[i] == b[i]`

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is a list of integers converted from the input string.
- `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.
- `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.

Let's break down the requirements:
1. For `i < len(a)` to be true, `len(a)` must be greater than 0 (since `i` is 0).
2. For `a[i] == b[i]` to be true, the elements at index `i` (which is 0) in both lists `a` and `b` must be equal.

Thus, we need to ensure:
- `a` and `b` are non-empty lists.
- The first elements of `a` and `b` are equal.

Since `a` and `b` are derived from input strings, we can assume they are non-empty and control their contents to meet the condition.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 0, `b` is a non-empty list of integers where `b[0]` equals `a[0]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`**.

This ensures that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed.
