The code snippet provided is `ans += ss`. This line appends the string `ss` to the existing string `ans`.

Given the initial state, `ans` could be either an empty string or a string `ss` depending on whether `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous operations.

After executing `ans += ss`, the new value of `ans` will be the concatenation of its previous value and `ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` was 0, then the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1, making `cur` equal to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` after this operation, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string; `cnt` is incremented by 1; `cur` is 0; `ans` is the concatenation of its previous value and `ss`.**
