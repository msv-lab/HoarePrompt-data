Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, and `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 4` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, the second-to-last element is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4 - n]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 3 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 8 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 5` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, the second-to-last element is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`, and the third-to-last element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise it is omitted. The last element of `results` is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 6 - n]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 5 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 10 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 5` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, the second-to-last element is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`. The third-to-last element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise it is omitted. The last element of `results` is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, the last element of `results` is `'YES'`. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is `'NO'` and an additional `'NO'` is appended to `results`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 6 - n]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 5 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
