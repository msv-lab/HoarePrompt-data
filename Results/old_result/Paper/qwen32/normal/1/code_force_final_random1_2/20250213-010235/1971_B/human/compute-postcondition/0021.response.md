The given code snippet assigns the variable `b` the value of the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged unless `s` is modified later in the code, which is not the case here.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` remains the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `b` is now the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order.
- `c` is still undefined unless defined later in the code.
- The condition regarding the length of `a` and sorting of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order.**
