Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. For each iteration, the program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, computes a sorted list of unique integers `lis`, and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions. After all iterations, `i` equals `t`, and no further iterations will occur.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases provided initially. For each test case, the program reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers. It then creates a sorted list of unique integers from this list. Based on whether the number 1 is present in this list and the differences between consecutive elements, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. After processing all test cases, the loop variable `i` will have reached the value `t`, and the loop will terminate without any further iterations.
