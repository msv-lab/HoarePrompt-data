To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 6
- `m` must be at least 3
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `gcd(x, y) == 1`
- `cnt` is the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` up to the original `y`, plus 1 since the current pair `(2, 1)` satisfies `gcd(2, 1) == 1`.

First, let's calculate the two parts of the `min` function:

1. `n / ((x + y) * x)`
   - `x + y` is `2 + 1` which equals `3`
   - `(x + y) * x` is `3 * 2` which equals `6`
   - `n / 6`: Since `n` is at least 6, the minimum value of `n / 6` is `1` (if `n` is exactly 6). For `n > 6`, the value of `n / 6` will be greater than `1`.

2. `m // ((x + y) * y)`
   - `x + y` is `2 + 1` which equals `3`
   - `(x + y) * y` is `3 * 1` which equals `3`
   - `m // 3`: Since `m` is at least 3, the minimum value of `m // 3` is `1` (if `m` is exactly 3). For `m > 3`, the value of `m // 3` will be greater than `1`.

Since both expressions are at least `1` when `n` is at least `6` and `m` is at least `3`, the `min` function will return `1` in the simplest case.

Thus, `cnt` will be incremented by `1`.

The updated value of `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus `1`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus 1.**
