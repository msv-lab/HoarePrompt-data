The code snippet counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' within the string `s`. This affects the variable `x`, which is assigned the count of 'map' in `s`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the integer value read from the user input, `s` is the string value read from the user input, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.**
