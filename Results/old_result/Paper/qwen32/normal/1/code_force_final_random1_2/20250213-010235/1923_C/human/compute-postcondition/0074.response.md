The given code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 only if `x` equals 1, the exact value of `j` is not specified without knowing the history of `x`. However, we know that `c` initially contains three elements `[0, j, j]`, and after the append operation, `c` will have four elements `[0, j, j, j]` if `j` was not incremented, or `[0, j, j, j+1]` if `j` was incremented.

Given the information, the updated state of `c` is the key change. All other variables remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is `[0, i, 2 * x, 3 * x]`; `c` is `[0, j, j, j]` or `[0, j, j, j+1]` depending on whether `j` was incremented; `i` is `x + x + x`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
