The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (or some value less than `m`), and `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

So, `i` should be updated to `1` (or `i + 1` if `i` was not initially `0`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 1; `curr` is 1 if `a[1]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains 0.**
