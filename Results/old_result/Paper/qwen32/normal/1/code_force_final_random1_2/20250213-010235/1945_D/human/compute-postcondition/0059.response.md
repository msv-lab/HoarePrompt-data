Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` must be greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 (must be at least 0), `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The value of `best` is updated to be equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
