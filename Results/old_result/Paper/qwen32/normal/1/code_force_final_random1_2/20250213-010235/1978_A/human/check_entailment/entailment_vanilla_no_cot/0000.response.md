Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program always takes the last book and adds it to the maximum of the rest of the books, which does not guarantee the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two non-empty piles and then find the maximum sum of the largest book in each pile. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        # The optimal strategy is to take the two largest books
        print(nums[-1] + nums[-2])

func()
```

This program sorts the list of books by the number of pages and then simply adds the two largest books together, which is the optimal solution because these are the two books with the highest number of pages that Alice can read.
