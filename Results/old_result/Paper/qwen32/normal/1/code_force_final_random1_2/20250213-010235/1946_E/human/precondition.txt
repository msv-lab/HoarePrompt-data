a is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of the permutation (n), the number of prefix maximums (m1), and the number of suffix maximums (m2) for each test case. b is a list of lists where each sublist contains m1 integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order. The next sublist in b contains m2 integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The first element of a is the number of test cases (t). It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
