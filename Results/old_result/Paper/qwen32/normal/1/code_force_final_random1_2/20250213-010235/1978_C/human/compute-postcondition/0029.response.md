To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it terminates.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `n` down to `-1` with a step of `-2`. This means `i` takes on values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 1` if `n` is odd or `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` if `n` is even.
- For each iteration:
  - `c` is incremented by 1.
  - If `k` becomes `0`, the function returns the current list `l`.
  - If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the function calls `func_2(c, k, l)` and returns its result.
  - Otherwise, `k` is decremented by `i - 1` and `l` is updated by calling `func_3(c, l)`.

### Conditions for Termination:
- The loop terminates when `k` becomes `0` or when `k` is less than `i - 1` for some `i`.

### Final Output State:
Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `k` is updated to `k - i + 1` where `i` was initially `n`.
- After the second iteration, `k` is updated to `k - (i - 2) + 1` where `i` was `n-2`.
- After the third iteration, `k` is updated to `k - (i - 4) + 1` where `i` was `n-4`.

The loop continues until one of the termination conditions is met. Since the problem does not specify the exact behavior of `func_2` and `func_3`, we assume that the loop continues until `k` is reduced to `0` or `k` becomes less than `i - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will depend on how many iterations it takes for `k` to become `0` or less than `i - 1`. However, based on the given information and typical behavior of such loops, we can infer that the loop will terminate when `k` is sufficiently reduced.

Given the pattern observed, the final state will be:
- `c` will be the total number of iterations completed.
- `l` will be the list after being modified by `func_3` for each iteration.
- `k` will be `0` or less than `i - 1` for the last iteration.

Since the exact modifications by `func_2` and `func_3` are not specified, we can't determine the exact final list `l`. However, we know the value of `c` and the condition that caused the loop to terminate.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`c` is the total number of iterations completed, `k` is `0` or less than `i - 1` for the last iteration, and `l` is the list after being modified by `func_3` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs until `k` is reduced to `0` or becomes less than `i - 1`, and the final list `l` is the result of applying `func_3` for each iteration. The counter `c` keeps track of how many iterations were performed.
