The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects the value of `n` but does not change the values of `t`, `ar`, `res`, or `mex`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `n`, which now holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the corresponding iteration, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations.**
