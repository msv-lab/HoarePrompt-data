You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that t = 0, a is the last integer value read from the user input, s is the last string value read from the user input, x is the number of times 'map' appears in the last s, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last s.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the user input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and then printing the sum of these counts as the result. However, this approach is incorrect because simply counting the occurrences of these substrings does not give the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here's why the current program is incorrect:

1. **Overlapping Substrings**: The `count()` method counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring. For example, in the string "mapmap", the count of "map" would be 2, but removing one 'm' would suffice to make the string beautiful, which is not reflected by the simple count.

2. **Minimum Deletions**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions needed to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the final string. The current program does not address this requirement; it only provides the total count of these substrings without considering how they overlap or interact with each other.

3. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**: To correctly solve this problem, one might need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to determine the minimum deletions required. This involves checking each character and deciding whether it should be part of an unwanted substring ("map" or "pie") and making optimal decisions to minimize deletions.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
