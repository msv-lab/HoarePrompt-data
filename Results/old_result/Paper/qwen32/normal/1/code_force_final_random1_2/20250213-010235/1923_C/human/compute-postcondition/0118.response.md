The code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. The value of `j` is determined based on the condition: `j` is 2 if both `x` and `x_next` are 1, otherwise `j` is 1. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `c` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next, i]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `x_next + x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is 1 and `x_next` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1.**
