The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and represents the input value. After executing the code, `a` and `b` will hold the two integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, and `b` is the second integer read from the input.**
