Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`
- `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`
- `sm` is `2 + suf[n]` and the current value of `sm` is less than 0

Code Snippet:
```python
a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Impact of the code:
- `a` is assigned the value of `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Since `sm` is less than 0, `abs(sm)` will be `-sm`.
- The division `//` is integer division, which means it will divide `-sm` by `10 ** 9 + 7` and take the floor of the result.

Output State:
- `suf` remains `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`
- `smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`
- `sm` remains `2 + suf[n]` and is still less than 0
- `a` is calculated as `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `-sm // (10 ** 9 + 7)`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is `2 + suf[n]` and is less than 0; `a` is `-sm // (10 ** 9 + 7)`**
