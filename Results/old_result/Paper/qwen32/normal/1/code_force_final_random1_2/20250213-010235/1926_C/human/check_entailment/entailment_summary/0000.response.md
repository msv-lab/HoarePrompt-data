### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function and adds this value to `sum`.
   - The cumulative `sum` is appended to the list `A`.

2. **Handling Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does so by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to a running total `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` (using integer division `num = int(num / 10)`).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Precomputation:**
  - The program correctly computes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200,000.
  - This means that `A[n-1]` will indeed contain the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `n`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Precomputing the sums up to 200,000 ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases).
  - The precomputation step itself is efficient enough given the constraints, as it processes each of the 200,000 numbers once.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
  - It handles the digit extraction and summation properly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem by precomputing the necessary values and efficiently handling each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
