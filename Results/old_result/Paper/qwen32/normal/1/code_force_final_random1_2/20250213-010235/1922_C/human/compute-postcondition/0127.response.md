Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[m + 3]` is `1 + d1[m + 2]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.**
