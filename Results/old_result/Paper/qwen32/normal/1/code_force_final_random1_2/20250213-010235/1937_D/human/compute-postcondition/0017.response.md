The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (4 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` before appending.

After appending `x` to `A`, the length of `A` increases by 1, which affects the calculation of `x` in subsequent operations if this code is part of a larger loop or function. However, since no further operations are specified here, we only reflect the immediate change.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 4; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (4 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`; `A` now includes `x` as its last element.**
