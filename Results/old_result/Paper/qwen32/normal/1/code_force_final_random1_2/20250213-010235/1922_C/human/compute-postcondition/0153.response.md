To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they affect the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n`: An integer where \(n \geq 2\).
- `i`: Initialized to 0.
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. It is updated based on the differences in the list `l`.
- `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, except `d2[n - 1]` which is initialized to 1. Other values are calculated according to some loop logic.
- `m`: An integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `j`: Initialized to 0.
- `x` and `y`: The last pair of integers read from the input, with `y > x`.

### Key Focus:

We need to understand how `d1` is populated and how it affects the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`.

#### How `d1` is Populated:

Given that `d1` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, it means any key that hasn't been explicitly set will return 0 when accessed. The specific updates to `d1` depend on the differences in the list `l`. However, the exact mechanism of updating `d1` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only infer the general behavior based on the given information.

#### Calculation of `d1[y] - d1[x]`:

- `d1[y]`: This represents the count or accumulated value associated with the difference `y` in the list `l`.
- `d1[x]`: This represents the count or accumulated value associated with the difference `x` in the list `l`.

Since the exact values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` depend on the contents of `l` and the specific logic used to update `d1`, we cannot provide a numerical value without more details. However, we can describe the output in terms of these values.

### Conclusion:

The output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement will be the difference between the counts or accumulated values associated with the differences `y` and `x` in the list `l`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the accumulated value for difference y and d1[x] is the accumulated value for difference x in the list l)**
