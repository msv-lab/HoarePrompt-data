Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). The function processes these inputs but the specific processing is not detailed here. Based on the inputs, the function returns some output for each test case, though the exact nature of the output is not specified in the given information.**
