The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`.

Given the initial state, `nx` was initially an empty string `''`. After executing the code, `nx` will now include the character `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` remains unchanged, `sb` includes all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0` or both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is `'' + xx[i][j - 1]`.**
