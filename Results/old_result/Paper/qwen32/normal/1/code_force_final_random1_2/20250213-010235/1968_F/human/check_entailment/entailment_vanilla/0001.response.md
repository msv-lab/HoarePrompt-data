### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
   - The solution involves precomputing prefix XOR values for the array and using these to efficiently answer multiple queries.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - **Prefix XOR Calculation:** 
     - `pf[i]` stores the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
     - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray `[l, r]` as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

   - **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
     - `mp` is a dictionary where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where these XOR values occur.
     - This helps in quickly finding indices where a particular prefix XOR value appears.

   - **Query Handling:**
     - For each query `[l, r]`, we calculate the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]` as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
     - If `x` is `0`, the subarray can trivially be divided into any number of parts with XOR `0`.
     - Otherwise, we check if there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the prefix XOR at `i` is equal to `pf[r]`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the list of indices stored in `mp`.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach correctly computes the prefix XOR values and uses them to determine if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR.
   - The use of binary search ensures that the query handling is efficient.
   - The solution handles all edge cases, including when the XOR of the entire subarray is `0`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output for each query.

**Correctness: True**
