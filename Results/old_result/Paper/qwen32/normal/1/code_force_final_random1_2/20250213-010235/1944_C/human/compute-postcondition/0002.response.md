The given code snippet initializes a new empty set named `vis`. This does not affect the existing variables `arr`, `nums`, or `start`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**
