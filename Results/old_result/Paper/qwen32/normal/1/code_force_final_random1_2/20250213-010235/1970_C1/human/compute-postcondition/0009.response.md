The code snippet provided appends the integer `b` to the list stored in `lst[a]`. This means that the list associated with key `a` in the `defaultdict` `lst` will now include the integer `b`.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the `lst` dictionary. The values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `rev`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `rev[b]` now includes `a`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
