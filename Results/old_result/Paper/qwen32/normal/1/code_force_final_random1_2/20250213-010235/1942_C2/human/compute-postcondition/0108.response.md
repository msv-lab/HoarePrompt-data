The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers and does not change within the loop, we only need to adjust the variable `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `y` and `tmp` are unchanged.**
