The code snippet adds the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) to the `total`. Therefore, `total` will now be the sum of its previous value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (which ensures `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best` is 10; `v` is greater than `pos_final`; the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
