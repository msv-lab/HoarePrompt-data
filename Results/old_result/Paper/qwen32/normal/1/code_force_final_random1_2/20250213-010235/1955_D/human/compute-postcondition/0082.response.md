Output State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element after the current `i`; `i` is the next value in `b_values`; `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to `0`. Since the initial state already specifies that `cnt_b[i]` is `0`, this assignment does not change the value of `cnt_b[i]`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
