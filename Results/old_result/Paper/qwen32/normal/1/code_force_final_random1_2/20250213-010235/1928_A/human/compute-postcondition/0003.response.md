In this task, the initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the provided Python code snippet. The code snippet only contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`.

Let's break down the given information:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer read from the input and is even.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input and is even.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) are referenced in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
