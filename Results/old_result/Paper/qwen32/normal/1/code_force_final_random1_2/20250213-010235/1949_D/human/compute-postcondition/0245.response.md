The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will be "S". All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `nx` is "S"; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'; either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.**
