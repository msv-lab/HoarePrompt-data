Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position within the first `m` positions in the queue. Let's analyze why:

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue towards the front, calculating the total cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - However, the logic for adding costs is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:` is not correctly determining which cost to add. It should consider the cost to swap with the person at position `v` and the costs to pass through all intermediate positions `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Handling of Intermediate Costs (`b_k`)**:
   - The program incorrectly adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost without considering the actual range of positions `k` that Kirill would need to pass through to reach position `v`.
   - The correct approach should involve maintaining a running total of the costs `b_k` for all positions `k` that Kirill passes through when moving from his current position to position `v`.

3. **Initialization and Best Cost Tracking**:
   - The variable `best` is initialized to a very large value (`10 ** 12`), which is fine, but the way `best` is updated does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The update `if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:` only considers the cost to swap with the person at position `v` but does not account for the cumulative cost of passing through intermediate positions.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

- **Expected Output**: `14`
- **Explanation**: To reach position 1 (one of the first 2 positions), Kirill can swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then pass through the person at position 1 (cost 4). Total cost = 3 + 4 = 7. However, to ensure the minimum cost, Kirill should swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then swap with the person at position 1 (cost 7). Total cost = 3 + 7 = 10. But the optimal solution involves swapping with the person at position 3 (cost 6) and then passing through the person at position 2 (cost 3) and the person at position 1 (cost 4). Total cost = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13. However, the optimal solution is actually swapping with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then passing through the person at position 1 (cost 4) and then swapping with the person at position 1 again (cost 7). Total cost = 3 + 4 + 7 = 14.

The provided program does not handle these intermediate costs correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
