To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each pair of integers `(n, m)`.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. For each iteration, the loop reads a pair of integers `(n, m)` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. The conditions are:
- If `n == m`, print 'Yes'.
- If `m > n`, print 'No'.
- If `m == n - 1`, print 'Yes'.
- If both `m` and `n` are even, print 'Yes'.
- If both `m` and `n` are odd, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

After processing all `t` pairs, the loop will have finished executing, and the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` will reflect the state after the last iteration.

Here's the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **The loop has completed all `t` iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `m` hold the values from the last test case processed. The program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each of the `t` test cases based on the given conditions.**

In simpler terms, the loop has gone through all the test cases, and the program has printed the appropriate 'Yes' or 'No' for each pair of integers `(n, m)`. The loop counter `i` is now equal to `t`, and `n` and `m` contain the values from the last test case.
