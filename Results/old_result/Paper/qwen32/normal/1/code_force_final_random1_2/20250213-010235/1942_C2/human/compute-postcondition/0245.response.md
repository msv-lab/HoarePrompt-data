Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `next_elem` is determined based on the condition `i == x - 1`. If true, `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`; otherwise, it is set to `a[i + 1]`. The values of `x` and the fact that `i` is incremented by 1 remain unchanged.
