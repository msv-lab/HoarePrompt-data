To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior:

The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 2*n with a step of 2. This means it will iterate exactly `n` times (since the range function generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including 2*n, stepping by 2 each time).

Here's the loop again for reference:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    score += l[i]
```

During each iteration, the loop adds the value at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. The variable `i` takes on values 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1) during these iterations.

Thus, after all `n` iterations, the `score` will be the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1) of the list `l`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `l` remains the same sorted list of integers derived from the new input.
- `score` will be the sum of elements at even indices of the list `l`.
- `i` will be the last value it took in the loop, which is 2*(n-1), but since the loop has ended, `i` does not retain this value outside the loop context.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices of `l` (i.e., `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*(n-1)]`)**.
