Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `(x - n * (x // i))` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is greater than 0; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is incremented by 1.**
