The given code increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. This means the value associated with the key `b[i]` in `cnt_b` will increase by 1.

Given the initial state, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is initially `0`. After executing the line `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1`, the value corresponding to the key `b[i]` in `cnt_b` will be `1` if it was `0` before, or it will be incremented by `1` if it had a different value.

Since the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the code snippet provided, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and the value for the key `b[i]` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
