### Reasoning:

The provided code is supposed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the code provided in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve this problem. Instead, `func_15()` appears to be calculating something related to the divisor sum function, which is unrelated to the given problem's requirements.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: `func_15()` calculates a value based on the formula \(\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac{n + j}{j^2}\) where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of \(n + 1\). This formula does not correspond to counting the number of pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

2. **Lack of GCD Calculation**: The problem requires checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided code does not perform any GCD calculations or checks related to this condition.

3. **Misuse of Input Values**: The function `func_15()` takes `n` and `m` as inputs, but it only uses `n` in its calculations and completely ignores `m`. This is inconsistent with the problem statement, which requires considering both `n` and `m` to count valid pairs.

### Correctness:

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
