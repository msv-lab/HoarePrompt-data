Given the initial state, we know that `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the input. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `i` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

The `print` statement outputs the product of `A` and `B`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are positive integers read from the input)**
