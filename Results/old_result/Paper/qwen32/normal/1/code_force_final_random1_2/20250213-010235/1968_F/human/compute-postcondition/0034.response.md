Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is 6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and is at least 5, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `a[6]` which is the integer value of `data[5]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0, `pf[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `pf[6]` which is `data[4] ^ data[5]`, `mp` is `{0: [4], data[4]: [5], data[4] ^ data[5]: []}` if `pf[6]` is not in `mp`; otherwise, `mp` remains unchanged, and `i` is 6.**
