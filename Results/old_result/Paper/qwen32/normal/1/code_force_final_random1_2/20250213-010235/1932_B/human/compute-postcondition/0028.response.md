The code snippet provided resets the variable `year` to 0. It does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains decreased by 1, `n` remains the input integer, and `a` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **The final value of `year` after processing all elements in the list `a` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
