### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is optimally rearranged. To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. In both cases, the beauty of the array is equivalent to the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. This is because the intermediate differences will cancel out in the summation, leaving only the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the last element (maximum) and the first element (minimum). This approach correctly computes the maximum possible beauty of the array as per the problem statement.
