The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2` directly for its execution; it simply runs `t` times.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. Since the loop has just completed one iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `t` is now `t - 1`; `a` and `b` are integers read from input. If at least one of `a` or `b` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2` if `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b`; otherwise, `b1` and `b2` are both set to `b // 2` if `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no changes are made to `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2`.**
