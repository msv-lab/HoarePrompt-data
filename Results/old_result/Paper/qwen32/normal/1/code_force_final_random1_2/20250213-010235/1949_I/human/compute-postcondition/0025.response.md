The code assigns the value `1` to `coef[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `1`, so `coef[1]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is `1` and `coef[1]` which is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, `i` is 1**.

In simpler terms, the only change is that `coef[1]` is now `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
