The code appends a new element to the list `gr`. Given that `gr` initially contains two elements (both input strings), after appending another input string, `gr` will now contain three elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing three elements (all input strings), `ans` is undefined, `i` is 2**.
