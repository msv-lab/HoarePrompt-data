Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
