The code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `j` is either 1 (if `x` equals 1) or 0 (otherwise). After appending `j` to `c`, the list `c` will now contain one more element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element; `p` is [0, i]; `c` is [0, j]; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.**
