Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variables `zero` and `one` have been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
