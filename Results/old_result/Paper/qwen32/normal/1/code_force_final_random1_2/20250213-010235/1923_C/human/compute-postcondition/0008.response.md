Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is a list containing a single element `0`; `c` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `x` is equal to 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
