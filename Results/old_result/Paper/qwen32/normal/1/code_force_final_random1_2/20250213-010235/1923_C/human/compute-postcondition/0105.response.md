Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `i` and `j` have been explicitly set to 0 by the given code snippet. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`) retain their initial values.
