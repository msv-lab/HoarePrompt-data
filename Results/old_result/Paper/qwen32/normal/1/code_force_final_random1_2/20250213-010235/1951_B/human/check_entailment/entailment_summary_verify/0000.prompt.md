You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the player's cow, and a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. For each test case, it determines the position of the player's cow relative to the cows with higher ratings and returns a specific index based on the conditions described. The return value can be `n - 1` if no cow has a higher rating, `k - 1` if the cow with the next highest rating is at index 0, or various other indices calculated based on the positions of the cows with higher ratings compared to the player's cow.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the scenario where the cow's position `k` is swapped with another cow to maximize the number of wins. Additionally, there are several issues with the logic and variables used within the function.

Here are some specific issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Indices**: The function `func_1` attempts to find indices of cows with ratings higher than the cow at position `k`. However, it breaks after finding two such indices, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy for maximizing wins.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not correctly handle edge cases, such as when the cow at position `k` has the highest rating or when the cow at position `k` is already in a position that maximizes its wins without swapping.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Wins**: The calculation of the number of wins is flawed. For example, the function returns `n - 1` if no higher-rated cows are found, which is incorrect because the cow cannot win against itself or cows that have already won previous matches.

4. **Unnecessary Print Statements**: There are unnecessary print statements inside the function (`if k == 14: print(ind)`), which should be removed as they do not contribute to the solution.

5. **Undefined Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used within `func_1`, but it is not defined within the scope of the function. This will cause a `NameError`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be rewritten to correctly simulate the tournament and evaluate the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k` with and without swapping. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins_with_swap(n, k, ratings):
    # Calculate wins without swapping
    def calculate_wins(start_index):
        wins = 0
        current_rating = ratings[start_index]
        for i in range(start_index + 1, n):
            if current_rating > ratings[i]:
                wins += 1
            else:
                current_rating = ratings[i]
        return wins

    # Wins without swapping
    wins_without_swap = calculate_wins(k - 1)

    # Try swapping with each other cow and calculate wins
    max_wins = wins_without_swap
    for i in range(n):
        if i != k - 1:
            # Swap ratings
            ratings[k - 1], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k - 1]
            # Calculate wins after swap
            wins_with_swap = calculate_wins(k - 1)
            # Restore original ratings
            ratings[k - 1], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k - 1]
            # Update max wins
            max_wins = max(max_wins, wins_with_swap)

    return max_wins

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_wins_with_swap(n, k, ratings))
```

This corrected version simulates the tournament for both scenarios (with and without swapping) and calculates the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`.
