To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 ** power)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of the given conditions:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable does not directly affect the calculation in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `n_cases`**: It is an integer greater than 0. This also does not directly influence the calculation in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `i`**: It is initialized to 0. Again, this variable does not impact the `print` statement.
4. **Variable `n`**: It is defined as `log2(original value of n)`. However, the "original value of n" is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `n` from the given information.
5. **Variable `power`**: It is initially not equal to `n` and is then decreased by 1. This means `power` is one less than whatever `n` is.

Given that `power` is `n - 1`, and `n` is `log2(original value of n)`, we can infer that `power` is `log2(original value of n) - 1`.

When the `print(2 ** power)` statement is executed, it will print `2` raised to the power of `power`. Since `power` is `log2(original value of n) - 1`, the expression becomes `2 ** (log2(original value of n) - 1)`.

Using properties of logarithms, we can simplify this:
\[ 2^{(\log_2(\text{original value of n}) - 1)} = \frac{2^{\log_2(\text{original value of n})}}{2} = \frac{\text{original value of n}}{2} \]

Therefore, the output will be half of the original value of `n`.

However, since the "original value of n" is not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the original value of `n`.

Output: **(original value of n) / 2 (where the original value of n is the value used to compute n as log2(original value of n))**
