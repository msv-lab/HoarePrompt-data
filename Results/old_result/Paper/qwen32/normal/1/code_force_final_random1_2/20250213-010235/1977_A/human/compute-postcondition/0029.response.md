Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is `i + 1`. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, so we can assume it was defined somewhere before this snippet and is being incremented by 1.
- `n` is the first integer read from a new input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the same new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('Yes')` statement is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
