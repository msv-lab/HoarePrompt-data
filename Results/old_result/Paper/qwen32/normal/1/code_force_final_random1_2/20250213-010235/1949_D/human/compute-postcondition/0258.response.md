The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` will now include the additional character 'S' at the end.

Given the initial state, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged except for `nx` which gets updated.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `nx` has 'S' appended to its original value.**
