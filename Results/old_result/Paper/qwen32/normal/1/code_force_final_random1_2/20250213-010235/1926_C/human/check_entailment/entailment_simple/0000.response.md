### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of finding the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the requirements:

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to 200,000 (the maximum possible value of `n`).
   - For each integer `i`, it computes the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function and adds this to the cumulative `sum`.
   - The cumulative `sum` is stored in the list `A` at index `i-1`. This means `A[i-1]` will contain the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `num` and calculates the sum of its digits.
   - It does so by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` (using integer division `num // 10`).
   - The function correctly returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - After precomputing the sums, the program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum stored in `A[n-1]`.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness**: The program correctly precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to 200,000 and efficiently handles up to 10,000 test cases by simply looking up the precomputed result.
- **Efficiency**: Precomputing the results for all possible values of `n` ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and a time limit of 0.5 seconds).

### Conclusion:

The program is both correct and efficient given the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
