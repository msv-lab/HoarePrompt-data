Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, then `n` equals `m`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` remains greater than `n`. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` retains the value `n - 1`. If `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, then either both `m` and `n` are even, or both are odd, or at least one of them is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input. If `n` equals `m`, or `m` > `n`, or `m` equals `n - 1`, or `m` and `n` are both even, the behavior is as described in the if part. Otherwise, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` retain their values as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` and `m` are integers read from input. Regardless of whether `n` equals `m` or not, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
