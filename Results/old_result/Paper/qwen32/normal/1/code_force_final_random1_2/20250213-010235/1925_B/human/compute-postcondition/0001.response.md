The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input.**
