You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions related to the values of `n` and `m`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can add is `n`.
- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible by adding one cube at a time.
- If `n` is greater than `m`, it's possible if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each pair of operations (add then remove or remove then add) results in no net change, and we can adjust the number of cubes by an even number.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the conditions in the program:

1. `if n == m:` 
   - This correctly handles the case where the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes.
   
2. `elif m > n:`
   - This correctly handles the case where the number of cubes desired is more than the number of moves available.
   
3. `elif m == n - 1:`
   - This condition is unnecessary and incorrect. If `m == n - 1`, it should still be possible if `n - m` is even, which it is since `n - m = 1` is odd. This condition can be removed or combined into the next ones.
   
4. `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`
   - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to reach `m` cubes from `n` moves.
   
5. `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`
   - Similarly, this condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Again, this alone is not sufficient.
   
6. `else:`
   - This handles all other cases, but due to the incorrect handling of even/odd differences, it might incorrectly return 'No' in some cases.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be to check if `n - m` is non-negative and even, or if `n - m` is zero.

### Revised Conditions:
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases due to the unnecessary and incorrect conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
