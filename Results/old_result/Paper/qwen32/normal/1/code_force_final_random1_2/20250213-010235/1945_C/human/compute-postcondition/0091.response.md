The given code calculates the percentage of '1's excluding the current character at index `i` in the string `s`. This is stored in the variable `one_perc`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `one_perc`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here is the calculation for `one_perc`:

- `one` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0.
- `o` is the total count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is the current index in the string `s`.

So, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is a list containing `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.
