Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is 8
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is `[ (n + 1) // 2 ]`
- `pow` is 1
- `tot` is 0
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

The code snippet is:
```python
L.append(m)
```

The variable `L` initially contains one element, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. After executing `L.append(m)`, the list `L` will now contain two elements: the original element and the value of `m`.

Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, and the initial list `L` already contains `(n + 1) // 2`, the new list `L` will be `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]`.

No other variables are modified by the code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 8, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]`, `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains 8, `n` remains `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` remains an input integer, `L` now contains two elements both equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `pow` remains 1, `tot` remains 0, and `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`.
