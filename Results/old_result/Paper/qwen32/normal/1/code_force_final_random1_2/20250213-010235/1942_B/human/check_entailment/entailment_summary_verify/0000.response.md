To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic used to construct the permutation `p` from the array `a`. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Recap
Given an array `a` of length `n`, we need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the given set of numbers.

### Provided Solution Analysis
The provided solution initializes `mex` to `n` and iterates through the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

### Issues with the Provided Solution
1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The provided solution incorrectly assumes that `mex` can be updated directly based on the difference between `mex` and `ar[i]`. This does not guarantee that `mex` will always represent the true minimum non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p`.
2. **Range Violation**: The solution does not ensure that the values in `res` (which are supposed to be the elements of `p`) remain within the range `[0, n-1]`.
3. **Permutation Validity**: The solution does not ensure that `res` forms a valid permutation of the numbers from `0` to `n-1`.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach involves maintaining a set of available numbers (initially all numbers from `0` to `n-1`) and constructing `p` in forward order. For each `i`, we calculate `MEX` as the smallest number not in the set of already chosen numbers, and then determine `p[i]` such that `a[i] = MEX - p[i]`. After determining `p[i]`, we remove `p[i]` from the set of available numbers.

### Implementation of Correct Approach
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        available = set(range(n))
        res = [None] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = min(available)
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            available.remove(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Verification Using Function Summary
The function summary provided describes the logic of the original program but does not account for the issues mentioned above. The corrected approach ensures that:
- `mex` is correctly calculated as the smallest number not in the set of already chosen numbers.
- Each `p[i]` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `res` forms a valid permutation of the numbers from `0` to `n-1`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. The program does not guarantee the construction of a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions.

**Final: False**
