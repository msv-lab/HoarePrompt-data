Postcondition: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 7, `j` is 7, and `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[6][6]` if `xx[6][6]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[6][5]`. Specifically, if `xx[6][6]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[6][6]`. If `xx[6][6]` is equal to '?', `nx` is updated based on whether `i` or `j` is found in the first quarter of the list `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`). If `i` or `j` is found in `sa[:n // 4]`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, if `xx[6][5]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[6][5]`; if `xx[6][5]` is equal to '?', 'S' is appended to `nx`.**
