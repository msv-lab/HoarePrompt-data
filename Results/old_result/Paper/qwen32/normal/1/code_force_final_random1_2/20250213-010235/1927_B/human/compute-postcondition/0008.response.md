To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is `j` and `l` in this case.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for j in range(l):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, and `l` remains unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the current state of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` had a specific value (let's call it `j_prev`).
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

2. **Determine if the loop can continue:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `l`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j_prev + 1` must be less than `l`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `j` at that point as `j_prev`. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

Since `l` does not change and remains the same throughout the loop, we don't need to adjust its value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one more character than before, specifically the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, `j` is `j_prev + 1` where `j_prev` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `j_prev`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one more character than before, specifically the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, let's assume `j` was `j_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one more character than before, specifically the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can simply say:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one more character than before, specifically the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, `j` is incremented by 1**.

So the final answer is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one more character than before, specifically the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, `j` is incremented by 1**.
