The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Given that `r` was initially 4, it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '>'**
