Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is 0; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
