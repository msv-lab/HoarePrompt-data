Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2`. If `s[i]` is `'>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1, and `r`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is not `'>'`, and `l <= r`, then if `l` is 0, `r` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `r` is set to 1, `a` is calculated as `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `2`. If `s[i]` is not `'>'`, and `l > r`, then if `r` was initially 0, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r_initial - 1]` and `b` is set to `1 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `1` or `4 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `4`.**
