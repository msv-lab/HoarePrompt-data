The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given the initial state, `pow` is initially 1. After executing the code, `pow` becomes 2.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The conditions involving `a` and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 9, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2, and `tot` is `a`. If `a` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `a + a`, then `a` is less than `k` while `k` is less than or equal to `2*a`. Otherwise, the condition `a < k and k <= 2*a` does not hold.**
