N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented by an N x M grid where each cell contains either ".." (empty), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), or ".Q" (Quaffle). There is at least one goal for each team, and exactly one Quaffle. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of actions. Each action is a string containing a valid entity identifier followed by a valid action (U, D, L, R for movement, C followed by a ball identifier for catching, or T for throwing the Quaffle).
