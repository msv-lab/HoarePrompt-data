The code snippet sets the variable `score` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `score`, which was the sum of elements at even indices of the list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is 0**.
