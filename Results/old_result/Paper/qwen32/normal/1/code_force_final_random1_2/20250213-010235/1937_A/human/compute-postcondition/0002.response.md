The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `n_cases`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**
