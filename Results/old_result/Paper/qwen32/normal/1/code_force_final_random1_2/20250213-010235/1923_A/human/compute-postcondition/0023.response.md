Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (each being either 0 or 1). For each test case, the function returns the index (0-based) of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in the list. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 1 in each list.**
