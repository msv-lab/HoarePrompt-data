Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` edges representing the tree structure, and a list of `t` integers representing the starting node for each round. The function returns the result of some computation based on the tree structure and the starting node, though the specific computation is not detailed here.**
