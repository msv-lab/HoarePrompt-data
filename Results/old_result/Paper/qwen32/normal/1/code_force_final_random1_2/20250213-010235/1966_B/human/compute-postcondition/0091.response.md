The code snippet provided is:

```python
gr = []
```

This line reassigns the variable `gr` to an empty list, effectively clearing its previous contents.

Given the initial state, `gr` was a list containing `n` strings. After executing the given line, `gr` becomes an empty list.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is [], If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'` and `i` is `n - 1`.**

However, since `gr` is now an empty list, the condition `If gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` cannot be evaluated because `gr[0]` and `gr[n - 1]` do not exist. Thus, the values of `ans` and `i` remain undefined based on the current state of `gr`.

To accurately reflect the state, we should acknowledge that the condition involving `gr` is no longer valid:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is []. The condition involving `gr` is no longer valid, so `ans` and `i` are undefined.**
