The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated as `A[-1] + (5 - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A)`, but since `A` is being modified, `A[-1]` now refers to the last element before the append operation.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 5.
- `i` is 5.
- `x` is `A[-1] + (5 - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A)`.

After appending `x` to `A`, the new state is:
- `s` remains a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains greater than 5.
- `i` remains 5.
- `x` is appended to `A`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 5; `i` is 5; `x` is appended to `A`.**
