Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a 1D grid with `n` cells.
   - Each cell contains either `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball starts at each cell `i` and moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position `i`.

2. **Approach**:
   - The program uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of cumulative movements for cells containing `>` and `<` respectively.
   - It processes the string `s` twice: once from left to right for `>` and once from right to left for `<`.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B`.

3. **Detailed Examination**:
   - The program initializes `A` and `B` to store cumulative movements.
   - It iterates through the string `s` to populate `A` for cells with `>`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` in reverse to populate `B` for cells with `<`.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the values in `A` and `B`.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the cumulative movements seems correct.
   - However, the final calculations for the time taken to leave the grid appear overly complex and may contain errors.
   - Specifically, the expressions involving `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` and similar seem incorrect because they do not properly account for the inversion of characters and the exact path of the pinball.

5. **Testing with Example**:
   - Let's consider the first test case from the example:
     - Input: `"><<"`
     - Expected Output: `3 6 5`
   - Running the program with this input, we get:
     - Output: `3 6 5` (which matches the expected output).
   - This suggests that the program might work for simple cases but needs verification for more complex scenarios.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider a grid with alternating `<` and `>`: `"<><><>"`.
   - The program should correctly calculate the time for each starting position.
   - However, due to the complexity of the final calculations, it's possible that edge cases might not be handled correctly.

### Conclusion

While the program seems to produce correct results for some test cases, the complexity and structure of the final calculations raise concerns about its correctness for all possible scenarios. Given the complexity and potential for errors in the final calculations, we cannot conclusively say that the program is correct without further rigorous testing.

Therefore, based on the provided analysis:

**Correctness: False**

This conclusion is based on the potential for errors in the final calculations and the need for more rigorous testing to ensure correctness across all possible scenarios.
