The code appends the value `0` to the list `B`. Since `B` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was initially an empty list `[]`. After appending `0`, `B` becomes `[0]`.

The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]; `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`; `B` is [0]**.
