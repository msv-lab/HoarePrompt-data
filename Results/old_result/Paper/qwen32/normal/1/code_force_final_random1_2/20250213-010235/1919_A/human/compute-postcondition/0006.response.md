The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` represents the number of remaining test cases. Since one iteration of the loop has just completed, `t` should be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `t` is decremented by 1**  
State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Note: After decrementing `t`, it must still be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to potentially execute again.
