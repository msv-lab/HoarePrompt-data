Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is not equal to the length of `a` (now `i` is incremented by 1), `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers where `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i]` is `a[i]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `new`, and `new2`) remain unchanged. The condition that `i` is not equal to the length of `a` still holds true since `i` has only been incremented by 1.
