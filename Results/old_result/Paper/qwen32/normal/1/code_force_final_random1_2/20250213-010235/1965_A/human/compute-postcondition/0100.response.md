Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is also incremented by 1, regardless of whether `j` is odd or even.**
