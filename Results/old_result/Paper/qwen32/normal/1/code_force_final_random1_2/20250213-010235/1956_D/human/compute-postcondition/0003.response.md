To determine the output of the `print(s, m)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided and understand the roles of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `a`: A list of integers derived from the input.
- `n`: An integer value provided by the input.
- `s`: The first return value of the function `func_2`.
- `m`: The second return value of the function `func_2`.

### Analysis:
The code snippet provided does not include the definition of `func_2`, so we cannot determine the exact values of `s` and `m` without knowing what `func_2` does. However, we can describe their values in terms of the function's behavior.

### Description of Variables:
- `s`: This variable holds the first return value of `func_2`. Without the definition of `func_2`, we can only say that `s` is whatever value `func_2` returns as its first output.
- `m`: This variable holds the second return value of `func_2`. Similarly, `m` is whatever value `func_2` returns as its second output.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific details about `func_2`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's return values.

Output: **s, m (where s is the first return value of func_2 and m is the second return value of func_2)**
