To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used in the print statement:

- `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers.
- `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
- The current value of `A` is even.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Multiplication**: First, `A * C` is computed. Since both `A` and `C` are positive integers, their product will also be a positive integer.
2. **Division**: Next, the product `A * C` is divided by 2. Since `A` is even, `A * C` will always be even (because any even number multiplied by any integer results in an even number). Therefore, dividing an even number by 2 will result in an integer.
3. **Conversion to Integer**: The `int()` function is applied to the result of the division. However, since the division of two integers where the numerator is even will already yield an integer, this conversion does not change the value.

Thus, the expression `int(A * C / 2)` simplifies to `A * C // 2` (integer division), which is guaranteed to be an integer because `A` is even.

Given the initial state, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without specific values for `A` and `C`. However, we know the expression evaluates to an integer.

Output: **(A * C) // 2 (where A is an even positive integer and C is a positive integer such that B * 2 >= C)**
