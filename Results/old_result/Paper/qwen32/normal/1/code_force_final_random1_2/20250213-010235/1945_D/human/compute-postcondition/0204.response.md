The code snippet `custo += a_values[y]` increments the variable `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. This means that the current value of `custo` is added to the value at index `y` in the list `a_values`.

Given the initial state, `custo` was already the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the specified range, with additional conditions applied when `y` was 2. After executing the given line of code, `custo` will now include the value of `a_values[y]` added to its previous value.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` plus `a_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `b_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `a_values[y]`. If `y` is 2, `custo` is further incremented by either `b_values[2]` or `a_values[2]` depending on the condition, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `y` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration + 1.**
