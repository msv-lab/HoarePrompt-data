To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `tc > 0`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4
- `tc` is at least 1 (since it was at least 2 initially)
- `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements
- `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1` where `len(arr) > 2`
- `i` is `n-1`

The only variable in the loop head is `tc`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Since `tc` is at least 1, it already satisfies the condition `tc > 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1` where `len(arr) > 2`, and `i` is `n-1`**
