The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Given that `mex` was initially `n` and `ar[i]` is an element from the list `ar`, the new value of `mex` is `n - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `n - ar[i]` and other elements are `None`, `mex` is `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`. The current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**
