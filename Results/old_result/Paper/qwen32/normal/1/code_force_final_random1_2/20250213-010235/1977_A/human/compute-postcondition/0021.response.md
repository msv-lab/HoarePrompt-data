Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`. If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, then `m` retains the value `n - 1`. Otherwise, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and if both `m` and `n` are even, they retain their even status. Otherwise, either both `m` and `n` are odd, or at least one of them is even.**
