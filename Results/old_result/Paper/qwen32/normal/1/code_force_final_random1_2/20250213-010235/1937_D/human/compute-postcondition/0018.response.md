Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 4. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (4 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` includes `x` as its last element.**
