Output State: **`tt` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

Explanation: The variable `tt` is assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are yet to be read from the input.
