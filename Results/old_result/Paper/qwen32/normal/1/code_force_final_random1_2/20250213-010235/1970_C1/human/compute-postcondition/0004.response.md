The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
