The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `power` is either equal to the original value of `n` (if the initial condition `power == n` was true) or decreased by 1 (if the initial condition `power == n` was false).**
