The code snippet updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` by setting it to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. This means that the value of `d1[i + 2]` is now one more than the previous value stored at `d1[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `d1[i + 2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input, and the difference between `l[i+1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i-1]`.**
