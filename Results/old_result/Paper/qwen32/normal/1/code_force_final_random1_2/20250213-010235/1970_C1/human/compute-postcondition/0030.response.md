The variable `tmp` is reassigned the value of `z`. The previous state of `tmp` being a leaf node of the tree and `lst[tmp]` being an empty list is no longer directly relevant to `tmp` itself, but remains true for the original value of `tmp` before reassignment. The variable `two` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`tmp` is `z`; `lst[tmp]` is an empty list; `two` is `True`.**
