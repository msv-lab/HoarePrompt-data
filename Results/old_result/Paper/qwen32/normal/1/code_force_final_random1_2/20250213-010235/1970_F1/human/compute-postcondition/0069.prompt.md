Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `goal` contains positions of 'G' elements categorized by prefix ('B' or not), `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is the list of strings read from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, and `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', `elements` includes `line[ind]` mapped to `(1, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers` includes `line[ind]` with value `True`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[1]` includes `(i, ind)` and `line[ind]` is equal to 'G'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, `ind` is 2. If `line[2]` is not '..', it is added to `elements` with the position `(1, 2)`. If `line[2]` is a player, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. If `line[2]` is not a player and `line[2][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is either 0 or 1 based on whether `line[2][0]` is 'B' or not, and `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(1, 2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, `ind` is 3. If `line[3]` is not '..' and `isPlayer(line[3])` is true, no additional changes occur. If `line[3]` is not '..' and `isPlayer(line[3])` is false and `line[3][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[3][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(1, 3)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
