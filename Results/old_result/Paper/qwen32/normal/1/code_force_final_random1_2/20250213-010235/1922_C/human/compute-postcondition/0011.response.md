Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0. If `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[2]` remains 1. Otherwise, `d1[2]` is updated to `l[1] - l[0]`.**
