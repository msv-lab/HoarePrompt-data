The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the value of the first element of the sorted list `l` (since `i` is 0) to the `score`. Given that `score` was initially 0, it now equals the first element of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[0]`, `i` is 0**.
