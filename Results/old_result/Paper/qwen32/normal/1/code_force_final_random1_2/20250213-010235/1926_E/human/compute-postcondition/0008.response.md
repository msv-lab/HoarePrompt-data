To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `while n:`. This loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `L` is `[m]`
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

We need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute again. Let's analyze the transformation of `n`:

1. Initially, `n` is some integer.
2. In each iteration, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

To ensure the loop executes again, `n` must be non-zero after this update. Let's consider the possible values of `n`:

- If `n` is even, say `n = 2x`, then `(n + 1) // 2` is `x + 0.5` rounded down, which is `x`. So, `n` becomes `2x - x = x`.
- If `n` is odd, say `n = 2x + 1`, then `(n + 1) // 2` is `2x + 2 // 2 = x + 1`. So, `n` becomes `2x + 1 - (x + 1) = x`.

In both cases, `n` is reduced by approximately half. To ensure the loop executes again, `n` must be greater than zero after this reduction. Therefore, before the reduction, `n` must be greater than 1 (since reducing 1 by half results in 0).

So, the state should be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 1 before the update.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is `[m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
