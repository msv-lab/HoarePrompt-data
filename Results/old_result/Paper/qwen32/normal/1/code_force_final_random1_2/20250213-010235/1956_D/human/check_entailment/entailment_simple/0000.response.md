### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided annotated states.

#### Overview of the Program:
1. **Main Function (`func_3`)**:
   - Reads the input values.
   - Calls `func_2` to compute the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - Prints the results.

2. **Recursive Function (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is supposed to recursively split the array and apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum.
   - If the sum of the current segment is less than or equal to the square of its length, it applies the MEX operation to make all elements equal to the length of the segment.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element and splits the segment around this element, recursively processing the left and right parts.

3. **Operation Application (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is supposed to apply the MEX operation to a segment of the array.
   - If the segment consists of a single element and it is not zero, it sets it to zero.
   - Otherwise, it sets all elements in the segment to the length of the segment and records the operation.

4. **Sum Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - Initializes the operations list.
   - Calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
   - Returns the final sum and the operations list.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Use of `ops` Variable**:
  - The `ops` list is defined locally within `func_2` but used globally within `recursive_maximize_sum`. This leads to undefined behavior because `ops` is not passed as an argument to `recursive_maximize_sum`.
  - The same issue occurs with the `a` list in `recursive_maximize_sum`.

- **Incorrect Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
  - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not correctly aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.
  - The logic to find the maximum element and split the array around it is not optimal for maximizing the sum.

- **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
  - The function is supposed to apply the MEX operation, but it incorrectly sets all elements to `r - l + 1` without computing the actual MEX.
  - The condition to check if `a[l]` is not zero and setting it to zero is not relevant to the MEX operation.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the array using the MEX operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
