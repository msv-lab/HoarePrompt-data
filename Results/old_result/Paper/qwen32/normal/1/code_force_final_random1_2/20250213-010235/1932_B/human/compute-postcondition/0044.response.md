The code appends the value of `current_year` to the list `results`. The value of `current_year` remains unchanged and is still equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`.

Output State: **`current_year` is equal to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`; `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element.**
