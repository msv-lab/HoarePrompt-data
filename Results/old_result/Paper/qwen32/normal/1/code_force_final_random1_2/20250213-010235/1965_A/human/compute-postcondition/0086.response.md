The given code snippet only contains the line `test = True`. This line assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `test`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for those variables, except for the new variable `test` which is now `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `i` is `i + 1`, `test` is `True`.**
