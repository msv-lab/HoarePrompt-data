The given Python code snippet calls `func_5(l)`, where `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. This function call does not assign its result to any variable or modify any existing variables directly. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged after the execution of `func_5(l)`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`**.
