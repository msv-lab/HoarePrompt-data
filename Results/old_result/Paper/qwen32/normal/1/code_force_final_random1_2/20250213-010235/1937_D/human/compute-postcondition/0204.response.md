Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a value based on the configuration of these characters in the string. Specifically, if the string represents a balanced sequence where every '<' has a corresponding '>' that follows it without any unmatched '>' before its matching '<', the function may return a specific value (e.g., 0 or a count of valid pairs). Otherwise, if there are unmatched '<' or '>', the function may return a different value indicating imbalance (e.g., -1 or the count of unmatched characters). However, without specific output cases provided, the exact return values for different scenarios are not detailed.**
