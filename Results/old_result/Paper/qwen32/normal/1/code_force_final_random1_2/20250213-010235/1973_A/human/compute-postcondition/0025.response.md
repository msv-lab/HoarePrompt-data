Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed), `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as described in the initial state.
