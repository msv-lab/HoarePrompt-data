Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is `int(data[idx])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary mapping `0` to `[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `n + 3 + 2*q + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
