The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, the element `a[1]` is targeted.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers read from the input with `m` being at least 1.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b`. The count of `a[1]` in `cnt_b` is now decreased by 1.
- `b_values` remains a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `i` remains 1.
- `curr` remains 1 if `a[1]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` with the count of `a[1]` decreased by 1; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 1; `curr` is 1 if `a[1]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is 0.**
