Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `i` is `m`. `b_values` remains unchanged. `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` within the first `m` elements that are also in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if its original value was greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `b_values` remains unchanged. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. If `a[m + 1]` is in `b_values`, an additional count for `a[m + 1]` is added to `cnt_b`. The count for `a[2m + 1]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1. If `a[i + m]` (which is `a[2m + 1]`) is in `b_values`, `curr` is increased by 1. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m + 1`, `b_values` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]] > 0`, then `curr` is decreased by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b_values` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
