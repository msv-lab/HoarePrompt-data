The code snippet provided decrements the count of `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and its count in `cnt_b` was incremented earlier. Decrementing this count will reverse the effect of that increment.

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, `curr` was decremented by 1 earlier when the count was incremented. Now, decrementing the count again will mean `curr` should be incremented back by 1.

Therefore, the new value of `curr` will be the previous value of `curr` plus 1 (if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement).

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` will depend on the new value of `curr` compared to `k`.

Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement; `n` is greater than `m`; `m` and `k` remain unchanged; `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `i` is `m`; `b_values` remains unchanged; `ans` is 1 if the new value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
