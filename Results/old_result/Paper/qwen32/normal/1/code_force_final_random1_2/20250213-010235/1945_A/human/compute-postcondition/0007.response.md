Let's break down the given code snippet and determine what it will print based on the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`.
- `c` is an integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Analysis:
The print statement uses a tuple indexing trick to choose between two values based on a condition.

1. **Tuple Construction**:
   - The tuple is `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding a positive.
   - So, the tuple becomes `(a + b // 3, -1)`.

2. **Indexing**:
   - The index for this tuple is determined by the condition `c < b % 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` evaluates to `True`, the index is `0`, and the value printed is `a + b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` evaluates to `False`, the index is `1`, and the value printed is `-1`.

### Final Output Description:
The value printed depends on the condition `c < b % 3`.

- If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be `a + b // 3`.
- If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `-1`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical value without knowing the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the condition.

Output: **(a + b // 3 if c < b % 3 else -1)**
