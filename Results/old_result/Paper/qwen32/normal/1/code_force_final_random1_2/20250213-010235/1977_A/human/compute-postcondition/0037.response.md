The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `t`. According to the problem statement, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and `i` has been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `t` for the loop to continue executing.

Since `n` and `m` are read from new inputs and their values do not affect the loop condition directly (only the behavior inside the loop), they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input**.

However, since `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the start of the next iteration, we should explicitly state that `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input**.

To clarify the adjustment:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their values as described.

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `m` is the second integer read from the new input**.

For simplicity and clarity in the context of the loop head:

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`**.
