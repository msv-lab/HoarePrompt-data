To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `m` must be at least 3.
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 2.
- `gcd(x, y) == 1`.
- `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus 1.

First, let's calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` with the current values of `x` and `y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`

Now, let's check the conditions:
- `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `8 <= n`. Since `n` must be at least 6, this condition is satisfied as long as `n` is at least 8.
- `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `8 <= m`. Since `m` must be at least 3, this condition is satisfied as long as `m` is at least 8.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, both `n` and `m` need to be at least 8.

State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus 1**.
