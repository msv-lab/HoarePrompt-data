The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about various variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, `ok`) and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Based on this understanding, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
