The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Given that `x` is calculated as `A_last + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` was initially an empty list, `A_last` would be undefined in the traditional sense. However, since `A` is empty, we can infer that `A_last` refers to the last element added to `A` before this operation, which does not exist in this case. For the purpose of this calculation, we consider `A_last` to be 0 because there are no previous elements in `A`.

Thus, after appending `x` to `A`, `A` will contain one element, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not an empty list, the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `x` is `0 + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`**.
