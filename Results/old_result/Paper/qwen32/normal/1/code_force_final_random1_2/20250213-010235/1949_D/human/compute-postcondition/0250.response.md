The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `j` at the start of the next iteration should be `j + 1`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged and do not affect the loop's continuation directly.

State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1**
