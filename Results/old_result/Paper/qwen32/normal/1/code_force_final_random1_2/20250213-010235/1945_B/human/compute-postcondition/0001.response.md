For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of the variables in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts. It will take values from 0 up to (but not including) `t` during each iteration.

2. **Variable `t`:** This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the problem statement, `t` is already constrained to be within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, which means `t` is always greater than 0.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the specified range and `i` is managed by the `range` function, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes. However, if we strictly adhere to the requirement of specifying the state of the objects in the loop head, we can state that `t` should be within the given range.

Therefore, the state remains as provided, with the understanding that `t` is already within the valid range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
