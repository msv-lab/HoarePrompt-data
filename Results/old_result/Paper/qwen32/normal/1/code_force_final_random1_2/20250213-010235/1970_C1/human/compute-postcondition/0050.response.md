Output State: **`queue` has one more element, `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including `neighbor`, `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.**

Explanation: The `queue` gains a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous states, with the exception that `visited` now includes `neighbor`.
