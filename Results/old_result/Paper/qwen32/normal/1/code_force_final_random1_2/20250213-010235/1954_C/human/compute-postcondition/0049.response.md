To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `i` is less than the length of list `a`.
2. The element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in list `b`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is a non-empty list of integers derived from the input with `b[0] == a[0]`.
- `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`.
- `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the states such that both conditions (`i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`) are satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `i < len(a)`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is greater than 1. This means `a` must have at least two elements.

2. **Condition `a[i] == b[i]`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`. This means the second element of `a` must be the same as the second element of `b`.

### Adjusted State:
- `a` must be a list with at least two elements.
- `b` must be a list with at least two elements, and `b[1]` must be equal to `a[1]`.
- `i` remains 1 (as it is already set to 1).

No other states (`new` and `new2`) need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers derived from the input with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `b` is a non-empty list of integers derived from the input with at least two elements and `b[1] == a[1]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`**.
