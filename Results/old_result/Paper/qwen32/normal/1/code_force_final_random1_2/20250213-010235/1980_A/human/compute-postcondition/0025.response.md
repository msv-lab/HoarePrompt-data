The code snippet `results.append(missing)` appends the current value of `missing` to the `results` list. The value of `missing` is calculated as `7 * m` for each test case. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `freq` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `missing` is 7 * m; `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case; `results` now includes the value of `missing` for the current test case.**
