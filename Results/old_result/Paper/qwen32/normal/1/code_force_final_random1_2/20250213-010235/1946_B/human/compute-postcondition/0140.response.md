Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`
- `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`
- `sm` is `0` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` is `-111`
- `j` is `j + n`
- `t` remains the same
- `b` is a list of substrings from the input
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `k` is `int(b[1])`
- `l` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
```

Impact:
- The value of `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `sm` is now `suf[1] - smin[1]`.

Output State:
- `suf` remains `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`
- `smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`
- `sm` is now `suf[1] - smin[1]`
- `j` remains `j + n`
- `t` remains the same
- `b` remains a list of substrings from the input
- `n` remains an integer greater than 0
- `k` remains `int(b[1])`
- `l` remains a list of integers from the input
- `i` remains 1

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`; `sm` is `suf[1] - smin[1]`; `j` is `j + n`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of substrings from the input; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 1**
