The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing string stored in `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` will be 'F'.

The values of `i`, `n`, `sa`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `nx` is 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`.**
