The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop head and thus irrelevant here), `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, and `y` has just completed its current iteration.

Since the loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The values of `num_fila` and `max_p` remain unchanged.

Let's denote the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration as `y_end`. At the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `y_end - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `y` is `y_end - 1`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is updated to its previous value plus `a_values[max_p]` if `a_values[max_p]` is less than `b_values[max_p]`; otherwise, `custo` is updated to its previous value plus `b_values[max_p]`**.

However, since we only need to adjust the loop head variables, the final state considering only those is:
State: **`num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `y` is `y_end - 1`**.

To make it more concrete, let's assume `y_end` was 5 (as an example). Then the state would be:
State: **`num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `y` is 4**.

But without a specific value for `y_end`, the most accurate representation is:
State: **`num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `y` is `y_end - 1`**.
