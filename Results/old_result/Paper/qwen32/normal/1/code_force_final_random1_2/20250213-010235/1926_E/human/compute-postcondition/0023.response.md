Given the code snippet `tot += a`, the variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `a`. Therefore, we can only express the new value of `tot` in terms of `a`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, and `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 10, `n` is 0, `k` is 3, `L` is a list with at least one element (e.g., `[4]`), `pow` is 1, `tot` is `tot + a`.**
