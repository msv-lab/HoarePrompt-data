The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` of the same length and composed only of digits from 1 to 9. For each test case, it generates two new numbers: one formed by taking the maximum digit at each position between `x` and `y`, and another formed by taking the minimum digit at each position between `x` and `y`. It then prints these two new numbers for each test case.
