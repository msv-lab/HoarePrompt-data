The code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum value between its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, the new value of `ans` will be the larger of its previous value and `i_prev + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`; `ans` is `max(ans, i_prev + 1)`**.
