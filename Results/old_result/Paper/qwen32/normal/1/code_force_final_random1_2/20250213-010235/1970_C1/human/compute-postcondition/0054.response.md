Output State: **`queue` has one more element `(neighbor, dist + 1)`; `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors; `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple; `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including the previous `neighbor` if it was not in `visited`; otherwise, `visited` remains unchanged, and now includes the `neighbor`; `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.**

Explanation: The `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial descriptions.
