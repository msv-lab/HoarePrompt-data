Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is 1000000000000`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The value of `total` has been updated to include the cost of passing through position `v` using `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
