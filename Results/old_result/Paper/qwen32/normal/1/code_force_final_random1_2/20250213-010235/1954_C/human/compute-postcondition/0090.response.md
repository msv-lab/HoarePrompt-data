The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `new[1]` will be set to the maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Since `b[1]` equals `a[1]`, `new[1]` will be equal to `a[1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `b` is a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements where `b[0]` equals `a[0]` and `b[1]` equals `a[1]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]` and `new[1]` is `a[1]`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`**.
