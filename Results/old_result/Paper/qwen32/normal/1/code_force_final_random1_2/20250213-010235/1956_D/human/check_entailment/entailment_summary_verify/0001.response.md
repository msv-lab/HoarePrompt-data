### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the code based on the provided problem description, the code itself, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation up to `5*10^5` times.
- The operation involves selecting a subarray from index `l` to `r`, computing the MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide a sequence of operations achieving this sum.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
   - This function is intended to recursively process the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `l` is not `0`. If not, it sets it to `0` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
   - After the recursive call, it checks if the element at `l` is not equal to `r-l+1`. If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1` and records the operation.
   - The logic here is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it uses `r-l+1` as the target value, which is not necessarily the MEX.

2. **Function `func_2(a)`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n-1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - The issue here is that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, leading to a `NameError`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r-l+1)*(r-l+1)`, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively processing the left and right parts.
   - The logic here is also flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Additionally, the condition `if s <= (r-l+1)*(r-l+1)` is not logically sound for maximizing the sum using MEX operations.

4. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - Given the issues in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, this function will not produce the correct output.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The code does not correctly compute the MEX of a subarray. Instead, it uses `r-l+1` as the target value, which is not the MEX.
- **Missing Parameter Passing**: The `ops` list is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, causing a `NameError`.
- **Flawed Logic**: The logic for splitting subarrays around the maximum element and setting subarrays to `r-l+1` is not aligned with maximizing the sum using MEX operations.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for computing the MEX and performing operations is flawed, and there are missing parameter passes that prevent the code from functioning correctly.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
