Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` has been incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise all elements have been incremented by 1; `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where `b[j]` is incremented by 3 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', otherwise `b[j]` is incremented by 1; `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string; `x` is a string read from the input; `j` is 4.**
