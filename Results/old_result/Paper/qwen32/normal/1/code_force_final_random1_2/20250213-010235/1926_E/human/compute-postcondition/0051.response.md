To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `n` and appends values to the list `L`. The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is decremented by `m`, and `m` is appended to the list `L`.

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is 9
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `L` is []
   - `pow` is 16
   - `tot` is 8

2. **First Iteration**:
   - `m = (n + 1) // 2`
   - `n = n - m`
   - `L = [m]`

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - `m = (n + 1) // 2`
   - `n = n - m`
   - `L = [previous m, current m]`

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - `m = (n + 1) // 2`
   - `n = n - m`
   - `L = [previous m, previous m, current m]`

This process continues until `n` becomes 0. At that point, the loop terminates.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n` is 7 for illustration purposes:

- **Iteration 1**:
  - `m = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`
  - `n = 7 - 4 = 3`
  - `L = [4]`

- **Iteration 2**:
  - `m = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `n = 3 - 2 = 1`
  - `L = [4, 2]`

- **Iteration 3**:
  - `m = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `n = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - `L = [4, 2, 1]`

At this point, `n` is 0, so the loop terminates.

### General Case:
For any initial value of `n`, the loop will continue until `n` becomes 0. The list `L` will contain the sequence of values of `m` calculated in each iteration.

### Final Output State:
The final output state will be when `n` is 0, and `L` will contain the sequence of values calculated during each iteration.

Given the initial state and the nature of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains 9
- `n` becomes 0
- `k` remains the input integer
- `L` contains the sequence of values calculated in each iteration
- `pow` remains 16
- `tot` remains 8

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is 9, n is 0, k is an input integer, L is the list of values calculated in each iteration, pow is 16, tot is 8.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `n` will be 0, `t`, `k`, `pow`, and `tot` will retain their initial values, and `L` will contain the sequence of values calculated in each iteration of the loop.
