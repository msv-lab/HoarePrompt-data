The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `b` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'**.
