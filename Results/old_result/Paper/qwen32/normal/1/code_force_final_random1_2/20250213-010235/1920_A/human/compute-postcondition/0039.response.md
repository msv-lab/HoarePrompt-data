To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `start`, `end`, and `num` evolve based on the constraints provided by `t` and `v` for each iteration.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: The number of iterations (provided by the user).
   - `start`: Initially set to -1.
   - `end`: Initially set to 1000000000.0.
   - `num`: An empty list.
   - `t`: Type of constraint (1, 2, or 3).
   - `v`: Value associated with the constraint.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - Read `t` and `v` as integers from the input.
     - If `t == 1` and `start < v`, update `start` to `v`.
     - If `t == 2` and `end > v`, update `end` to `v`.
     - If `t == 3`, append `v` to the list `num`.

After `n` iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `start`: The maximum value among all `v` where `t == 1`.
- `end`: The minimum value among all `v` where `t == 2`.
- `num`: A list containing all `v` where `t == 3`.

### Example Calculation
Let's assume `n = 5` and the inputs are as follows:
- Iteration 1: `t = 1`, `v = 10`
- Iteration 2: `t = 2`, `v = 50`
- Iteration 3: `t = 3`, `v = 100`
- Iteration 4: `t = 1`, `v = 20`
- Iteration 5: `t = 3`, `v = 200`

Processing these inputs:
- After Iteration 1: `start = 10`, `end = 1000000000.0`, `num = []`
- After Iteration 2: `start = 10`, `end = 50`, `num = []`
- After Iteration 3: `start = 10`, `end = 50`, `num = [100]`
- After Iteration 4: `start = 20`, `end = 50`, `num = [100]`
- After Iteration 5: `start = 20`, `end = 50`, `num = [100, 200]`

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:
- `start` will be the maximum `v` encountered when `t == 1`, which is 20.
- `end` will be the minimum `v` encountered when `t == 2`, which is 50.
- `num` will be a list of all `v` encountered when `t == 3`, which is `[100, 200]`.

Output State: **start = 20, end = 50, num = [100, 200]**
