The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has more than one element, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, and `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements, and `x` should be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list `a`**
