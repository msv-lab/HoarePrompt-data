The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `k` is 1, after executing the line `k = i`, the value of `k` will be updated to whatever the value of `i` is. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `best`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is at least 3, `k` is `i`, `best` is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received, `res` is the input string, and `res` equals '<'.**
