The code appends the character at position `[i][j-1]` from the 2D list `xx` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n` and `j` is also `n`. Therefore, the character at position `[n][n-1]` in `xx` is appended to `nx`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string concatenated with `xx[n][n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`.**
