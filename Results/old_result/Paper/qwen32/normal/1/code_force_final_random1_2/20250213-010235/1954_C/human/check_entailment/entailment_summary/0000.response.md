### Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the product of two numbers by strategically swapping their corresponding digits. The approach taken by the program is to iterate through the digits of the two numbers and construct two new numbers: one with the maximum possible digits at each position and another with the minimum possible digits at each position.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program reads two numbers `x` and `y` and converts them into lists of integers.
2. **Comparison and Assignment**:
   - It initializes two empty lists `new` and `new2` to store the resulting digits.
   - It iterates through the digits of `x` and `y` simultaneously.
   - For each pair of digits, it assigns the maximum digit to `new` and the minimum digit to `new2`.
   - This process continues until a mismatch is found between the digits of `x` and `y`.
3. **Handling Mismatches**:
   - Upon finding a mismatch, it assigns the maximum digit to `new` and the minimum digit to `new2` for that position.
   - After this point, it reverses the assignment for the remaining digits, ensuring that `new` gets the minimum digit and `new2` gets the maximum digit.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the two new numbers formed.

This strategy ensures that the digits are optimally distributed between the two numbers to maximize their product. The logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to maximize the product of the two numbers by strategically swapping their digits.

**Correctness: True**
