The code snippet updates the `nums` variable by reading a new line of input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 500; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1.**
