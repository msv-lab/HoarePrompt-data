The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is '>'
- If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is 0, `x` is 2, `b` is `-i`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `l` is not less than `r`, then `b` is `b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- If `r` is 0, then `l` is 0.

Since the code only modifies `l`, we increment its value by 1. The exact value of `l` before the increment is not specified, so we denote its new value as `l + 1`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is '>', `l` is `l + 1`, and the conditions involving `l` and `r` remain as specified.**
