The given code snippet appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This means that whatever the previous value of `nx` was, it now includes an additional 'S' at the end.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nx`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `n` must be at least 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `nx` now includes an additional 'S' at the end.**
