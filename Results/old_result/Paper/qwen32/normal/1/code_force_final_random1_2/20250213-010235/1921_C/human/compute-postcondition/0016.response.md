To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined by the `for` loop statement:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1
- `f` is the second element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input
- `i` is 2

Since `i` is currently 2, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 according to the `range(1, n)` construct, making `i` equal to 3.

None of the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) are part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 3**
