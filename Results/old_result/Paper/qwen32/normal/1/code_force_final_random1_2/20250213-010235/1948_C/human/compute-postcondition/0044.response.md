Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. The current index `i` satisfies either `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
