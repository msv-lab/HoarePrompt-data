Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the health of the monster at `sorted_indices[pos]` is now `0` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was originally `0`. `x` is unchanged; `k` is greater than 0; `n` is unchanged; `sorted_indices` is unchanged; `distance` is 1; `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` and has been incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was `0`. `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` (before the decrement) and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` (before the decrement) if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was `0`. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not necessarily `0`.**
