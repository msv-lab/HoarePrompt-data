Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `len(a) == 2`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is the sorted version of `s` in descending order. If `b` equals `s`, the string `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, the string `s` is not sorted in ascending order.**
