The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. The value of `tem` is calculated as `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, and `i` is initially set to `len(arr) - 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`.
- `tem` is `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

After executing `ans.append(tem)`, the list `ans` now contains two elements: the original `arr[i]` and the newly appended `tem`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]` and `tem`; `tem` is `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`; `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.**
