### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the ribbon as a string of '0's and '1's.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' in the reversed ribbon, which corresponds to the index of the last '1' in the original ribbon. Since the ribbon is reversed, we need to subtract this index from `n-1` to get the actual index in the original ribbon. However, the code does not do this subtraction, which is a mistake.

3. **Extracting the Relevant Substring:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This is intended to extract the substring from the first chip to the last chip. However, due to the incorrect calculation of `y`, this substring might not be correct.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the substring `z`. The idea is that the number of operations required to move all chips into a contiguous block is equal to the number of free cells within the range of the first and last chips.

### Issues in the Code:
- The calculation of `y` is incorrect. It should be `n - 1 - y` to get the correct index of the last chip.
- The substring `z` might not be correctly defined due to the incorrect value of `y`.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        y = n - 1 - y  # Correct the index of the last chip
        
        z = arr[x:y+1]  # Extract the substring from the first to the last chip inclusive
        
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original code, it is not correct. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: False**
