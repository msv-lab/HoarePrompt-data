The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken the value `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1, but since the loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`, once `i` equals `n`, the next increment would make `i` equal to `n + 1`, which would cause the loop to terminate.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to `n` if it hasn't reached `n + 1` yet. However, since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, and assuming the loop is still valid to run, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n`, the loop cannot execute another iteration because `i` would then be `n + 1`, which is out of the range.

However, if we consider the state right before the loop condition fails, `i` should be `n` and the loop is about to terminate. But if we strictly follow the instruction to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we acknowledge that there isn't a "next iteration" possible.

For the sake of adhering to the format and providing the state just before termination:

State: **`nx` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, `i` is `n`** 

If we hypothetically consider the state right before the next iteration (which doesn't exist), it would be:

State: **`nx` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, `i` is `n + 1`** 

But since the loop terminates at this point, the correct state to represent is when `i` is `n` and the loop is about to terminate. Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`nx` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, `i` is `n`**
