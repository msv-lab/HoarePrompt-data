The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input.**
