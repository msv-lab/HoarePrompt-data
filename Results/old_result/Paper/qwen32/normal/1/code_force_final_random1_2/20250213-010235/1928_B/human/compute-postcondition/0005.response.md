To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `arr`, and the implicit length of `arr`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
- The loop starts with `i` initialized to `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `-1` (exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`.
- `tem` is `arr[i]`.

Since the loop iterates from the last element of `arr` to the first, we need to adjust `i` to point to the next element in the reverse order.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was pointing to some element in `arr`.
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.

2. **Adjust other variables:**
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is the list being iterated over.
   - `ans` and `tem` are dependent on the value of `arr[i]` but are not directly part of the loop head, so they do not need adjustment here.

### Example Calculation:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2 (meaning `arr` had at least 3 elements), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

### General Case:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

### Final State:
Given that `i` was `len(arr) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(arr) - 2`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`; `tem` is `arr[i]`; `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**
