Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and `count` is the total number of transitions in the string `s`. If `flag` is True, `count` is decreased by 1 indicating that there is at least one '01' transition in the string `s`. If `flag` is False, `count` remains unchanged.**
