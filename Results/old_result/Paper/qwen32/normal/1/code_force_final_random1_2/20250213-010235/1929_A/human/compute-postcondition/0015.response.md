Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `ntest` is greater than 0.
- `itest` is incremented by 1 (`itest = itest + 1`).
- `n` is a new integer value read from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Explanation:
- `a` is described as a sorted list of integers.
- Since `a` is sorted, `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list.
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element in the list because `len(a) - 1` gives the index of the last element in the list.
- The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

Given that the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the properties of the list.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`**
