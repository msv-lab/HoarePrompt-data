Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the string `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**
