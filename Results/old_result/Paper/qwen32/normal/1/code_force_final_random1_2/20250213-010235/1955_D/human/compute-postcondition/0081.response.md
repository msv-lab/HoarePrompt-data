The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it takes the next value from the iterable `b_values` during each iteration. Given that `cnt_b[i]` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration, this indicates that `i` was used as a key in the dictionary `cnt_b` and its count was reset or initialized to `0`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `b_values` must still have additional elements to iterate over. The variable `i` should be updated to the next value in `b_values`.

Let's assume that `b_values` is an iterable like a list or a tuple, and it has more elements beyond the current `i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element after the current `i`; `i` is the next value in `b_values`; `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.** 

However, since `i` is being updated to the next value in `b_values`, we should specify that `i` is now the subsequent element. Let's denote this next element as `next_i`.

State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element after the current `i`; `i` is `next_i`, where `next_i` is the next value in `b_values`; `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.**

Since we don't have specific values, we'll just denote the next value generically.

State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element after the current `i`; `i` is the next value in `b_values`; `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.**
