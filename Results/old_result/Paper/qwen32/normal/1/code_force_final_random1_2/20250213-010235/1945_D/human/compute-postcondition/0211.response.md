Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `custos` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- Variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(c)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is trying to print the variable `c`. However, there is no mention of the variable `c` in the initial state. This means that the variable `c` is either not defined or not mentioned in the given context.

Since `c` is not defined or described in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the code would result in a `NameError` if executed, because Python does not recognize `c`.

However, since the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given information and the format specified, we should acknowledge that the variable `c` is not defined.

### Conclusion:
Given that `c` is not defined in the initial state, the code would raise an error. But adhering to the task's format, we describe the situation as follows:

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
