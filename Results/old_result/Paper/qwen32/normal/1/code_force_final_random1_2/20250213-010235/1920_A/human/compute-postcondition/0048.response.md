The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables; it only influences the flow of control within loops by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables `start`, `end`, or `num`.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 20, `end` is 50, `num` is [100, 200]**
