The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, or `k`. The only change is that `l` is now assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]], `sm` is updated based on the given conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is `int(b[0])`, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
