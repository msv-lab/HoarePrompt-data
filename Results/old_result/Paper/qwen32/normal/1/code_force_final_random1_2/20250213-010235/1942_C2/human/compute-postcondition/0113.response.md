Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `y` and `tmp` are unchanged unless the condition `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1` is true, in which case `y` is reduced by `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` includes the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to include `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**
