In this task, the loop head contains only one variable, `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will continue to execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Since the loop iterates `t` times, at the end of each iteration, the internal counter (which is not directly accessible via `_`) would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, this counter would already reflect the increment.

However, since `_` is not used within the loop body, its value does not affect the loop's execution. The loop will continue to run until the internal counter reaches `t`.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is the internal counter, which is implicitly managed by the `range(t)` function. For the loop to execute one more time, the internal counter should be one less than `t` at the start of the iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4** (Note: The state of `t` itself does not change; it is the internal counter of the loop that changes, but since `_` is not used, we do not need to explicitly state it.)

To be precise in terms of the loop's internal state:
- The internal counter (not directly accessible) would be one less than `t` at the start of the next iteration.

But adhering strictly to the requirement of only adjusting the objects in the loop head, and since `_` does not hold any state that affects the loop continuation, the state remains as:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4**
