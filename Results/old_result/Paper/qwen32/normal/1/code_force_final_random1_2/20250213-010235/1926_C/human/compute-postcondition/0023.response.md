The code modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding `pd[i - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `t + 2`, which means `pd[t + 2]` is updated to `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1]`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` remains an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` remains 200001.
- `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`. After the operation, `pd[t + 2]` is updated.
- `i` remains `t + 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t` except `pd[t + 2]` which is now `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1]`, `i` is `t + 2`.**
