The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `n` is at least 4, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 5, it will execute again if `n + 1` is greater than 5, meaning `n` must be at least 5.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 6.

State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and is at least 5, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]` and `a[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0 and `pf[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, `mp` is `{0: [4], data[4]: [5]}`, `i` is 6**
