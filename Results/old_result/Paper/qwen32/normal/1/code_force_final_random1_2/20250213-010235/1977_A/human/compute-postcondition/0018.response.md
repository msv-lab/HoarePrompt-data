Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, implying `i` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even (or both).
- At least one of `m` or `n` is even.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output will always be `'No'`.

### Output:
Output: **No**
