The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer input. The values of `t`, `l`, `lis`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
