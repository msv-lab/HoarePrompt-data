The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Given that `tem` is equal to `arr[i]` and `ans` initially contains `arr[i]` and `tem`, after appending `tem` again, `ans` will now contain `arr[i]`, `tem`, and `tem` (which is `arr[i]`). Therefore, `ans` will have three elements, all of which are `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]`, `tem`, and `tem`; `tem` is `arr[i]`.**
