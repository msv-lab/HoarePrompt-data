The given code snippet sets the variable `curr` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `a`, `cnt_b`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input; `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of the original `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now `m` for `b[i]` (previously `m-1`); `i` is `m-1`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `n`, `m`, `k` are the input integers; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
