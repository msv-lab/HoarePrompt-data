You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `x` is 5, `y` is 1, `cnt` is 6.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` as input, then calculates and prints the count of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are positive integers, `gcd(x, y) = 1`, and the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t is 0; result is t * (t + 1) // 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then executes `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value explicitly, but the annotations suggest that the final state involves a calculation related to the sum of the first `t` natural numbers (`t * (t + 1) // 2`).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`. However, the current implementation does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition properly.

2. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in `func_1` are not correctly set up to cover all pairs `(a, b)`. Specifically, the loops are iterating over `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This does not ensure that all pairs `(a, b)` within the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]` are checked.

3. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic inside the loop is also incorrect. The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`. It seems to be attempting to count pairs based on a specific relationship between `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, but this is not aligned with the problem's requirement to check all pairs `(a, b)` directly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` or `m` is very small, the program might miss valid pairs due to the incorrect loop conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]` and check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the required condition, ensuring that all potential cases are handled correctly.
