To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 1.
   - `res`: The input string.
   - `best`: Updated to the current index `i` (from 2 to n-1) if `res` is '<'. Otherwise, it remains 0.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration (starting from 2 to n-1).
   - `k`: Not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is defined elsewhere in the code and has some value.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)`.
   - This statement will print a question mark (`?`), followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, the value of `i`, and then flush the output buffer.

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `k`: Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. We will denote it as `k`.
   - `best`: This depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `<`, `best` will be set to the current index `i` (from 2 to n-1). Otherwise, `best` remains 0.
   - `i`: This is the current index in the loop, starting from 2 up to `n-1`.

Given these points, the output will depend on the specific values of `k`, `best`, and `i` at the time the print statement is executed. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [i] (where k is the value of k, best is the value of best, and i is the current index from 2 to n-1)**
