The given code snippet only contains the line `ans += 1`. This means that the value of `ans` is incremented by 1. None of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `b_values`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `curr`) are modified by this line.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `ans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `i` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `cnt_b` remains unchanged, `curr` remains unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
