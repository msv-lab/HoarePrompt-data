The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given context, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables (`data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`) are modified by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is t - 1, `idx` is 2*n + 3 + 2*q + 4, `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being `'YES'`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n + 1 elements where the element at index i (for i from 1 to n) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of n + 1 elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` equals 0.**
