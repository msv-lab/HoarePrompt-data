The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1.

Given the initial state, if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is already being tracked. After executing the code, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will be reduced by 1.

Therefore, the updated value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` will be its previous value minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless `a[i]` was in `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` was greater than or equal to 0, which would affect `curr` in subsequent code (not shown here).

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`, with the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is 0; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0.**
