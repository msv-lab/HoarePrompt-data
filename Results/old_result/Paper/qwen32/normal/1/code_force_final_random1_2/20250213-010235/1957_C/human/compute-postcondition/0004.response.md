The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from 3 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value between 3 and `n-1` (since the loop is about to execute again). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop condition is `for i in range(3, n + 1)`, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration, provided `x + 1` is still within the range `[3, n]`.

Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `n` at the start of the next iteration.

Since we are not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should simply be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is incremented by 1**  
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is now `i + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express the state as `i` being incremented by 1:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to be precise and match the format of the previous examples, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can just say `i` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `i + 1`**

For clarity, if we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is 4**

But generally:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `i + 1`**
