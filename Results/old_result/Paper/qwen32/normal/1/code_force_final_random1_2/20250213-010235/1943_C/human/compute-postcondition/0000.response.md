The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from its initial state to the integer value provided by the user. The other variables (`u2vs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, `n` is the integer input by the user, and the function assumes that the tree is connected and undirected.**
