To determine the new value of `a` after executing the given code snippet, let's break down the calculation:

Given:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `i` is `1`
- `a` is `A[l - 1]` where `l` is a valid index for `A`.

Let's assume `l` is a specific valid index for `A`. Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `l`, we will consider each possible value of `l` (from 1 to 4) to see how `a` changes.

### Case 1: `l = 1`
- `a = A[1 - 1] = A[0] = 0`
- `a = a + (i - idx_A[1 - 1]) * 1 = 0 + (1 - 3) * 1 = 0 - 2 = -2`

### Case 2: `l = 2`
- `a = A[2 - 1] = A[1] = 2`
- `a = a + (i - idx_A[2 - 1]) * 2 = 2 + (1 - 5) * 2 = 2 - 8 = -6`

### Case 3: `l = 3`
- `a = A[3 - 1] = A[2] = 4`
- `a = a + (i - idx_A[3 - 1]) * 3 = 4 + (1 - 6) * 3 = 4 - 15 = -11`

### Case 4: `l = 4`
- `a = A[4 - 1] = A[3] = 7`
- `a = a + (i - idx_A[4 - 1]) * 4 = 7 + (1 - 7) * 4 = 7 - 24 = -17`

Since `l` is not specified, we cannot determine a single specific value for `a`. However, we can express the possible values of `a` based on the different possible values of `l`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is either -2, -6, -11, or -17 depending on the value of `l`.**
