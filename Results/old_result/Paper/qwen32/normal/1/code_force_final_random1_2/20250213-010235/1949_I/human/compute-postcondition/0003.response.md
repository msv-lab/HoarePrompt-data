The code snippet reassigns `r` to be a new list of `None` values with length `n`. This means the original list `r` which contained the radii of the disks is replaced by a new list filled with `None`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**
