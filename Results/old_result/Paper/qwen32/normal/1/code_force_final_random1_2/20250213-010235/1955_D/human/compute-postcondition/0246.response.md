Output State: **`a` remains the same, `i` is the next element of `b_values`, `cnt_b` has the element `i` set to 0, `curr` reflects the final count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values` must have at least one element, `b` remains unchanged.**

Natural Language: The value of `cnt_b[i]` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, including `a`, `i`, `curr`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values`, and `b`.
