Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is `i + 1` (However, `i` is not initialized before this operation, so it seems there might be a missing initialization step. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume `i` is initialized to some value before this operation).
- `n` is the first integer read from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` without referencing any variables, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
