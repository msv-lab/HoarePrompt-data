The given Python code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Here's the breakdown of the output state:

- `data` remains a list of strings representing the input values.
- `t` remains `t + 1`.
- `idx` remains `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4 + n`.
- `results` remains a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`.
- `q` remains a value greater than 0.
- `a` remains a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `pf` remains a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
- `mp` remains a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs.
- `l` remains the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `r` is now assigned the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**
