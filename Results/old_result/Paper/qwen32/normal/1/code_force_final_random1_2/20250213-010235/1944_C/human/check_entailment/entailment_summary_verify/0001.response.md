To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to array `c` (Alice starts first).
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) and a main loop that reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case. The key function here is `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: To determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`.
  - Iterates through numbers starting from 0, checking if both the current number (`start`) and the next consecutive number (`start + 1`) are available.
  - Adds these numbers to a set `vis` and decrements their counts in the `nums` counter.
  - Stops when a number cannot be consecutively added and prints `start + 1` as the MEX.

### Function Summary Recap
- The function `func_1` processes the list to find the smallest integer `k` such that the integers from `0` to `k` are present in the list in a specific pattern and prints `k + 1`. If the pattern breaks, it prints the current value of `k` and terminates.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Statement
The key point to consider is whether the provided code correctly simulates the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of `c`.

#### Optimal Strategies
- **Alice's Strategy**: She should aim to maximize the MEX by adding numbers that extend the sequence of consecutive numbers in `c`.
- **Bob's Strategy**: He should aim to minimize the MEX by preventing Alice from extending the sequence of consecutive numbers.

#### Code Logic
- The code iteratively checks for the presence of consecutive numbers starting from 0. If both `start` and `start + 1` are available, it simulates adding them to `c` by updating the `vis` set and decrementing counts in `nums`.
- When a number cannot be consecutively added, the code correctly identifies this as the point where the MEX is achieved.

### Correctness Check
- The logic of checking for consecutive numbers and updating the counts aligns with the optimal strategies described.
- The MEX calculation is correctly implemented by identifying the smallest number that cannot be consecutively added.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly simulates the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob and accurately calculates the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
