To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `b_values`, which means the state of `b_values` is crucial.

Given the loop:
```
for i in b_values:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `b_values` contains at least one element.
- The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `b_values` during each iteration.
- The initial state provided is `t`, which is not related to the loop's execution condition.

### Required Adjustments:
- `b_values` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts since it will be assigned the first element of `b_values` during the first iteration.

### Final State:
Since `t` is not relevant to the loop's execution, we only need to adjust `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, etc.)**
