The given code modifies the variable `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). This operation ensures that `sm` remains within a specific range, which is often used in programming contests to prevent integer overflow.

Given the initial state:
- `suf` is a list of cumulative sums including 0.
- `smin` is a list where each element is the minimum between the corresponding element in `suf` and the previous element in `smin`.
- `sm` is initially set to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\), and it is guaranteed to be non-negative.

After executing the line `sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, the value of `sm` is updated to be the remainder when `sm` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the other variables (`suf`, `smin`) are not modified by this line of code, they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]], `sm` is (2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)**.
