The given code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `lst` was previously defined as a list that could either contain `i + 1` under certain conditions or remain empty, this operation modifies `lst` by adding `i + 1` to it regardless of those conditions.

Here's the updated state:

- `mini` remains 100000000.
- `final` remains a list containing `n`.
- `c1` remains `o * 100 // n`.
- `t` remains decremented by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `s` remains the input string.
- `pk` remains `n / 2`.
- `sl` remains a list of characters from the string `s`.
- `o` remains the count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `z` remains the count of '0's in the string `s`.
- `lst` now contains `i + 1` appended to it.
- `zero` remains incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `one` remains incremented by 1.
- `zero_perc` remains `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- `one_perc` remains `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- `i` remains incremented by 1.

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is a list containing `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `lst` contains `i + 1` appended to it, `zero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
