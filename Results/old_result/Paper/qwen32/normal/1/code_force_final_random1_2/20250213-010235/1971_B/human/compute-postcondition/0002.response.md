The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means the previous value of `s` (which was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters) is replaced by the newly input string. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0.**
