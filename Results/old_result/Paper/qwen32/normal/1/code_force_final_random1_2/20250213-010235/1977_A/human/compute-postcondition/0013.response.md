The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes various conditions related to the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and will always output the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer read from input within the range 1 to 100.
- `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, implying a loop that runs `t` times.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with specific constraints: `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and both `m` and `n` are even.

However, none of these conditions influence the `print('Yes')` statement directly. The statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
