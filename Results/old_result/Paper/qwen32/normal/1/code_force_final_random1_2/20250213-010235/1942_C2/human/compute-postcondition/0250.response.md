Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list includes the new element `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` list includes the new element `gap`.**
