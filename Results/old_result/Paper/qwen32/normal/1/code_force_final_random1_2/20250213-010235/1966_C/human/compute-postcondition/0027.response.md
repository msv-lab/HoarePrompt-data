To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `tc`: Must be at least 2 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `arr`: A new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end. It must have at least 3 elements.
   - `dp`: A boolean value determined by the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`. Here, `dp` is initially evaluated based on this condition.
   - `n`: Length of `arr` minus 1 (`len(arr) - 1`), and since `arr` has at least 3 elements, `n` is at least 2.
   - `i`: Set to `n-1`.

2. **Key focus on the `dp` variable:**
   - The value of `dp` is set based on the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`. 
   - Since `dp` is used in a boolean context, its initial value is implicitly `False` unless otherwise specified. Therefore, the condition simplifies to checking if `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` because `not False` is `True`, and the `or` operator short-circuits to the left operand if it is `True`.

3. **Determining the output:**
   - The `print` statement outputs `'Alice'` if `dp` is `True`, otherwise it outputs `'Bob'`.
   - The value of `dp` depends on the difference between the two largest elements in `arr` (since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[n-2]` and `arr[n-1]` are the second and third largest elements respectively).

4. **Final analysis:**
   - If `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1`, then `dp` is `True`, and the output will be `'Alice'`.
   - Otherwise, `dp` is `False`, and the output will be `'Bob'`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will depend on the specific values in `arr`. However, based on the provided information, we can describe the output precisely:

Output: **'Alice' if the difference between the second and third largest elements in `arr` is greater than 1, otherwise 'Bob'**.
