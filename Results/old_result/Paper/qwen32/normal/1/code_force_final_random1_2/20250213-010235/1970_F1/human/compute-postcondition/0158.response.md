To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the logic involved in the print statement.

### Key Variables and Conditions:

1. **`time`**: This variable represents the current time in the simulation. It is calculated as `current_time + 1`.
2. **`team`**: This variable is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`, which likely checks the position `pos` of the object `obj` to see if it is in a goal area. The function returns an integer indicating the team that scored the goal (e.g., 0 for red team, 1 for blue team).
3. **`GoalName`**: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to their respective names. For example, `GoalName[0]` might be "RED" and `GoalName[1]` might be "BLUE".

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

This statement formats and prints the current time (`time`) followed by the name of the team that scored the goal (`GoalName[team]`), and appends "GOAL" to indicate that a goal has been scored.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Determine `time`**:
   - `time` is calculated as `current_time + 1`. Since `current_time` is not explicitly provided, we can denote it as `t`. Therefore, `time` will be `t + 1`.

2. **Determine `team`**:
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`. This function checks the position `pos` of the object `obj` to determine which team's goal area it is in. The exact value of `team` depends on the position `pos` and the layout of the goals in the grid.

3. **Determine `GoalName[team]`**:
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary mapping team identifiers to their names. For instance, `GoalName[0]` could be "RED" and `GoalName[1]` could be "BLUE". The exact name printed will depend on the value of `team`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the current time incremented by 1, followed by the name of the team that scored the goal, and the word "GOAL".

### Final Output:

Output: **(t + 1) [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where t is the current time, team is the result of goalIn(pos), and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that scored the goal)**
