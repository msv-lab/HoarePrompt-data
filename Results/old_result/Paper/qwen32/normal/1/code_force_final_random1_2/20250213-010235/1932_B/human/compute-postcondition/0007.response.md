The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust `ai` to the next element in the list `a` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer
- `year` is `a[0]`

At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` would have taken the value of the current element being processed in the list `a`. To proceed to the next iteration, `ai` should be updated to the next element in the list.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `ai` was `a[k]` for some index `k`. For the next iteration, `ai` should be `a[k+1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can generalize that `ai` should be the next element in the list `a` after the current `ai`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `year` is `a[0]`, `ai` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `ai`**.

To be more specific, if `ai` was `a[k]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `ai` should be `a[k+1]`. However, without knowing the exact `k`, we can just say `ai` is the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `year` is `a[0]`, `ai` is the next element in the list `a`**.
