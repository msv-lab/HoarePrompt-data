Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" is processed. The first two characters `h` of `s` are converted to a 12-hour format, and "AM" or "PM" is appended based on whether the original hour is less than 12 or not. After all `t` iterations, all test cases have been processed and their corresponding outputs (in 12-hour format with AM/PM) have been printed.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished processing all `t` test cases, converting each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with the appropriate AM or PM suffix, and printing the result for each case.
