To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_2` does. Since the definition of `func_2` is not provided, we can only infer that `func_2` returns three values which are assigned to `s`, `m`, and `ops`. 

Given that `a` is a list of integers and `n` is an integer provided by the input, and without further details about `func_2`, we can only say that `s`, `m`, and `ops` will take on whatever values `func_2` returns.

Since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot provide specific values for `s`, `m`, and `ops`. However, we can state that these variables will be assigned the respective return values from `func_2`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2`, `ops` is the third return value of `func_2`.**
