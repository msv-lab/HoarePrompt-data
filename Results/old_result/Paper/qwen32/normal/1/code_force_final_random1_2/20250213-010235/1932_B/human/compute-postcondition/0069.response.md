Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000), and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). The function returns a list `results`, where each element is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding test case's list.**
