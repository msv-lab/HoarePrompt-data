To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `n` must be greater than 1 (this variable is the upper bound of the loop and does not need adjustment for the next iteration).
- `x` is a list of integers (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `i` is now `i + 1`**.

However, to be more precise, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_k + 1`.

If `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is 4**.

Generalizing this, if `i` was `i_k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_k + 1`.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

But to be specific about the next iteration value:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

If we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is 4**.
