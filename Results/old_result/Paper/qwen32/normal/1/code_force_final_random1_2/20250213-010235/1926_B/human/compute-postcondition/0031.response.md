The code appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. 

Given the initial state, if `b` contains the character '1', `k` will have an additional element which is the count of '1' in `b`. If `b` does not contain the character '1', no new element is added to `k` because `b.count('1')` would return 0, and appending 0 might not be the intended behavior if the precondition specifies that `k` only gets an additional element when '1' is present.

Since the problem specifies that `k` has an additional element only if `b` contains '1', we assume that the count is non-zero and should be appended.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer; `b` is a string representing that positive integer; `k` has an additional element which is the count of '1' in `b`.**
