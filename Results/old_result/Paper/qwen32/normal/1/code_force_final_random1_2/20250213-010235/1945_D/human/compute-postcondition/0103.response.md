The only variables in the loop head are `v` and `na_frente`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `na_frente` must be at least 0 because the loop iterates from `na_frente` down to `-1`. The variable `v` is initialized to `na_frente` at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust it directly; instead, we ensure that `na_frente` is set appropriately.

Given the initial state, `na_frente` is defined as "the first integer from the input minus 1". To ensure the loop executes, this value must be at least 0. Therefore, the first integer from the input must be at least 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1 (so `na_frente` is at least 0), `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is 1000000000000**
