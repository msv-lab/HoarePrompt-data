To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `n` is the integer value provided by the input.
- `s` and `m` are the first and second return values of `func_2`, respectively.
- `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples.
- `(l, r)` is the next tuple to be processed from `ops`.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement specifically outputs `l + 1` and `r + 1`. To understand what will be printed, we need to know the current values of `l` and `r`.

From the initial state, we know that `(l, r)` is the next tuple to be processed from `ops`. This means that `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of one of the tuples in the `ops` list, respectively.

### Example Scenario:
Let's assume `ops` contains the following tuples: `[(1, 3), (4, 6), (7, 9)]`. If `(l, r)` is the next tuple to be processed, it could be any of these tuples depending on the current position in the processing sequence.

For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `(l, r)` is currently `(1, 3)`.

### Calculation:
- `l` is 1.
- `r` is 3.
- Therefore, `l + 1` is `1 + 1 = 2`.
- And `r + 1` is `3 + 1 = 4`.

### Output:
Based on the above calculations, the `print` statement will output `2, 4`.

However, since the exact tuple `(l, r)` is not specified in the initial state, we should provide a general answer based on the structure of the problem.

### General Output:
The `print` statement will output the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the elements of the next tuple to be processed from the `ops` list.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where (l, r) is the next tuple to be processed from the ops list)**
