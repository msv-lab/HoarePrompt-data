Let's analyze the provided Python code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a grid of size 5x3.
- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of screens (grids) required to fit all icons.

### Key Observations:
1. **Grid Capacity**: A 5x3 grid has 15 cells.
2. **2x2 Icons Placement**: 
   - Each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells.
   - Placing 2x2 icons optimally can fill up the grid efficiently.
3. **1x1 Icons Placement**:
   - After placing 2x2 icons, the remaining cells can be filled with 1x1 icons.
   - If there are leftover cells after placing 2x2 icons, they can be used for 1x1 icons.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `a` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, we read `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens (`z`)**:
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required to place `y` 2x2 icons. The formula `(y + 1) // 2` ensures that we round up since each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons.
   
3. **Calculating Remaining Cells (`m`)**:
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculates the total number of cells available after placing `y` 2x2 icons across `z` screens. If `y` 2x2 icons are placed, they occupy `y * 4` cells, so the remaining cells are `15 * z - y * 4`.
   
4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `if m < a`: This condition seems incorrect. It should check if there are enough remaining cells to accommodate `x` 1x1 icons.
   - `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`: This adjusts the number of screens if there aren't enough remaining cells for `x` 1x1 icons.

### Issues in the Code:
- The condition `if m < a` is incorrect. It should check if `m < x` to see if there are enough remaining cells for `x` 1x1 icons.
- The logic for adjusting `z` when there are not enough remaining cells is flawed.

### Corrected Logic:
1. Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons: `z = (y + 1) // 2`.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `m = 15 * z - y * 4`.
3. Check if there are enough remaining cells for 1x1 icons: `if m < x`.
4. If not, calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons: `z += (x - m + 14) // 15`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
