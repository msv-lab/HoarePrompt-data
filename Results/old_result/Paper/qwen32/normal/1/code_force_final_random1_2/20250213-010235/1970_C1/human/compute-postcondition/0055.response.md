Postcondition: **`queue` has one more element `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged. `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors. `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple. `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including the previous `neighbor` if it was not in `visited`; otherwise, `visited` remains unchanged. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now included in `visited`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.**
