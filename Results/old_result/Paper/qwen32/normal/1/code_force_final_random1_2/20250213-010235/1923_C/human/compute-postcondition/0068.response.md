The code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `j` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` equals 1 or not. After appending `j` to `c`, the list `c` will now have three elements: `[0, j, j]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers obtained from the input.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements.
- `p` remains `[0, i, 2 * x]`.
- `c` is now `[0, j, j]`.
- `i` remains `x + x`.
- `j` remains 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains 1.
- `a` and `b` remain integers obtained from the input in the last iteration.
- `s` remains `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is [0, i, 2 * x]; `c` is [0, j, j]; `i` is `x` + `x`; `j` is 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
