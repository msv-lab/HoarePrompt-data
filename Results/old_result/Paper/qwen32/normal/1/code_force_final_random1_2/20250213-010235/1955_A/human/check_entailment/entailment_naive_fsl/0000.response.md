Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.
- Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2*a`), it would be cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `(n//2) * b + a`.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n` is 1, the program should simply return `a` because buying one yogurt individually is the only option.
- When `b >= 2*a`, the program should always buy yogurts individually.
- When `b < 2*a`, the program should buy as many pairs as possible and handle the remaining yogurt(s) appropriately.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9` (buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price)
   - Expected: `9`
   
2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14` (buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `14`
   
3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15` (buy 3 yogurts individually)
   - Expected: `15`
   
4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20` (buy 4 yogurts individually)
   - Expected: `20`

5. **Additional Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 5 9`
   - Output: `5` (buy 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `5`
   
6. **Additional Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 8`
   - Output: `20` (buy 2 pairs and 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `20`
   
7. **Additional Case 3:**
   - Input: `6 5 8`
   - Output: `24` (buy 3 pairs)
   - Expected: `24`

### Conclusion:
The program handles the provided examples and additional edge cases correctly. It considers both scenarios where buying in pairs is beneficial and where buying individually is necessary. There are no apparent issues with the logic or implementation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering whether it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs, and it handles both even and odd values of `n` appropriately.
