To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while num != 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is not equal to 0. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is that `num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^4\), no adjustment is needed to ensure that `num` remains non-zero for another iteration. The variable `a`, which is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`, does not affect the loop condition and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`**
