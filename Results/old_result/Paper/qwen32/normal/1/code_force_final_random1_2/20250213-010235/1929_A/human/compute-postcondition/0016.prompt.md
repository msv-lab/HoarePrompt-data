Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an input integer; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` must be greater than 0; for each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is greater than 0; `itest` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is the integer value read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is greater than 0; `itest` is `itest + 1`; `n` is the new integer value read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
