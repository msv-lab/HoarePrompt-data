The code snippet provided is `ans += ss`. This line appends the character stored in the variable `ss` to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state, `ans` is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the operation, we can infer that `ans` is likely a string that will accumulate characters.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers read from the input.
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `ss` remains the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` remains the integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet.
- The condition regarding `cur` and `cnt` is not affected by this line of code, so `cur` remains 0 and `cnt` remains unchanged.

The only change is that `ans` now includes the character `ss` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is unchanged; `ans` is a string that includes the character `ss` appended to it.**
