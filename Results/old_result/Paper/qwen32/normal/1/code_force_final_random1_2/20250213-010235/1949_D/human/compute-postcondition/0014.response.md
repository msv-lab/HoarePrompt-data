Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, where `b[i]` is 1 for all `i` except `b[j]` which is 2 if the character at position `j-1` in `x` is 'S', otherwise `b[i]` remains 1 for all `i`, `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string, and `x` is a string read from the input, with the character at position `j-1` in `x` not being 'F'.**
