Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `stop` is `True` if `a[i]` is less than 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged, `opNum` is `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `opNum` is now set to the value of `a[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `stop` remain as described in the initial state.
