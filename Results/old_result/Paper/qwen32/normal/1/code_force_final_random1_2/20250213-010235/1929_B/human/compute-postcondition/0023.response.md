To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is the next line from the input file.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `s`:**
   - `s` is a string that contains two integers separated by whitespace. This string is read from the input file.
   
2. **Variables `n` and `k`:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting the string `s` into parts and converting them to integers.
   - For example, if `s` is `"10 15"`, then `n` would be `10` and `k` would be `15`.

3. **Expression `math.ceil(k / 2)`:**
   - `k / 2` computes the division of `k` by `2`.
   - `math.ceil()` rounds up the result of the division to the nearest integer.

### Output:
The output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Example:
- If `k` is `5`, then `k / 2` is `2.5`, and `math.ceil(2.5)` is `3`.
- If `k` is `6`, then `k / 2` is `3.0`, and `math.ceil(3.0)` is `3`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the ceiling value of `k / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is one of the integers obtained from splitting the string s)**
