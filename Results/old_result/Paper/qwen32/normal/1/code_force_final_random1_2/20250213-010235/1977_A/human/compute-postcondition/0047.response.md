Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` and `m` are integers read from input. If `m == n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged regardless of whether `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` is true or false.**
