Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`. If `xx[n][n-1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is concatenated with `xx[n][n-1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), 'F' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.**
