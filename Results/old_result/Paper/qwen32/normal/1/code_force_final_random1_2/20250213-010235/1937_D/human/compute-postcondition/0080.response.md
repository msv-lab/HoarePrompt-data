To determine the new value of `b` after executing the line `b = b - A[l - r - 1]`, we need to consider the current values of `b`, `A`, `l`, and `r`.

Given:
- `b` is initially `7`.
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`.
- `l - r > 0` indicates that `l - r - 1` is a valid index for the list `A`.
- Since `l - r > 0`, `l - r - 1` will be a non-negative integer less than the length of `A` (which is 4).

Let's denote `l - r - 1` as `index`. The value of `b` will be updated to `b - A[index]`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `b` in terms of `l` and `r`. However, we know the possible values of `A[index]` based on the possible values of `index`.

The possible values for `index` are `0, 1, 2, 3` because `A` has 4 elements.

Thus, the possible new values of `b` are:
- If `index` is `0`, `b` becomes `7 - A[0] = 7 - 0 = 7`.
- If `index` is `1`, `b` becomes `7 - A[1] = 7 - 2 = 5`.
- If `index` is `2`, `b` becomes `7 - A[2] = 7 - 4 = 3`.
- If `index` is `3`, `b` becomes `7 - A[3] = 7 - 7 = 0`.

Therefore, the new value of `b` depends on the specific values of `l` and `r`, but it will be one of these possible values.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`; `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`; `l` is not less than `r`; `r` is not equal to `0`; `n` is greater than `0`; `s[i]` is `'>'`; `l - r > 0`; `a` is `6 - 4 * i`; `b` is `7 - A[l - r - 1]`.**
