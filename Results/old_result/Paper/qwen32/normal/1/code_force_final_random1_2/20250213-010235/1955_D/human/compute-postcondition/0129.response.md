The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Based on the initial state, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement. Since the code only increments `curr` and does not affect other variables, we need to update the value of `curr` and determine the new value of `ans`.

Given that `curr` is incremented by 1, the new value of `ans` will be 1 if the new value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` will be 0.

Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `m`; `m` and `k` remain unchanged; `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `i` is `m`; `b_values` remains unchanged; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0; `ans` is 1 if the new value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
