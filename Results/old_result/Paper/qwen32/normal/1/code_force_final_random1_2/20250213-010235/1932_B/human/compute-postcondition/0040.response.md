Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where the first two tuples have non-empty lists as their second elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and is a non-empty list, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `ai` is `a[j+1]`, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `next_year` is updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. All other variables retain their initial values.
