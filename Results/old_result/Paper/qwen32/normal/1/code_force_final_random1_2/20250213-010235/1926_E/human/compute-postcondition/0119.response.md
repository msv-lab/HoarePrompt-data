To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 * k - 1)` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `d` is initialized to `n`.
- `p` is initialized to 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `h` is initialized to `n`.
- `y` is not defined.
- `f` is not defined.
- `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

From the above, the only relevant variable for the print statement is `k`. The expression `2 * k - 1` will be evaluated based on the value of `k`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

The expression `2 * k - 1` computes an odd number that is directly related to the value of `k`. For example:
- If `k` is 1, then `2 * 1 - 1` equals 1.
- If `k` is 2, then `2 * 2 - 1` equals 3.
- If `k` is 3, then `2 * 3 - 1` equals 5.

Thus, the output will be an odd number determined by the value of `k`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2)**
