Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1 and now `tc` is `tc - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp` after the last iteration, `n` is len(arr) - 1, and `i` is n-1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1 (since it was at least 2 initially), `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1` where `len(arr) > 2`, and `i` is `n-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 0, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `True` if no consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `n-1`) have a difference of 1 or less; otherwise, `dp` is `False`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2), `i` is `n-1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
