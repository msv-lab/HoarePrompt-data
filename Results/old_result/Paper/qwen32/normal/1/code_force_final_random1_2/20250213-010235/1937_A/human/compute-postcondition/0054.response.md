Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is calculated as \(\log_2(t)\).
- `power` is also calculated as \(\log_2(t)\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- `power` is defined as \(\log_2(t)\). This means `power` is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to get `t`.
- Therefore, \(2^{\text{power}}\) should give us back the original value of `t`.

### Conclusion:
The expression `2 ** power` will evaluate to `t` because `power` is the logarithm base 2 of `t`.

### Output:
Output: **t (where t is the original integer value given in the initial state)**
