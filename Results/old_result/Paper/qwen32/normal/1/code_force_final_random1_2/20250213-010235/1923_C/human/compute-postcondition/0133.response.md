The `print('NO')` statement in the provided Python code snippet is straightforward. It does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `s`) and their relationships, but none of these variables influence the `print('NO')` statement.
- The `print('NO')` statement is a direct instruction to output the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
