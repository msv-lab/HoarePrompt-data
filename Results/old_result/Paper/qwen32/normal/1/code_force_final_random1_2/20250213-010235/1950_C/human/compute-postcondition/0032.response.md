Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. For each test case, it returns a value indicating whether the time is during the day or night. Specifically, if the time is between 06:00 and 17:59 inclusive, it returns "day"; otherwise, it returns "night".**
