Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is 0; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'NO'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`); `impossible` is `True`, indicating that there was no pair of consecutive characters in either the first row or the last row that were different.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `ans` is set to `'NO'`. All other variables retain their initial values.
