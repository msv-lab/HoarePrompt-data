Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[4]` mapped to `(2, 4)`, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, and `ind` is 4. If `line[4]` is a player, the state remains unchanged. If `line[4]` is not a player and `line[4][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is set to 0 if `line[4][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(2, 4)`.**
