To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables or the state of the program. However, based on the given format and instructions, we can assume that `func_1()` might modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables.

Since the function `func_1()` is not defined, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where `func_1()` does not modify `t` and introduces a new variable `result` which is set to `t * 2`.

Hypothetical Code for `func_1()`:
```python
def func_1():
    global t
    result = t * 2
```

Given this hypothetical scenario, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4; `result` is `t * 2`.**

If `func_1()` does something different, please provide the function definition, and I can adjust the output state accordingly.
