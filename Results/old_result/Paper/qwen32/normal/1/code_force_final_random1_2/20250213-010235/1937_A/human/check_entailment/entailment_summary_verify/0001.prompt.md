You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine the final position of the element `1` in the array after performing a series of swaps. Each swap involves finding the largest proper divisor of the current index and swapping the elements at that divisor's index with the current index.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State**: The array starts with `a_i = i` for all `i`.
2. **Swap Operation**: For each `i` from `2` to `n`, we find the largest proper divisor `d` of `i` and swap `a_d` and `a_i`.
3. **Position of `1`**: We need to track where `1` ends up after all swaps.

### Pattern Recognition:
- When `n` is a power of `2`, the position of `1` stabilizes at `2^k` where `k` is the highest power such that `2^k <= n`.
- When `n` is not a power of `2`, the position of `1` is at `2^(floor(log2(n)))`.

### Explanation of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Handling Special Case (`n = 1`)**: If `n = 1`, the array remains `[1]`, so the position of `1` is `1`.
3. **General Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - It calculates `log2(n)` to determine the highest power of `2` less than or equal to `n`.
   - It then finds the highest integer `power` such that `2^power <= n`.
   - If `2^power` equals `n`, it prints `2^power`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `2^(power - 1)`.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`
  - `log2(4) = 2`, `power = 2`, `2^power = 4`
  - Output: `4` (Correct)
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`
  - `log2(5) ~ 2.32`, `power = 2`, `2^power = 4`
  - Output: `4` (Correct)
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 120240229`
  - `log2(120240229) ~ 26.84`, `power = 26`, `2^power = 67108864`
  - Output: `67108864` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the final position of `1` in the array after performing the specified swaps. It handles both special and general cases appropriately.
