Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_next`; `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`); `c` is `i_next // 2`; `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c` and then increased by `y * 2`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `val`, `i`, `y`, `c`, and `sx` remain as described, with `y` being adjusted by subtracting the previous value of `c` (`i_current // 2`) and `c` updated to `i_next // 2`. `sx` is recalculated using these new values and then further increased by `y * 2`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
