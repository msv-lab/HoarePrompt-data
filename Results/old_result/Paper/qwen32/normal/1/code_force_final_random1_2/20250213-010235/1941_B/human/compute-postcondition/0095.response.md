The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is `a[i]` and `a[i]` is currently 0, `2 * opNum` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `opNum` is `a[i]` (which is 0), `stop` remains False unless `a[i]` is less than 0, `i` remains unchanged.**
