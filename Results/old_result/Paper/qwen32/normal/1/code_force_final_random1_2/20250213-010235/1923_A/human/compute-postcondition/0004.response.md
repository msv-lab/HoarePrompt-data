The code snippet `x = arr.find('1')` searches for the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr` and assigns its index to the variable `x`. Given that the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1, the string `arr` (formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed) will definitely contain the character '1'. Therefore, `x` will be assigned the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, and the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1; `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.**
