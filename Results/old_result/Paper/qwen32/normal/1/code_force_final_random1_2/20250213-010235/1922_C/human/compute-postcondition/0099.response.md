To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with keys from 2 to `n`, updated based on certain conditions within a loop.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with a default integer value of 0, and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on certain conditions within a loop.
   - `m`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `j`: Set to `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y`: Two integers read from the input, where `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d2`:**
   - `d2` is a dictionary with default integer values of 0.
   - The values of `d2` from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` are updated based on some conditions inside a loop, but the specific conditions are not provided here.
   - Therefore, without knowing the exact updates to `d2` within the loop, we can only describe the output in terms of the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

3. **Analyzing the print statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` calculates the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.
   - Since `y` is less than or equal to `x`, and `d2` is initialized with default values of 0, the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` depend on how they were updated within the loop.

Given the lack of specific details about the updates to `d2` within the loop, the best we can do is describe the output in terms of the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`:

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values in the defaultdict d2 at keys y and x respectively)**
