To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the operations described in the precondition.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` after the loop.
- `mex` is the minimum value encountered during the loop.

### Key Points:
1. **`mex` Calculation**: `mex` is described as the minimum value encountered during the loop. However, the exact loop and how `mex` is updated are not provided in the initial state. Given the context, it's reasonable to infer that `mex` is likely the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `ar` after processing the loop.
2. **`res` List Construction**: Each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.

### Output Analysis:
The print statement `print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))` will output the elements of the list `res` as a space-separated string.

Given the information:
- `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `ar` after the loop.

Without the exact values of `ar` and the loop logic, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `res`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the elements of the list `res` as a space-separated string, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `ar` after the loop.

Output: **res (where each res[i] is mex - ar[i] and mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in ar after the loop)**
