The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial state mentions that `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the provided code does not affect `i` and instead reassigns `A`, `B`, and `C` based on the new input.

Since the code reads new values for `A`, `B`, and `C`, these variables will now hold the newly input values. The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the new input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
