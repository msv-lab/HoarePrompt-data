### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to move chips in such a way that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The number of operations required is equal to the number of free cells (0s) between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read the array and remove spaces
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip)
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' from the end (rightmost chip)
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Slice the array from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s). For each test case, it calculates the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of the integer 1 in the list and prints this count.

#### Analysis:
1. **Finding Indices**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This correctly finds the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' from the end, which corresponds to the rightmost chip. However, this index is relative to the reversed array, so the actual index in the original array is `n - y - 1`.

2. **Slicing**:
   - The slicing `z = arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. The correct slicing should be `arr[x:n - y - 1 + 1]`, which simplifies to `arr[x:n - y]`. However, since `y` is the distance from the end, the correct slicing should be `arr[x:n - y]` but considering the correct interpretation, it should be `arr[x:n - y + 1]` to include the rightmost chip.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's in the sliced portion, which is indeed the number of operations needed if the slicing is correct.

#### Corrected Slicing:
The correct slicing should be:
```python
z = arr[x:n - y + 1]
```
This ensures that the rightmost chip is included in the slice.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify with the first example:
- Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- `x = 1` (first '1')
- `y = 1` (first '1' from the end, which is at index 6 in the original array, so `n - y - 1 = 8 - 1 - 1 = 6`)
- Correct slicing: `arr[1:7]` which is `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- Number of '0's: `1`

The program as written does not correctly handle the slicing due to the off-by-one error.

### Conclusion:
Given the off-by-one error in the slicing, the original program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required.

**Final:** **False**
