Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` else `False`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2), `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. The values of `t`, `tc`, `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
