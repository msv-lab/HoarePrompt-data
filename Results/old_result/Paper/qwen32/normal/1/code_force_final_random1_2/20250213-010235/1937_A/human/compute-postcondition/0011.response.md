The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `power` is 2, so after the increment, `power` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the original value of `n` must be greater than 4, `n` is log2(original value of n) and must be greater than 2, `power` is 3**.
