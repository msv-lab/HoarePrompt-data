To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True`, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `L` is an empty list

We need to ensure that `n` is not zero. Since `n` is described as "the first integer read from the input," we need to specify that this integer should be non-zero.

No other variables (`t`, `k`, or `L`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the modified state to ensure the loop executes at least once is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list**.
