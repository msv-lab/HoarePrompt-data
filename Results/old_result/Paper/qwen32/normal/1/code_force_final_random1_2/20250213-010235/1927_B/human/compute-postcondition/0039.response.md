To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the operations step-by-step:

1. **`rev_array[j:]`**: This slices the `rev_array` starting from index `j` to the end of the list.
2. **`.count(rev_array[j])`**: This counts the occurrences of the element at index `j` in the sliced list `rev_array[j:]`.
3. **`- 1`**: This subtracts 1 from the count obtained in the previous step.
4. **`alp[...]`**: This accesses the character in the `alp` list (which contains the English alphabet) at the index determined by the previous calculation.
5. **`ans.append(...)`**: This appends the character obtained from the `alp` list to the `ans` list.

Given these steps, the `ans` list will now contain three elements: the original two elements plus the newly appended character.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `ans` is now a list containing three elements: the original two elements plus the newly appended character from the `alp` list.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged from the initial state description).
- `array` remains unchanged.
- `alp` remains unchanged.
- `rev_array` remains unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1 (unchanged from the initial state description).
- `l` must still be greater than `j`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing three elements (original two elements plus the newly appended character from `alp`), `i` is incremented by 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is a list of the English alphabet characters, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` must be greater than `j`.**
