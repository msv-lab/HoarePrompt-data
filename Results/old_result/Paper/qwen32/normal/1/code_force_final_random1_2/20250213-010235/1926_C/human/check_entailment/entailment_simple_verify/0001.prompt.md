You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive).

2. **Sum of Digits Calculation:**
   - For each integer `i` in the range, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1`.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to the cumulative `sum`.
   - This cumulative `sum` is appended to the list `A`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a number `num` and calculates the sum of its digits.
   - It does so by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0.

4. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - After precomputing the cumulative sums of the digits for numbers from 1 to 200,000, the program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the value at index `n-1` in the list `A`.

### Evaluation:

- **Precomputation:**
  - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of the digits for all numbers up to 200,000. This is efficient because it ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time by simply looking up the precomputed value in the list `A`.
  - The maximum value of `n` is 200,000, so this precomputation covers all possible values of `n`.

- **Correctness of Precomputation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any given number.
  - The cumulative sums stored in `A` are correct because they are computed by adding the sum of digits of each number sequentially.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - Since the precomputation is done once before processing any test cases, the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases efficiently within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly precomputes the required cumulative sums and handles multiple test cases efficiently. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness:** **True**
