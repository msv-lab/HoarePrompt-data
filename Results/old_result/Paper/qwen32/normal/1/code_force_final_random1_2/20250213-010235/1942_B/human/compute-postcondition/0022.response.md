The code snippet provided updates the list `ar` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The variables `t`, `n`, `res`, and `mex` remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop, with `mex` being updated during the loop; `mex` is the minimum value encountered during the loop.**
