Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `i` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `j` is incremented by 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'. Otherwise, `b[i]` is incremented by 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
