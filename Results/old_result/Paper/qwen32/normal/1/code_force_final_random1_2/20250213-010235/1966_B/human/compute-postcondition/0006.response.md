The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it was `i-1` before being incremented), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, if `i` was `i-1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i`.

So, if `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, after the first iteration, `i` would be 1, and so on. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `x`, we can just say `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Simplified Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`**.
