To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the expression step by step based on the initial state provided:

### Given Information:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0 (exact value not specified, but it's a positive integer)
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is `2`
- `r` is decreased by 1 (this does not affect the print statement directly)

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Identify the variables involved in the expression:**
   - `n`: A positive integer (value not specified)
   - `i`: Given as `2`
   - `idx_A`: List `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
   - `l`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the given information, so we need to infer its value. Since `idx_A[l - 1]` is used, `l` must be an index such that `l - 1` is within the bounds of `idx_A`.

2. **Assume `l` is a valid index:**
   - Let's assume `l` is `3` (a common assumption for demonstration purposes). This means `l - 1` is `2`, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[2]`, which is `6`.

3. **Substitute the values into the expression:**
   - `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`
   - Substituting `i = 2` and `idx_A[l - 1] = 6`:
     - `n - 2 + (2 - 6) * 2`
     - Simplify inside the parentheses first: `2 - 6 = -4`
     - Multiply by 2: `-4 * 2 = -8`
     - Final expression: `n - 2 - 8 = n - 10`

### Conclusion:
The expression evaluates to `n - 10`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n - 10 (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
