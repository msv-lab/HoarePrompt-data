Postcondition: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `len(final) != 0`, then `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
