Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` at the current index `i`, then `i` is added to `sa`. `sb` is a list containing indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
