To determine what will be printed by the `print('Alice')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is another newly input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from a new split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
- `j` is incremented by 1 (`j = j + 1`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('Alice')` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, or `j` are used within this specific `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
