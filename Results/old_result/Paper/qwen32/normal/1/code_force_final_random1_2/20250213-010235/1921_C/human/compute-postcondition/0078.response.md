The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. Therefore, `b` now holds the value of `feat[-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is a variable, `array2` is a list of integers, `n` is `feat[0]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `feat[2]`.**
