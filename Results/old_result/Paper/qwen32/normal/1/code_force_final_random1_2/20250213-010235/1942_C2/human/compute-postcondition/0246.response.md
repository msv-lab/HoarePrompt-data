Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `next_elem` remain as per their definitions in the initial state.
