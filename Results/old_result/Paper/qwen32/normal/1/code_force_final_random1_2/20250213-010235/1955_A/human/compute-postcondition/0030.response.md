Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on specific conditions involving these integers. The input consists of an integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) lines, each containing three integers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). The output is a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the calculated result.**
