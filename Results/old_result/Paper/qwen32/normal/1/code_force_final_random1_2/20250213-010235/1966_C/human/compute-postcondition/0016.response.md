The given code snippet is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, this new value of `n` will overwrite the existing `n` which was previously defined as `len(arr) - 1`.

Given the initial state, `n` was initially set to `len(arr) - 1`. After executing the code snippet, `n` will take on the new value provided by the user input.

Since the other variables (`t`, `tc`, `arr`, `dp`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp` after the last iteration, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, and `i` is `n-1` (based on the old value of `n`).**
