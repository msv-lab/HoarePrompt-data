The code snippet `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that the `visited` set will now include the `neighbor` if it was not already present.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set. The `queue`, `current`, `dist`, and `neighbor` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` has one more element if the previous `neighbor` was not in `visited`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged. `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors. `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple. `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including the previous `neighbor` if it was not in `visited`; otherwise, `visited` remains unchanged, and now includes the `neighbor`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`.**
