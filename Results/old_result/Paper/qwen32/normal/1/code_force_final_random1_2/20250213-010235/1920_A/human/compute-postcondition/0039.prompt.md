Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is [], `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is the second integer from the input, `t` can be either 1, 2, or 3, `start` is -1 if `t` is 3 or if `t` is 1 and `start` is not updated (i.e., `start` is less than `v`), otherwise `start` is updated to `v`. `end` is 1000000000.0 if `t` is 3 or if `t` is 2 and `end` is not updated (i.e., `end` is greater than `v`), otherwise `end` is updated to `v`. `num` is `[v]` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains `[]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` is not equal to 1, none of these changes occur except `num` is now `[v]` or `[v, v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; if `t == 2`, `end` is `v` if `end > v`, otherwise `end` remains unchanged; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
