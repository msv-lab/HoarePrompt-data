Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the previous `y` and the integer value of the current `y`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is 0, `y` is the next element in `a`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `a_values` now includes the integer value of the current `y` in addition to the integer value of the previous `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
