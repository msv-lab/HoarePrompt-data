The code snippet assigns the values from the current test case in `test_cases` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. Given that `_` is incremented by 1 before this line, `_` now points to the next test case in the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`; `_` is incremented by 1 for each test case; `_` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from the current test case in `test_cases`.**
