Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 3; `array2` now includes the element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.**

In natural language: The value of `array2` has been updated to include a new element, which is calculated as `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
