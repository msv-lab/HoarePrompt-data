Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first and second lines of each test case contain strings of length `n` consisting only of '<' and '>' characters; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: the loop completes all iterations without breaking, and it prints "Yes".

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is incremented by the number of iterations, and the loop prints "Yes".

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is 1, n is an input integer, a is an input string, b is an input string. The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, so the output is "Yes".




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
