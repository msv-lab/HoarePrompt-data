The given code snippet reads a new input line, removes all whitespace from it, and assigns the resulting string to `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `x`, `y`, or `z` directly. However, since `arr` is reassigned, `x`, `y`, and `z` may need to be recalculated based on the new value of `arr`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t < 1000.
- `n` is the new integer input by the user.
- The list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1.
- `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.

After executing the code snippet, `arr` will be updated to a new string with all whitespace removed. Since the new `arr` is derived from the input, the indices `x` and `y` will need to be recalculated based on this new string. Consequently, `z` will also need to be recalculated.

However, the problem statement does not specify that `x`, `y`, and `z` should be recalculated, so we assume they remain as per the original `arr` unless explicitly recalculated in subsequent code (which is not provided here).

Therefore, the only change is to `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t < 1000, `n` is the new integer input by the user, the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1, `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the new input line with all whitespace removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.**
