The `print('NO')` statement will output the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `n` and `k` since these variables are not used in the print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, and `n` is currently 0. However, these values do not affect the print statement.
2. The print statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
