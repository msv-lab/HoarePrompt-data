Postcondition: **`ind` contains exactly one index of a cow with a rating greater than `x`, `c` is 1, and `i` is the last index checked (potentially `n-1`). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. The current value of `ind[0]` is 0. If `k` is equal to 14, the specific actions or changes associated with `k` being 14 are executed, but since there is no else part, no other changes occur if `k` is not equal to 14.**
