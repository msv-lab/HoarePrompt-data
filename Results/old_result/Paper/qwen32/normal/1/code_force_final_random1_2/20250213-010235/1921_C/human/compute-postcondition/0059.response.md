The given Python code snippet appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this result to `array2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers
- `i` is 1
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is an empty list
- `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`

After executing the code `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`, the value of `array2` changes as follows:
- `array2` now contains one element, which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list containing one element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**
