The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the initial values of `n` and `m` are overwritten by the new values provided through the input.

Given the initial state, `n` and `m` were already defined, but now they are reassigned based on the input. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `gr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged unless they are affected by subsequent code (which is not shown here).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
