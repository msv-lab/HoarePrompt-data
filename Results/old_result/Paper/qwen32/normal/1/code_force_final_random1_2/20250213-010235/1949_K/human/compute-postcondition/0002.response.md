Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of integers, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
