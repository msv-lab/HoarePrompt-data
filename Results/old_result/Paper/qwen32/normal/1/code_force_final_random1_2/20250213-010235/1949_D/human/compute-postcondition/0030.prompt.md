Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0, `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string, `x` is a string read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, where the element at index `i` is 1 and the element at index `j` is 1 if the character at position `j-1` in `x` is 'F', otherwise all elements are 0, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0 except `b[i]` which is 1 for all `i` and `b[j]` which is 2 if the character at position `j-1` in `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string, and `x` is a string read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` has been incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise all elements have been incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where `b[j]` is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S' (since it was already incremented by 1 in the initial state), `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string, and `x` is a string read from the input. `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` has been incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise it has been incremented by 1; `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where `b[j]` is incremented by 3 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', otherwise it is incremented by 1; `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string; `x` is a string read from the input; `j` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
