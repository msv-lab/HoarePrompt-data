The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. This means that `bd` now has one more element compared to its previous state.

Given the initial state, `bd` was defined as a list with at least `i + 2` elements, starting with `0` and `b[1] - b[0]`. After executing the line `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])`, `bd` will have an additional element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input; `b` is a list with at least `i + 2` elements where `b[0]` is `0` and `b[1]` is an integer; `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`; `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[i] - b[i - 1]]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
