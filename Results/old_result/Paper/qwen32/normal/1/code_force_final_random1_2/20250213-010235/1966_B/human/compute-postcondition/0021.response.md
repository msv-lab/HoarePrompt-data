The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the current value of `j` plus 1.

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since the loop condition is `j in range(m - 1)`, `j` must be less than `m - 1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the new value of `j` must still satisfy this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). `j` is incremented by 1. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`.**

Let's assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). `j` is `k + 1`. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`.**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). `j` is incremented by 1. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`.**

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). `j` is `j + 1`. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`.**

To simplify, assuming `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). `j` is `k + 1`. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`.**

Since we don't know `k`, we can just say `j` is incremented by 1:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). `j` is incremented by 1.**

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). `j` is `j + 1`.**
