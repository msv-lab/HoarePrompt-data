The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given that `mex` was initially described as "the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations," this description is no longer accurate after the assignment, as `mex` is now explicitly set to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` `None` values, and `mex` is `n`.**
