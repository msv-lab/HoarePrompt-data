The code snippet `suf.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `suf`. 

Given the initial state, `suf` was initially an empty list `[]`. After appending `0`, `suf` becomes `[0]`.

The other variables (`smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0]`, `smin` is `[0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]]`, `sm` is updated based on the given conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is `int(b[0])`, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
