Postcondition: **`p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is now the integer that was originally at index `k-1`, and the element at index `k-1` is now the integer that was originally the first element of `s`; `ans1` reflects the count of valid conditions met during the loop; `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was encountered, otherwise `z` is 0; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `h` is the first element of `s`; `j` is 1; `s` must have at least two elements; `i` is `s[2]`. If `h < i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
