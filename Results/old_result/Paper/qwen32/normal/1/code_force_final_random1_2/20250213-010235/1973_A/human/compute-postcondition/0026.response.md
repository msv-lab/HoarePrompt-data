Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed), `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**
