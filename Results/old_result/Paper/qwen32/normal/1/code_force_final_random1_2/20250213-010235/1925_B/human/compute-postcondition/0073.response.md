Output State: **`x` is an integer that must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such divisor exists, `q` is `q + 1`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The values of `x`, `n`, `d`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans`.
