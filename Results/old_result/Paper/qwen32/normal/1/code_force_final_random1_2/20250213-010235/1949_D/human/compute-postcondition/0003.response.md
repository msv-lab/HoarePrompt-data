The code snippet only initializes a new list `xx` with a single element, which is an empty string. This does not affect the values of `n`, the input matrix, or the lists `a` and `b`. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for `n`, the input matrix, `a`, and `b`, except for the new list `xx`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. It is guaranteed that the input matrix is symmetric (i.e., the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line), and there are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters in the input. `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0. `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0. `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string.**
