The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` equals 1. Therefore, `lst` will now contain the value 1.

The other variables remain unchanged by this operation. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` must be at least 2; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 0 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is 1; `lst` is `[1]`; `mini` is `100000000`; `i` is 0; `zero_perc` is 100 if the first character of `s` is '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 0; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50**.
