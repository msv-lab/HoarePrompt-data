The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases or lines of data that will follow. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**
