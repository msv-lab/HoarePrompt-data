### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Code Analysis:

**Function `func_1`:**
- This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\) for a given pair of integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- It iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1, checking if the conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are satisfied.
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) * x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) * y} \right\rfloor\).

However, there are several issues with this approach:
- The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly checked in the code.
- The logic for counting pairs seems flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

**Function `func_2`:**
- This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not properly checked, and the counting logic appears incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
