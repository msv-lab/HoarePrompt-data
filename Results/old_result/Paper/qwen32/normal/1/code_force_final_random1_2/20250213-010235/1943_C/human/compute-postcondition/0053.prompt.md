Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b`, ending with the start node `0`; the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b`, ending with the start node `0`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b` with an odd length, `ops` includes the new tuple `(c, i)`, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b` with an odd length, `ops` includes the new tuple `(c, i)` and the previously existing elements, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
