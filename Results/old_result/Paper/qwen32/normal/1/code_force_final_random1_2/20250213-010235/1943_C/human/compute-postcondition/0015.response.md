The given code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them into `u` and `v`, and converts them to integers. This means that the values of `u` and `v` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n+1` lists.
- The list at index `u` contains the value `u`, the original value `v`, and the newly appended value `v`.
- The list at index `v` now contains `[v, v, u]`.
- `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1.
- `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.
- `n` is increased by 1.

After executing the code snippet, `u` and `v` will be reassigned to the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n+1` lists, where the list at index `u` contains the value `u`, the original value `v`, and the newly appended value `v`; the list at index `v` now contains `[v, v, u]`; `u` is the first integer from the new input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the new input minus 1; `n` is increased by 1.**
