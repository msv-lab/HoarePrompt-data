Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors in the shortest path from node `0` to `b` with an odd length, `ops` includes the new tuple `(c, i)` and the previously existing elements, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `c` is the value at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the `ops` list now includes the new tuple `(c, i)` in addition to any tuples it may have contained before. All other variables retain their initial values.
