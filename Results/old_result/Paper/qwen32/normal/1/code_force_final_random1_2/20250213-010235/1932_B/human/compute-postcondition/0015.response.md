The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `a`.

The variables `year`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`year` is the final accumulated value after processing all elements in `a` according to the loop logic; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the input integer from the user; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the user input.**
