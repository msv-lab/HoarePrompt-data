Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the current iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the current iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`. After the if-else block, `a` and `b` are updated to the values obtained from the input. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the current input in the form `map(int, input().split())`; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions remain as specified in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
