To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each set of inputs `(A, B, C)` and how these inputs affect the outputs based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is provided as input.
- For each iteration, three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` are read.
- Depending on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, one of the following actions is performed:
  - If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
  - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
  - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, it calculates `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`.

### Final Output State:
After all `n` iterations, the loop will have processed `n` sets of `(A, B, C)` and printed the corresponding results based on the above conditions. The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` (from the initial state) remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will have reached the value `n` after the loop completes.

### Conclusion:
The final output state consists of the printed results for each of the `n` iterations, with the initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remaining unchanged.

Output State: **The loop has processed `n` sets of `(A, B, C)` and printed the corresponding results based on the conditions provided. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state includes the printed outputs for each iteration along with the unchanged initial variables.
