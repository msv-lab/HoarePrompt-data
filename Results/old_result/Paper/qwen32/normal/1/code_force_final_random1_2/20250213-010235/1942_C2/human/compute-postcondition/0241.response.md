The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. No other variables are modified in terms of their values, only the list `even` is updated.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i + 1 == x - 1` else `a[i + 2]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `even` contains the new element `gap`.**
