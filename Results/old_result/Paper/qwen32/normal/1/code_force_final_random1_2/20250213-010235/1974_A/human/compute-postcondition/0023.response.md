To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates `a` times, where `a` is a given input integer. For each iteration, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads two integers `x` and `y`.
2. Computes `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`.
3. Computes `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`.
4. Checks if `m` is less than `a`. If true, updates `z` to `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.
5. Prints the value of `z`.

### Final Output State

After all `a` iterations, the state of the variables will be as follows:
- The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged.
- The variable `a` (number of iterations) remains unchanged.
- The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last iteration.
- The variable `z` will hold the value computed in the last iteration.
- The variable `m` will hold the value computed in the last iteration.

### Output State Description

The final output state after all iterations will be characterized by the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `m` from the last iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.

### Final Answer

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer representing the number of iterations, `x` and `y` are the integers from the last iteration, `z` is the value computed in the last iteration as `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15` if `m < a`, otherwise `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is the value computed in the last iteration as `15 * z - y * 4`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` and `a` remain the same, while `x`, `y`, `z`, and `m` reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop.
