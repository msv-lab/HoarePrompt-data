The value of `k` is updated to `k - i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `k` becomes `k - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `k`. This means the value of `k` remains unchanged by the operation. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `c`, and `i`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice; `c` is 3; `i` is 1.**
