The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. However, since the loop condition is `j in range(1, n + 1)`, `j` cannot be `n + 1` because the upper bound in the range function is exclusive.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to the next value within the valid range, which is `1` if `j` was previously `n`.

However, since the problem specifies that we are at the end of the previous iteration where `j` is `n`, and typically in such scenarios, the loop would terminate after `j` reaches `n`, we need to consider the context of the loop's execution flow. Given that `j` is currently `n`, the loop will terminate after this iteration unless there's some external mechanism resetting `j` or other control flow changes not shown here.

For the sake of adhering strictly to the task and adjusting only the loop head variables, and assuming the loop is about to terminate but we need to show the state just before it does:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`**.

If we were to hypothetically reset `j` to start another cycle (which is not shown in the given code snippet), then:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `1`**.

But based on the provided information and typical loop behavior, the correct state right before termination is:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`**.
