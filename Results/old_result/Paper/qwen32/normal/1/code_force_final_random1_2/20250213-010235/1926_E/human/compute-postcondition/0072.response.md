The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `t`, `L`, `pow`, and `tot` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 8, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is the list of values calculated in each iteration, `pow` is 2^len(L), `tot` is sum(L)**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `L`, `pow`, and `tot` remain the same. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
