Given the code snippet `elements[obj] = nxt`, the value of `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. This means that the position of the object `obj` in the `elements` dictionary is now set to the new position `nxt`.

Let's summarize the changes and the remaining conditions:

- `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.
- All other variables retain their previous values unless they were directly affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, with `elements[obj]` now set to `nxt`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[0, 0]` unless specified otherwise, `t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`, `time` is `current_time + 1`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**
