The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` and the list `cas_de_test`. Therefore, we can only adjust these for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple.
- `total_points` is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.
- `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)`.
- Depending on certain conditions, `resultats` is set to `[-1]` or `[egalites // 2]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` needs to be extracted from `cas_de_test`. The value of `t` does not change as it represents the total number of test cases and is not directly related to the loop iteration. 

Let's denote the next tuple in `cas_de_test` as `(next_p1, next_p2, next_p3)`. After processing the current tuple, `cas_de_test` should now point to the remaining tuples, excluding the one just processed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed), `total_points` is `next_p1 + next_p2 + next_p3` from the new first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `3 * (next_p1 + next_p2 - next_p3)`, `resultats` is determined based on the new `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites`**.

Since we are only concerned with adjusting the state of the loop head, we focus on `(p1, p2, p3)` and `cas_de_test`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed), `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`**.
