The code appends a line of input to the list `gr`. This means that `gr` now contains one more element, which is the string read from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `tc` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input.**
