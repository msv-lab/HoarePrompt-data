Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, and the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2; `b` is the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order. If `b` is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order. Otherwise, `s` is not sorted in alphabetical order.**
