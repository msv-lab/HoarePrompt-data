In this case, the loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a common convention for a loop variable when its value is not used within the loop body. Since `_` does not influence the loop's continuation condition, we don't need to adjust its value. The loop will continue as long as `q` is greater than 0.

Given that the loop iterates `q` times, at the start of each iteration, the loop variable `_` does not hold any specific state that needs to be adjusted. However, since `q` determines how many times the loop will run, we need to ensure that `q` is decremented appropriately after each iteration to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

However, the problem specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and since the loop head only contains `_`, there is no state to adjust directly related to the loop head. Therefore, the state remains the same except for the implicit decrement of `q` which is managed by the loop control itself.

State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 4` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element is `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, the second-to-last element is `'YES'` if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4 - n]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 3 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
