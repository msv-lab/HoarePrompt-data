Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. It is guaranteed that the input matrix is symmetric (i.e., the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line), and there are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters in the input. `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0. `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, initialized to 0. `xx` is a list containing a single element, which is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` is the count of 'F's at position `j-1` in `x`; `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `j` is the count of 'S's at position `j-1` in `x`; `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`; `x` is a string read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where each element reflects the count of 'F' occurrences involving the respective index, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where each element reflects the count of 'S' occurrences involving the respective index, `xx` is a list containing three elements: an empty string, the string `x`, and the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, and `i` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of 'F's at position `j-1` in `x` plus one more if the last character in `x` was 'F', `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of 'S's at position `j-1` in `x` plus one more if the last character in `x` was 'S', `xx` is a list containing four elements: an empty string, the string `x`, the string `x`, and the string `x`, `x` is the newly input string, `j` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
