Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transitions for each scenario.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings representing the transition videos.

2. **Counting Transitions:**
   - For each scenario `i`, it iterates through all other scenarios `j`.
   - If the transition video between `i` and `j` is `F`, it increments `a[i]` and `a[j]`.
   - If the transition video between `i` and `j` is `S`, it increments `b[i]` and `b[j]`.

3. **Classifying Scenarios:**
   - It creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - If a scenario has at least one funny transition and no scary transitions, it is added to `sa`.
   - If a scenario has at least one scary transition and no funny transitions, it is added to `sb`.

4. **Deciding Remaining Transitions:**
   - If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, it adds all undecided scenarios to `sa`.
   - Otherwise, it adds all undecided scenarios to `sb`.
   - For each scenario `i`, it constructs a new string `nx`:
     - If the transition video between `i` and `j` is already decided (`F` or `S`), it keeps the decision.
     - If the transition video is undecided (`?`):
       - If `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4` elements of `sa` or `sb`, it assigns `F` or `S` accordingly.
       - Otherwise, it assigns the opposite type (`S` or `F`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed transition video plan.

### Issues and Corrections

- **Logic Flaw:** The logic for assigning `F` or `S` to undecided transitions is flawed. The program assigns `F` or `S` based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4` elements of `sa` or `sb`. This approach does not guarantee that no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type will occur for any permutation of scenarios.
- **Insufficient Constraints:** The program does not ensure that the final assignment of `F` and `S` adheres to the constraint of not having more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type. This is crucial for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle the core requirement of ensuring that no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
