Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is the count of that element in the first `m` elements of `b`, except the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1. `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` are integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1. The current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
