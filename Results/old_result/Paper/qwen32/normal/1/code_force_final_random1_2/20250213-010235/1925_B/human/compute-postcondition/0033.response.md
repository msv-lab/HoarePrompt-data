Postcondition: **`ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value. `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `x` is divisible by `i`.**
