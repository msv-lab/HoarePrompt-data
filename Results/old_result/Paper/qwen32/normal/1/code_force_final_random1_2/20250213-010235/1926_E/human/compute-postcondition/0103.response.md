The code snippet `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Given that `a` is `L[1]`, the new value of `tot` will be its previous value plus `L[1]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is 8
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is a list with at least two values
- `pow` is 4
- `tot` is initially `tot + a`, which means it already includes the value of `a` once
- `a` is `L[1]`
- The conditions `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` are mentioned, but they do not affect the execution of `tot += a` directly.

After executing `tot += a`, `tot` will be incremented by `a` again, making its new value `tot + a`.

Output State: **`t` is 8, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least two values, `pow` is 4, `tot` is `tot + 2*a`, `a` is `L[1]`.**
