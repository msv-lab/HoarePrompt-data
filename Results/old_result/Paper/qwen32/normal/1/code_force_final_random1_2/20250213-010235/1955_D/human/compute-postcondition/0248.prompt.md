Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `max_val` is 1000000; `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(m):
        cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
    b_values = set(b)
    ans = 0
    curr = 0
    for i in range(m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1
    for i in range(n - m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                curr -= 1
        if a[i + m] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
    for i in b_values:
        cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now 0 for every `i` in `b_values`, `i` is the last element of `b_values`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was `>= k` during the loop, `curr` is the count of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that are in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains the same, `i` is the last element of `b_values`, `cnt_b` has all elements corresponding to `b_values` set to 0, `curr` reflects the final count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
