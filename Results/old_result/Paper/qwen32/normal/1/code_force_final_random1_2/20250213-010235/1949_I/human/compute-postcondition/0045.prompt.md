You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1]. visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the `i-th` input, `y` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the `i-th` input, `r` is a list of integers with length `n` where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the `i-th` input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of integers with length `n` (values depend on `dfs` logic); `tot` is an integer (value depends on `dfs` logic); `bipartite` is a boolean (value depends on `dfs` logic); `ok` is `True` if any iteration found a bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`, otherwise `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is the input integer within the range 1 to 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of integers with length `n` (values depend on `dfs` logic); `tot` is an integer (value depends on `dfs` logic); `bipartite` is a boolean (value depends on `dfs` logic); `ok` is `True` if at least one iteration found a bipartite component with a non-zero `tot`, otherwise `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the given signature. However, it operates on global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. It performs some computation or traversal (possibly Depth-First Search (DFS)) using these variables. The function does not return any value directly but modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists based on the properties of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
