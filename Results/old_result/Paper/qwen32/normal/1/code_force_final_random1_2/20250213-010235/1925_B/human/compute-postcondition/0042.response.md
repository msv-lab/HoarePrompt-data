Postcondition: **`ans` is either the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, or retains its previous value otherwise. `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, `x` is divisible by `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.`**
