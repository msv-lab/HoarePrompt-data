The given line of code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. This affects the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` directly.

Given the initial state, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` was specifically set to `m-1` if `a[m-1]` is in `b_values`. After executing the line of code, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` will be reduced by 1.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of the original `a` except `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` is now `m-2` if `a[m-1]` is in `b_values`, `i` is `m`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` are the input integers, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, and `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**

In natural language: The count of the element `a[m-1]` in `cnt_b` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
