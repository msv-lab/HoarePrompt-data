The given code snippet only modifies the variable `j` by incrementing its value by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element
- `p` is [0, `i`, `i + x`]
- `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]
- `i` is `i + x`
- `j` is 1 if the previous `j` was 0 and `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`

The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`, `i + x`]; `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]; `i` is `i + x`; `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
