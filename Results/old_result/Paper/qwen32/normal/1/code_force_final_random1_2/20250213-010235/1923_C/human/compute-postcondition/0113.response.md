To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `x` from the `for x in l:` statement.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input;
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element;
- `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x]`;
- `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`;
- `i` is `x`;
- `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have taken the value of the current element from the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to take the value of the next element in the list `l`.

Let's denote the current value of `x` as `x_current`. The next value of `x` in the loop will be `x_next`, which is the next element in the list `l` after `x_current`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `l` or `x_current`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `x_next`; `j` is 1 if `x_next` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0**

Here, `x_next` represents the next element in the list `l` after the current `x`. The values of `p` and `i` are updated to `x_next`, and `j` is updated based on whether `x_next` is equal to 1.
