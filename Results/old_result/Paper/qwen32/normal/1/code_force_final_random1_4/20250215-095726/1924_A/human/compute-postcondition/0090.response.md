Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000. `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input. `cnt` is the total number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters. `tmp` remains an empty string. `i` remains 1. `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.**
