To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior.

The loop iterates over odd numbers from 1 to `n-1` (since the step is 2). For each iteration, it checks two conditions:
1. If `i + 1 < n` and both `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are `'<'`.
2. If `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `'<'`.

If either condition is met, the loop breaks and prints "No". If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints "Yes".

Given the initial state and the states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop has executed 3 times, meaning `n` must be at least 7 (since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from 1, the third iteration corresponds to `i = 5`).
- The conditions for breaking the loop were not met in the first three iterations.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `n` is such that the loop completes all iterations (i.e., `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 7), and none of the conditions for breaking the loop are met during these iterations, the loop will print "Yes" after finishing all iterations.
- If `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, the loop will still iterate over all odd numbers up to `n-1` (e.g., for `n=8`, the loop will iterate for `i=1` and `i=3` and `i=5`), and if none of the conditions for breaking the loop are met, it will print "Yes".

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `n` beyond it being greater than 1 and allowing at least three iterations, we assume the loop completes all intended iterations without breaking.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is decremented by 1, n is greater than 1, a and b are strings input by the user, and the loop prints "Yes".**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` is decremented by 1, `n` remains greater than 1, and the strings `a` and `b` remain as they were input by the user. The loop completes all iterations without breaking, so it prints "Yes".
