To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `a`: This is a list of integers obtained from the input. The length of this list is between 1 and 18, inclusive. Each element in the list is an integer between 0 and \(10^7\), inclusive.
- `n`: This is an input integer. However, it is not used directly in the provided code snippet.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops`: These are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`. The variable `ops` is specified to be a non-empty list of tuples.
- `(l, r)`: This is the next tuple in the `ops` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(l + 1, r + 1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement outputs the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`. Since `l` and `r` are elements of the tuple `(l, r)` from the `ops` list, their exact values depend on the return value of `func_2(a)`. 

However, we can describe the output in terms of `l` and `r`:
- `l + 1`: This is the first element of the tuple incremented by 1.
- `r + 1`: This is the second element of the tuple incremented by 1.

Given that `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples, we know that there is at least one tuple `(l, r)` to process. The specific values of `l` and `r` are determined by the implementation of `func_2(a)`, but they are part of the tuple returned by this function.

### Final Output Description:
The code prints the first and second elements of the tuple `(l, r)` from the `ops` list, each incremented by 1.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where (l, r) is the next tuple in the ops list returned by func_2(a))**
