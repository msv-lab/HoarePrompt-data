The code snippet provided updates the value of `lis` by creating a sorted list of unique integers from the map object `l`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
