The code snippet `d1[2] = 1` updates the defaultdict `d1` by setting the value associated with the key `2` to `1`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
