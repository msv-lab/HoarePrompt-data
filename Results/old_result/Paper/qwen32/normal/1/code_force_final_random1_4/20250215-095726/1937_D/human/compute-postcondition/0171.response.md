The code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` now holds the value stored at the index `l - 1` of the list `A`.

Given the initial state, no other variables are affected by this assignment. The string `s`, its length `n`, the lists `A` and `idx_A` containing computed values and indices of '>' characters, the lists `B` and `idx_B` containing computed values and indices of '<' characters, and the variables `i` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
