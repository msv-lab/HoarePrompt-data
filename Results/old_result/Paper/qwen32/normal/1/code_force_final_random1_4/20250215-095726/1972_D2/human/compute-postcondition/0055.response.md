The `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of the variable `cnt`.

Based on the initial state provided:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 5
- `cnt` is 2.5

The variable `cnt` has an explicit value of 2.5. Therefore, the print statement will output this value directly.

Output: **2.5**
