To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. These are the only variables used in the code snippet.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The expression inside the `print` function is `int(A * C / 2)`.
2. First, `A * C` is computed. This is the product of the integers `A` and `C`.
3. The result of `A * C` is then divided by `2`. Since this division is performed before the `int()` function is applied, it will yield a floating-point number if `A * C` is not divisible by `2`.
4. The `int()` function converts the result of the division into an integer, effectively performing a floor division (rounding down to the nearest whole number).

Given that `A` and `C` are integers, the output will be the integer part of the division of their product by `2`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **the integer part of (A * C) / 2 (where A and C are integers read from the input)**
