To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case.

Here's a breakdown of the loop:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each iteration, it reads a line of input containing four integers (`p_i`), which represent the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
3. It then creates a list `p` where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i`.
4. It calculates the output for each test case as follows:
   - It checks if the count of odd numbers in the first three elements of `p` is exactly 3. Since `p` contains only even numbers, this condition will always be `False`, so `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to `0`.
   - It adds to this result the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.
5. It prints the result for each test case.

Since the condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` is always `False` (because `p` contains only even numbers), the output for each test case simplifies to `sum(p) // 2`.

Given that `p` is derived by taking the largest even number less than or equal to each `p_i`, the sum of `p` is the sum of these even numbers, and dividing this sum by 2 gives the final output for each test case.

After processing all `t` test cases, the output state is simply the sequence of results for each test case printed one per line.

Thus, the final output state is the concatenation of the results of each test case, each on a new line.

Output State: **The output state is a sequence of integers, each representing the result of the computation for each test case, printed one per line.**
