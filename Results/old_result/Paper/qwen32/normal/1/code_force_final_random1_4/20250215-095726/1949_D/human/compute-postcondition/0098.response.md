To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions.
- `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions.
- `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings.
- `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list.
- `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

Since `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is `i + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

For simplicity and adhering strictly to the variables in the loop head, we can say:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

But to be more precise and include all relevant details:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

So the final answer is:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

However, focusing only on the variables in the loop head:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**. 

But to provide the most accurate state:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

So the final answer is:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.

But to simplify and focus on the loop head variables:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
