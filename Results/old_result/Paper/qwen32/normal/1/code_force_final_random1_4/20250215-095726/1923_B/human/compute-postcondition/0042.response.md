The code snippet updates the value of `delta` to be the minimum of `rest` and the element in `a` at the index specified by `sorted_indices[pos]`. Given the initial state, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` translates to `a[sorted_indices[2]]`, which is `a[2]` and equals `0`. Since `rest` is `8`, the minimum of `8` and `0` is `0`. Therefore, `delta` is updated to `0`.

Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `rest = 8`, `delta = 0`, `pos = 2`**
