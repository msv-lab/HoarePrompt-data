Postcondition: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` is `len(s) - 1`, `h` is equal to `s[0]`, and `i` is the element at position `len(s) - 1` in the list `s`. If `i` equals `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` (implying `h` is no longer equal to `s[0]`), otherwise `ans1` remains 0, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` does not equal `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` does not equal `h` and `z` is 0, `ans1` remains 0.**
