The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables directly; it just controls the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1
- `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2
- `num` is a list containing at least one element
- `i` is the next element in `num`

The `continue` statement does not alter the values of `start`, `end`, `num`, or `i`. It simply means that the current iteration of the loop will end early, and the next iteration will begin.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.
