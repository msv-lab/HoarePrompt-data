Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`; `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
