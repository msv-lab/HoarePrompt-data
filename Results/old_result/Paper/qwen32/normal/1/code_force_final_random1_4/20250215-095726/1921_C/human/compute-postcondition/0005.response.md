The code assigns the third element of the list `feat` to the variable `a`. Therefore, `a` now holds the value of `feat[2]`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `feat` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is the first element of `feat`; `f` is the second element of `feat`; `a` is the third element of `feat`.**
