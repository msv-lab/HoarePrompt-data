### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given code and verify its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided execution states.

#### Code Breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   A = []
   sum = 0
   ```
   - `A` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `sum` is initialized to 0.

2. **Precomputation Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 200001):
       a = func_1(i)
       sum = sum + a
       A.append(sum)
   ```
   - This loop runs from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each `i`, it computes the sum of the digits using `func_1(i)` and adds it to `sum`.
   - The cumulative sum is then appended to the list `A`.

3. **Main Execution Loop:**
   ```python
   for t in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
       print(A[n - 1])
   ```
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads the value of `n`.
   - Outputs the value at index `n-1` from the precomputed list `A`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(num):
       a = 0
       while num != 0:
           a = a + num % 10
           num = int(num / 10)
       return a
   ```
   - Computes the sum of the digits of `num`.
   - This function works correctly as intended.

#### Analysis:

- **Precomputation:**
  - The list `A` is populated with cumulative sums of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000.
  - This means `A[i-1]` contains the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

- **Main Execution:**
  - For each test case, the program simply looks up the precomputed result in `A`.
  - Since `A` is precomputed correctly, the results should match the expected outputs.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
  - There is no indication that it returns 0 or behaves incorrectly.

#### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented. It precomputes the necessary values and efficiently retrieves them for each test case. The function `func_1` works as intended, and there are no logical errors in the main logic.

### Correctness: **True**
