The code appends the result of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration and `n` remains unchanged, the value of `array2` will now include the newly computed element.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `n` is unchanged, `array2` includes the new element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
