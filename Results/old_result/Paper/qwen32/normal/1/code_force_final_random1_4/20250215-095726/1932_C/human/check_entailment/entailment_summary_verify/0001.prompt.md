You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it computes a list `ans` of cumulative products of elements in `b` taken modulo `m`, and returns this list in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task requires processing a sequence of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` and outputting the remainder of the product of all elements of the array modulo `m` before each command is executed. After processing a command, the corresponding element (leftmost or rightmost) is removed from the array.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two parts:
1. The main loop that reads the input and calls the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` which processes the commands and computes the required remainders.

#### Main Loop

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))
```

- This part correctly reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

#### Function `func_1`

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

- **Step 1:** The function initializes an empty list `b` and two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
- **Step 2:** It iterates through the commands in `s`. For each command:
  - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to `b` and increments `l`.
  - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to `b` and decrements `r`.
- **Step 3:** After collecting the elements in `b` according to the commands, it initializes an empty list `ans` and a variable `p` to store the product.
- **Step 4:** It then iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order, updating the product `p` by multiplying it with each element and taking the result modulo `m`. It appends this result to `ans`.
- **Step 5:** Finally, it returns the reversed `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

The primary issue with the program is that it does not compute the product of all elements of the array `a` before each command is processed. Instead, it only considers the elements collected in `b` and computes their product in reverse order. This means the program does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Compute the product of all elements in the array `a` initially.
2. For each command, output the current product modulo `m`.
3. Update the product by removing the appropriate element (leftmost or rightmost) and adjust the product accordingly.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the process described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
