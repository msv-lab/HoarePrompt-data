The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `k`, and `best` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is the input integer; `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such response was received; `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received.**
