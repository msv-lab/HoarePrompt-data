To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit upper bound `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `n` is an integer.
- `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The value of `ans` is determined based on certain conditions involving `i`, `x`, and `n`.

The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken some value, say `k`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Since `i` is now `k + 1`, it must be true that `k + 1 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- All other variables (`x`, `n`, `q`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

Since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head involves `i`, we adjust `i` accordingly. The other variables remain as they were described at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
