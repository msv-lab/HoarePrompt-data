The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the input provided. The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the values obtained from `map(int, input().split())`. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 4; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `L` is [1, 2]; `tot` is 3; `pow` is 32**
This means that `n` and `k` now hold the values specified by the user input, while the other variables retain their initial values.
