Given the initial state, the condition described is:

- The sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

This condition is used to determine if the print statement `print('Yes')` should execute. However, the actual values of `array2`, `n`, `b`, and `f` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical result of the condition. 

Despite this, the print statement itself does not depend on the values of these variables; it simply prints the string `'Yes'` if the condition is true.

Therefore, based on the precondition and the print statement, we can conclude that if the condition holds true, the following will be printed:

Output: **Yes**
