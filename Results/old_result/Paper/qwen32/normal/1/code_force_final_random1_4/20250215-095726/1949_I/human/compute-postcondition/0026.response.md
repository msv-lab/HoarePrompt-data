Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which may be `True` if the if condition was met, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which may be `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met, and now `coef[i]` is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` may be potentially `False`, `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), and `ok` is `True` if it was `True` initially or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0` after the if condition was met.**

In natural language: The value of `tot` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
