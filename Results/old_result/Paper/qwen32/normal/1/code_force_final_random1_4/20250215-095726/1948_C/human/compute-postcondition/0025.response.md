Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is decremented by 1 (this does not affect the print statement directly).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a string input by the user.
- `b` is a string input by the user.
- Either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Explanation:
- The value `'No'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.
- There are no conditions or calculations that alter this string before printing.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
