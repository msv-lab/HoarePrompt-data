### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the solution is correct.

The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Given the frequencies `a` and `b` at which the two installations launch fireworks and the visibility duration `m + 1` for each firework, we need to determine how many fireworks can overlap in their visibility period.

The key part of the solution involves calculating `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`. This represents the earliest time when fireworks from both installations could potentially overlap in their visibility period.

The logic in the code is as follows:
- Calculate `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
- Check if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
  - If true, print `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
  - Otherwise, print `mn // a + mn // b`.

However, the condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):` is not correctly addressing the problem. The additional `+ 1` term is not justified based on the problem description. 

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
- Compute the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at `mn`: `mn // a`.
- Compute the number of fireworks from the second installation visible at `mn`: `mn // b`.
- The total number of fireworks visible at `mn` is `mn // a + mn // b`.

The special condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` does not necessarily mean that there should be an additional firework counted. The code incorrectly adds `+ 1` under this condition, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to the unnecessary addition of `+ 1` under certain conditions.

**Correctness: False**
