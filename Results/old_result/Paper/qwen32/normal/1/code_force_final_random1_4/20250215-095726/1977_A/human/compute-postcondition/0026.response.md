In this task, we are given an initial state with several variables and their descriptions. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
