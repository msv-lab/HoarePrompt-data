To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `while p <= i - 1:`. The variables involved in this condition are `p` and `i`.

Given the current state:
- `p` is 3
- `i` must be at least 3
- `d` is 0
- `h` is `(h_initial - 3) / 4`
- `s` is the accumulated sum until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches `k`
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `g` is `g + (h_initial + 1) // 2 + ((h_initial - (h_initial + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2)`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `p <= i - 1` must be true. Given that `p` is 3, `i` must be at least 4 to satisfy the condition (`3 <= 4 - 1` is false, but `3 <= 5 - 1` is true).

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 4.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the accumulated sum until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches `k`, `i` must be at least 4, `d` is 0, `h` is `(h_initial - 3) / 4`, `p` is 3, `g` is `g + (h_initial + 1) // 2 + ((h_initial - (h_initial + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2)`**
