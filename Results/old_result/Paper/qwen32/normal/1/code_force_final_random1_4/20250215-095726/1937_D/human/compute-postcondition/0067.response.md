The code snippet `b = b - B[x]` modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` from it. Given the initial state, `b` is initially set to `B[r - 1]`. After executing the code, `b` will be updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.

Here's the output state:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is less than `r`; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)` and `x` is greater than or equal to 0; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `s` remains a string consisting of '<' and '>', `n` remains the length of the string `s` and is greater than 0, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged, `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged, `l` is still less than `r`, `r` remains the number of '<' characters in `s`, `i` still points to an index where `s[i]` is '>', `a` remains `A[l]`, `x` remains `r - (l + 2)` and is still greater than or equal to 0, and `b` is now `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.
