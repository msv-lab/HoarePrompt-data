Postcondition: **`i` is `m`, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, and if the new value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
