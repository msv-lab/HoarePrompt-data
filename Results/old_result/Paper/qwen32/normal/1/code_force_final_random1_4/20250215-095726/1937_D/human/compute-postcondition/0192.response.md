The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. The variables `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `a`.

Given that `r` is decreased by 1 before this line, the value of `a` will be the element in `B` at the index which is one less than the original value of `r`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `B[r]`.**
