To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the operations performed on the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`: An input integer representing the length of the list `ar`.
- `ar`: A list of integers of length `n`.
- `res`: A list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
- `mex`: The smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the `res` list.

### Calculation of `res` and `mex`:
1. **Initialization**: The `res` list is initialized with `n` elements, but its values depend on the calculation involving `mex`.
2. **Calculation of `mex`**: `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the `res` list. Initially, `mex` starts from 0 and increments until it finds a value not in `res`.

### Process to Determine `res`:
- For each element in `ar`, the corresponding element in `res` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
- After calculating `res[i]`, the `mex` is recalculated to ensure it is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the updated `res`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement joins the elements of the `res` list into a single string separated by spaces and prints it.

### Detailed Explanation:
Given the initial state, the `res` list is constructed based on the `mex` value. Each element in `res` is determined by subtracting the corresponding element in `ar` from `mex`. The `mex` value is adjusted after each assignment to ensure it remains the smallest non-negative integer not in `res`.

Since the exact values of `ar` and the number of iterations (`t`) are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `res`. However, we can describe the process and the final output format.

### Final Output Description:
The output will be a space-separated string of integers, where each integer is the result of the calculation `mex - ar[i]` for each element in `ar`.

Output: **space-separated values of the `res` list (where each value is `mex - ar[i]` and `mex` is recalculated after each assignment to ensure it is the smallest non-negative integer not in `res`)**
