Given the code snippet `custo += b_values[y]`, the value of `custo` will be updated by adding the value of `b_values[y]` to it. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `custo` is initially 120.
- `b_values` is `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`.

Since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that will be added to `custo`. However, we can express the new value of `custo` as `120 + b_values[y]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is `120 + b_values[y]`, `custos` is `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` is `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input. Additionally, `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`.**
