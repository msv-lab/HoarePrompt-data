In this task, we need to determine the output of the `print` statement given the initial state of the program. Let's analyze the provided information:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is the newly input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any of the variables `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
