Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Leading Zeroes**: The program does not correctly handle leading zeroes for hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format.
2. **Special Case for 12 PM/AM**: The program incorrectly handles the transition from 12 AM to 1 PM and vice versa.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input().split(':')
        hour = int(s[0])
        minute = s[1]
        
        # Determine AM or PM
        period = "AM" if hour < 12 else "PM"
        
        # Convert hour to 12-hour format
        if hour == 0:
            hour = 12
        elif hour > 12:
            hour -= 12
        
        # Format hour and minute with leading zeroes if necessary
        print(f"{hour:02}:{minute} {period}")

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Hours between 1 and 9 are printed with a leading zero.
- The special cases for 12 AM and 12 PM are handled correctly.
- The output format matches the required specification.
