Postcondition: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3. If `xx[5][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[5][2]`. Otherwise, `nx` is either the original value of `nx` with 'S' appended if `i` or `j` is found in `sb[:n // 4]`, or the original value of `nx` plus 'F' otherwise.**
