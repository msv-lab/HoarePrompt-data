To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, so `ai` is the variable that changes with each iteration.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
- `year` is updated as `year + (year % ai or ai)`, where `ai` is the second element of the list `a`.

In the previous iteration, `ai` was the second element of the list `a`. For the next iteration, `ai` will take the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Let's denote the elements of the list `a` as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, ..., `a[len(a)-1]`. If `ai` was `a[1]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `ai` will be `a[2]`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of the elements in the list `a` except that it has at least two elements, we can only say that `ai` will now be the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `year` is unchanged from the previous iteration, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`**.

However, since `year` is updated within the loop and we don't have its value from the previous iteration, we should not include it in the state description unless explicitly required. Thus, the final state considering only the variables in the loop head (`ai` and the list `a`) is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`**. 

But strictly adhering to the requirement of adjusting only the objects in the loop head, we get:

State: **`ai` is the third element of the list `a`**. 

Since `t`, `n`, and `a` do not change in the loop head, they remain the same. Therefore, the complete state considering all relevant variables is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`**.
