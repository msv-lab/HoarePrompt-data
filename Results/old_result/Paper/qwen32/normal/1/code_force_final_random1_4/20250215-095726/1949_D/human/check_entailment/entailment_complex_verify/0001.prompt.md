You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the sequence "aFbScSdSaFbScSdSaFbScSdS..." is repeated `n` times. Otherwise, a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, is created where each character is either directly from `xx[i][j-1]` or determined by the conditions involving `sb`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix representing the nature of transition videos between scenarios. It processes this matrix to replace '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on certain conditions. The function then prints `n` strings, each of length `n`, where each character is either directly from the input matrix or determined by the processing rules.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` of size `n+1` to keep track of the count of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transitions for each scenario.
   - It reads the next `n` lines into a list `xx`, where each line represents the transition videos for a scenario.

2. **Counting Funny and Scary Transitions:**
   - For each scenario `i`, it iterates through the transitions to `j` and increments `a[i]` and `a[j]` if the transition is `F`, or `b[i]` and `b[j]` if the transition is `S`.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only Funny or Scary Transitions:**
   - It creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny (`F`) or only scary (`S`) transitions, respectively.

4. **Deciding Remaining Transitions:**
   - If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, it appends scenarios with no decided transitions to `sa`.
   - For each scenario `i`, it constructs a new string `nx` by iterating through the transitions:
     - If the transition is already decided (`F` or `S`), it keeps it as is.
     - If the transition is undecided (`?`), it assigns `F` if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, it assigns `S`.
   - If the length of `sb` is greater than the length of `sa`, it follows a similar process but assigns `S` for scenarios in the first `n//4` elements of `sb` and `F` otherwise.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed transition matrix.

### Issues and Flaws:

- **Logic for Deciding Transitions:**
  - The logic for deciding the remaining transitions is flawed. The program uses the first `n//4` elements of `sa` or `sb` to assign `F` or `S` to undecided transitions. This does not guarantee that the condition of having no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type is met.
  - The decision-making process does not consider the overall sequence of transitions across all permutations of scenarios, which is crucial to satisfy the problem's requirement.

- **Handling of Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program does not ensure that the assignment of `F` and `S` to undecided transitions respects the constraint for all possible permutations of scenarios. It only considers a subset of scenarios (`sa` or `sb`) to make decisions, which is insufficient.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the decision-making process for assigning `F` and `S` to undecided transitions, the program does not guarantee that the output will meet the problem's requirements for all permutations of scenarios.

**Correctness:** **False**
