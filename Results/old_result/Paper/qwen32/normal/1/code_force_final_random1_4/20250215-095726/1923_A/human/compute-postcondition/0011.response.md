The code snippet reassigns the value of `x` to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. Given the initial state, `x` was already defined as the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found. Since the code does not change the string `arr` or alter the logic of finding the first occurrence of '1', the value of `x` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
