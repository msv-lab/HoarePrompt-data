The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented from `i_prev` to `i_prev + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1, making it `i_prev + 2`.

The variable `n` remains unchanged as it represents the length of the string `s` and does not change throughout the iterations.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 2`.**
