To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly the list `l` since it's being indexed by `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input
- `score` is `l[i]`

From the loop definition, `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 each iteration until it reaches `2 * n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value that allowed the loop to continue executing. Since `i` increments by 2, if the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `k + 2`.

2. **Condition for Loop Continuation:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < 2 * n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i + 2` must be less than `2 * n`.

3. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2`.

4. **No Changes Needed for `n` and `l`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is the list being indexed.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`.
- The new value of `i` should be the previous value plus 2, ensuring that the loop can continue to execute if `i + 2 < 2 * n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 2`, `score` is `l[i + 2]`**
