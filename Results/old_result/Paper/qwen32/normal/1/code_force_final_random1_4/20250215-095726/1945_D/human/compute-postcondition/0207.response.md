To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the given loop and the conditions under which it operates. Here's the loop code again for reference:

```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break
```

Given:
- `max_p` is 2, so the loop runs for `y` in the range `(2 - 1, 0, -1)`, which means `y` will take the value 1.
- `a_values` is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
- `b_values` is `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`

Let's evaluate the loop step-by-step:

1. **First (and only) iteration (`y = 1`)**:
   - Condition check: `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`
     - Substituting the values: `a_values[0] + b_values[1] <= a_values[1]`
     - This translates to: `10 + 25 <= 20`
     - The condition `35 <= 20` is false.
   - Since the condition is false, the `else` block is executed:
     - `custo += a_values[y]`
     - `custo += 20`
     - Therefore, `custo` becomes `120 + 20 = 140`.
   - The `break` statement is encountered, so the loop terminates immediately.

Since the loop only runs once and terminates after the first iteration, the final output state is:

Output State: **custo is 140, custos is [50, 90, 120], i remains i_end + (num_fila - max_p), x remains unchanged, num_fila is 5, max_p is 2, a_values is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], b_values is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55], nf remains a list of substrings from the input, a remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, b remains a list of substrings from the new input.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, the value of `custo` is 140, while all other variables remain unchanged as per their initial states.
