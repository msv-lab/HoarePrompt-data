The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then the conditions remain as they are.
- Otherwise, `lis` contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Since only `i` needs to be adjusted, and it is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we simply need to increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is 3**.

Generalizing this, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
