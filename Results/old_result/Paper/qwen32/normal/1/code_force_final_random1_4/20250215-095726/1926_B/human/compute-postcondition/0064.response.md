To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop behaves based on the given conditions and the provided outputs after the first three iterations.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Structure:**
   - The outer loop runs `a` times.
   - For each iteration of the outer loop, an inner loop reads `int(input())` lines of input, counts the number of '1's in each line that contains at least one '1', and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - After processing the lines for an iteration, it checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

2. **Observations from Given Outputs:**
   - After the first iteration, the list `k` contains counts of '1's from the lines read during that iteration. If the first two counts are equal, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".
   - This behavior repeats for the second and third iterations.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - The loop will continue to execute until it has completed `a` iterations.
   - Each iteration independently processes its own set of input lines and prints "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the comparison of the first two counts in `k` for that iteration.
   - The state of `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution except for the variable `i` in the loop header which simply tracks the current iteration number.

### Conclusion:
- The final output state will consist of `a` print statements, each being either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE", depending on the comparison of the first two counts of '1's in the lines read during each iteration.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **a print statements, each being either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE", based on the comparison of the first two counts of '1's in the lines read during each iteration.**
