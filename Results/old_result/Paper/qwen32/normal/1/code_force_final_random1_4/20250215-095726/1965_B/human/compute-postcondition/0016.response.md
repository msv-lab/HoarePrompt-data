The code snippet assigns the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`. 

Given that `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, the value of `bk` will be a binary string corresponding to the value of `k`.

The variables `n`, `k`, `b` (binary string representation of `n`), and `l` (length of `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 < k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`.**
