### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: Multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
2. **Output**: For each test case, output the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
   - \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
   - \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \)

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
  - It initializes `cnt` to 0.
  - It iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
  - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
  - It checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1`.
  - If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
  - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Floating Point Arithmetic**: The code uses floating-point division (`/`) which can lead to incorrect results due to precision issues. The problem requires integer arithmetic.
2. **Incorrect Condition Handling**: The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not directly checked. Instead, the code attempts to count pairs based on a derived formula which may not be accurate.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic used in `func_1` to count pairs seems flawed. It does not correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \% (a + b) == 0 \). Given the constraints, an efficient approach would involve precomputing gcd values or using mathematical insights to reduce the number of checks.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
