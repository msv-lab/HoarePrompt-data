The code snippet `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is `[0]`. After appending `i`, `p` becomes `[0, i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `i` is `x`, `j` is `1` if `x` is `1`; otherwise, `j` is `0`, and `c` is `[0]`.**
