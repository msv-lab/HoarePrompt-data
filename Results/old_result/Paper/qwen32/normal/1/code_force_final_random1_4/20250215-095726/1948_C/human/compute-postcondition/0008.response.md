Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the newly input string of length `n`. At the current index `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` and `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not alter the values of any variables.
