The code snippet initializes an empty list named `array2`. None of the other variables (`i`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `n` is `feat[0]`; `f` is `feat[1]`; `a` is `feat[2]`; `b` is `feat[-1]`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `array2` is an empty list.**
