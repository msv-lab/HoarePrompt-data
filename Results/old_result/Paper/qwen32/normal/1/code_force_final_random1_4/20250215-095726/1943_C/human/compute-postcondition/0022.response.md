To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(d)` does. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only assume that it takes the list `d` as input and returns some value or modifies it in some way. However, without the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only infer that `a` will hold the return value of `func_1(d)`. 

Given the lack of details about `func_1`, the best we can do is to say that `a` now holds whatever `func_1(d)` returns. The adjacency list `u2vs` and the distance list `d` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the problem statement.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the graph; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.**
