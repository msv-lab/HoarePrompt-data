The code snippet provided appends the character `'F'` to the string `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` changes by having `'F'` added to its current value. None of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, `j`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` has `'F'` appended to its original value.**
