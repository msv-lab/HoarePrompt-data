Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program uses the following logic to determine the minimum cost:
     - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`a * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Hence, the total cost is `n * a`.
     - If `n` is even, the program calculates the cost by buying all yogurts in pairs using the promotional price. Thus, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
     - If `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible (`(n // 2) * b`) and then buying the remaining single yogurt at the regular price (`a`). Thus, the total cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

3. **Comparison with Example Test Cases:**
   - Let's verify the logic against the provided example test cases.
     - **Test Case 1:** `n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`
       - Since `a * 2 = 10 > b = 9`, we use the promotion for both yogurts.
       - Total cost: `1 * 9 = 9`.
     - **Test Case 2:** `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`
       - Since `a * 2 = 10 > b = 9`, we use the promotion for two yogurts and buy one individually.
       - Total cost: `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - **Test Case 3:** `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`
       - Since `a * 2 = 10 < b = 11`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
       - Total cost: `3 * 5 = 15`.
     - **Test Case 4:** `n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`
       - Since `a * 2 = 10 < b = 11`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
       - Total cost: `4 * 5 = 20`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `n` is 1 correctly by default since the loop will not enter the `elif` or `else` block, and it will calculate `n * a` which is `1 * a`.
   - It also handles cases where `n` is even or odd correctly as per the logic described.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It handles all the provided test cases correctly and accounts for different scenarios based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

**Correctness: True**
