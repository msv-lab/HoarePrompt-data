Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers from the input with at least one element, `j` is the number of elements processed, `p` is the number of elements processed, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, and `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is set to 1 and `ans1` is incremented by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` does not equal `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
