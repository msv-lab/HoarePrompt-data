Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`n`**: The newly input integer for the current test case. It indicates the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers obtained from the latest input. This list contains `n` integers and is sorted in ascending order.
4. **`ntest`**: Must be greater than `itest`. This suggests there is a loop iterating through test cases, and `ntest` could represent the total number of test cases or some threshold.
5. **`itest`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value. This indicates that `itest` keeps track of the current test case number.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Explanation:
- **`a[len(a) - 1]`**: This accesses the last element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, this is the maximum value in the list.
- **`a[0]`**: This accesses the first element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, this is the minimum value in the list.
- **`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**: This calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list `a`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the sorted list `a`**
