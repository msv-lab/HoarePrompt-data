### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. Specifically, we want to maximize the expression:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

#### Key Insight:
To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the sum of differences between consecutive elements is maximized.

#### Simplification:
The provided solution simplifies this by only considering the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_{\text{max}} - a_{\text{min}} \]

Let's verify this simplification:
- When the array is sorted, the beauty can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]
- Notice that all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]
- This is indeed the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify with the first example:
- Input: `3 2 1 3`
- Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- The provided solution outputs `3-1=2`, which is correct.

Let's verify with another example:
- Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
- Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Beauty: `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
- The provided solution outputs `100-43=57`, which is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct because it correctly identifies that the maximum beauty of the array, when sorted, is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array. This is a valid and efficient way to solve the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
