The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Initially, `idx` is 3, so after the operation, `idx` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 4, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`.**
