Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. Additionally, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` including the newly added `i`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` including the newly added `i`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` remains the same. If `a[i] != 0` or `b[i] != 0`, then `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` remains the same. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` now includes the new value of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
