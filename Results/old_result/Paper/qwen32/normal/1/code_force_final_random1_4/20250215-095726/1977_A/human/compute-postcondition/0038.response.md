The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and `i` is 2. However, these variables (`t` and `i`) are not affected by the code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, `n` and `m` will hold the values of the two integers read from the input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
