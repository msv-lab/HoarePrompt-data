The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet letters, `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, `j` is 2**
