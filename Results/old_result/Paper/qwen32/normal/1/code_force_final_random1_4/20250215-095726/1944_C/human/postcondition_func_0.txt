The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `arr` where each integer is within the range `[0, n-1]` and `n` is the length of `arr`. It prints the smallest integer that is missing from the sequence starting from `0` after accounting for the counts of each integer in the list. The function does not return any meaningful value; it either prints a number and exits or simply prints a number at the end of its execution.
