To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(n + 1):`.

In the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` would have taken on a value from `0` to `n`. At the end of this iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

If the loop has just completed the iteration where `i` was `n`, then the loop will terminate because `i` would now be `n + 1`, which is out of the range `[0, n]`.

However, if `i_prev < n`, then the loop will continue, and `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (`i_prev`), we can generalize that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration, adjusting only the variables in the loop head, will be:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `sm` is either `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` remains `-111` if `suf[i] - smin[i] <= sm`**

But since we need to specify the exact state and `i` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, we can say:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to be precise about the transition, if `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate, so we should consider the case where `i < n`:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1` where `i < n`**

Since we need to provide a concrete state, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, where `k < n`. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

So, the most accurate state representation, without knowing the exact `i` value, but ensuring it is within the loop bounds, is:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1` where `i < n`**

For concreteness in the answer format:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

Given the loop structure, the most precise adjustment for the next iteration is:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1` where `i < n`**

But for a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration and `n` is 5, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3**

Therefore, the final answer in the required format is:

State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
