The given initial state provides specific conditions about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement in the provided code snippet. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. This variable does not influence the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `a`:** It is an input integer. This variable also does not influence the `print` statement.
3. **List `b`:** It is a list of integers with specific conditions regarding its first and last elements. These conditions ensure certain properties about the list, but they do not affect the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their values. It directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
