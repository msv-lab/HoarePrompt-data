Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is not greater than 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**
