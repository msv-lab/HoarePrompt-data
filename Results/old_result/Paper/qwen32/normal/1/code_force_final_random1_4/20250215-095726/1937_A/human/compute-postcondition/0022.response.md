The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n_cases` is equal to `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, and `n` is either 1 or `log2(n_cases)`. If `n` is 1, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `power` is calculated as `log2(t)`, and if `power` is not equal to `n`, it is adjusted to `log2(t) - 1`.**
