The code snippet updates the value of `next_year` by adding the value of `ai` to `current_year`. Since `next_year` was previously equal to `current_year`, the new value of `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year` - `ai`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the second element in the list `a`; `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**
