N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented by a 2D list of strings with dimensions N x M, where each string is either ".." (empty cell), "R0" to "R9" (red players), "B0" to "B9" (blue players), "RG" (red goal), "BG" (blue goal), or ".Q" (Quaffle). T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. The following T lines describe the actions, where each action consists of a pair of characters representing the entity and a command (U, D, L, R, C, or T). If the command is C, it is followed by another pair of characters representing the ball to be caught.
