Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1440; `s` is `input_string`; `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` is not equal to '00', and `h` remains unchanged regardless of whether the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.**
