To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least one integer.
- `p_1` is 5.
- `p_2` is 5.
- `p_3` is 5.
- `p_4` is 6.
- `cnt` is 1 if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, otherwise `cnt` is 0.

Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
```

The code snippet increments `cnt` by the floor division of `x` by 2. This means that `cnt` will be updated to its current value plus the integer part of `x / 2`.

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can express the new value of `cnt` in terms of `x`.

If `cnt` was initially 1 (because the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd), the new value of `cnt` will be `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`.
If `cnt` was initially 0 (because the first three elements of `a` are not equal or not all odd), the new value of `cnt` will be `0 + math.floor(x / 2)`.

Therefore, the Output State can be described as follows:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least one integer; `p_1` is 5; `p_2` is 5; `p_3` is 5; `p_4` is 6; `cnt` is `1 + math.floor(x / 2)` if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, otherwise `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2)`.**
