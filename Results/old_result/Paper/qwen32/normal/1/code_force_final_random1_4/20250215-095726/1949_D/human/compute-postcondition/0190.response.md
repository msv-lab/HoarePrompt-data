Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'S' appended.**
