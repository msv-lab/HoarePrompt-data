The code snippet reassigns the value of `mn` using the current values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. The new value of `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. Similarly, `i` is described as `i + 1`, indicating it was incremented before this line, and thus remains `i + 1` after this line. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input and also remain unchanged by this line of code.

The only change is in the value of `mn`, which is now set to `min(a, b) + m`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.**
