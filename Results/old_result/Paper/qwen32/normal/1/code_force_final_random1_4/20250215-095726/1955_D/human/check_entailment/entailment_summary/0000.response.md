### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach combined with frequency counting. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes a list `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1` (where `max_val` is set to 1,000,000) to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It populates `cnt_b` with the frequency of elements in `b` and creates a set `b_values` containing the unique elements of `b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of good subarrays and `curr` to count the current number of matching elements in the window.
   - It first processes the initial window of size `m` in array `a`. For each element in this window, if the element is in `b_values`, it decrements its count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count remains non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.
   - It then slides the window one element at a time from left to right across array `a`. For each new position:
     - It adjusts the count for the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`) by incrementing its count in `cnt_b` and decrementing `curr` if necessary.
     - It adjusts the count for the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`) by decrementing its count in `cnt_b` and incrementing `curr` if necessary.
     - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after adjusting for the new window, it increments `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, it prints the count of good subarrays (`ans`).

5. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - It resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` before starting the next test case.

The logic and implementation of the sliding window technique ensure that the program efficiently counts the number of good subarrays without having to recompute the count from scratch for each window. This approach is optimal given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
