Postcondition: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited during the DFS traversals, `coef` is a list of integers where each element is either `1` or `-1` indicating the bipartition of the graph, `tot` is the sum of the `r` values for nodes in one of the partitions, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite and `False` otherwise, `i` is `n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `ok` is `True`. Additionally, there exists at least one bipartite component with a non-zero total `r` value.**
