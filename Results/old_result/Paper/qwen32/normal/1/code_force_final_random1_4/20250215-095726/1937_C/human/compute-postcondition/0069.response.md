Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such response was received; `best` is the current value of `i`; `res` is the value of the user's input; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `best` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous values.
