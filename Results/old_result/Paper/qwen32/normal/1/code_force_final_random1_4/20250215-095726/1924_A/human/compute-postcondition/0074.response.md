The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `cur_ss` by recalculating it using the current value of `ss`. Initially, `cur_ss` is set to `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, and `ss` is set to `s[1]`. After executing the line `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur_ss` will again be equal to `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')` because `ss` is `s[1]`.

Since the values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `tmp`, `i`, and the initial `cur_ss` and `ss` remain unchanged, they are included in the output state as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[1]`**.
