The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment.

Given that `t` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`. Regardless of whether `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` remain unchanged except `i` which is incremented.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect this in the state for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`. Regardless of whether `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` remain unchanged.**
