The code snippet appends the character 'S' to the variable `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we can only infer that after the operation, `nx` will have its original value plus the character 'S' appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is its original value with 'S' appended**.
