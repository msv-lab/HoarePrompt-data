The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4.
3. For the next iteration, `i` should be 5 (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).

The state of `nx`, `xx`, `sb`, and `n` does not change according to the loop head; they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[4][0]` to `xx[4][n-1]` where each character is determined by the conditions given in the loop. If `xx[4][j-1]` is not '?', it is appended directly. If `xx[4][j-1]` is '?', 'S' is appended if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]`; otherwise, 'F' is appended. `i` remains 4, but for the next iteration `i` is 5.** 

However, since the question specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, the correct state representation focusing only on `i` is:

State: **`i` is 5**
