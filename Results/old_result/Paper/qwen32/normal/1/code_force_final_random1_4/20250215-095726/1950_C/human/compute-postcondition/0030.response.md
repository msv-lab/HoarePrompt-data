Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439; `s` is the new input string; `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. If `h` is '00', the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, if `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, the conditions remain as stated.**

To simplify the explanation:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439; `s` is the new input string; `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. The conditions remain unchanged regardless of the value of `h`.**
