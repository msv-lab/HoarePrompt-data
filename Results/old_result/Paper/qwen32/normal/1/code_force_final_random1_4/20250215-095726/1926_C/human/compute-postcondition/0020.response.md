To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `pd` list. The loop iterates over the digits of the current value of `i`, adds these digits to `pd[i]`, and then increments `i`. Given the initial state and the first few iterations, we can infer the behavior of the loop for all iterations up to `t`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: Input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
   - `N`: 200001
   - `pd`: A list of 200001 zeros except `pd[4]` which is 7 (since the sum of the digits of 4 is 4, but it's explicitly stated as 7).
   - `i`: 4

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, the loop converts `i` to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts the character back to an integer, and adds it to `pd[i]`.
   - After processing `i`, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **First Few Iterations:**
   - **Iteration 1 (`i = 4`):**
     - `pd[4]` is initially 7.
     - The digits of 4 are [4].
     - `pd[4]` becomes `7 + 4 = 11`.
   - **Iteration 2 (`i = 5`):**
     - `pd[5]` is initially 0.
     - The digits of 5 are [5].
     - `pd[5]` becomes `0 + 5 = 5`.
   - **Iteration 3 (`i = 6`):**
     - `pd[6]` is initially 0.
     - The digits of 6 are [6].
     - `pd[6]` becomes `0 + 6 = 6`.

4. **General Pattern:**
   - For each `i` from 4 to `t`, the sum of the digits of `i` is added to `pd[i]`.

5. **Final Output State:**
   - `t`: Remains the same as the input integer.
   - `N`: Remains 200001.
   - `pd`: A list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 4 to `t` contains the sum of the digits of `i`. All other elements remain 0.
   - `i`: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `t + 1`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 4 to `t`, `i` is `t + 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop completes, the `pd` list will have the sum of the digits of each integer from 4 to `t` stored at the corresponding index, while all other indices remain zero. The variable `i` will be one more than the input integer `t`.
