The value of `k` is updated to the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `k` now holds the value `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is `n-1`; `best` is 1; `res` is the value of the user's input and `res` equals `<`; `i` is `n-1`.**
