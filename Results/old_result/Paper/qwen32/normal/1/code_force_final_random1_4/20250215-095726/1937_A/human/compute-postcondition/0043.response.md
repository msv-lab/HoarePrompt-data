Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is set to the value of `t`.
- `i` is initialized to 2.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement simply outputs the number `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. None of these variables are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the number `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
