Let's calculate the new value of `cnt` based on the given initial state and the code snippet.

Given:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is 0
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, let's compute the two expressions inside the `min` function:

1. `n / ((x + y) * x)`
   - `(x + y) * x` evaluates to `(1 + 1) * 1` which is `2`.
   - `n / 2` evaluates to `5 / 2` which is `2.5`.

2. `m // ((x + y) * y)`
   - `(x + y) * y` evaluates to `(1 + 1) * 1` which is `2`.
   - `m // 2` evaluates to `20 // 2` which is `10`.

Now, we take the minimum of these two results:
- `min(2.5, 10)` evaluates to `2.5`.

Finally, we add this result to `cnt`:
- `cnt += 2.5` means `cnt` changes from `0` to `2.5`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is still 5
- `m` is still 20
- `x` is still 1
- `y` is still 1
- `cnt` is now 2.5
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1 (unchanged).

Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, `cnt` is 2.5, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
