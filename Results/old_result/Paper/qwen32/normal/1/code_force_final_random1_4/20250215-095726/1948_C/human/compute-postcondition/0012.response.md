Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the newly input string of length `n`, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but no variables are modified by this statement.
