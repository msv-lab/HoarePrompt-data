To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the range `(n - m)` must be greater than 0. This means `n` must be greater than `m`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` is initialized to `m` before the loop starts, but within the loop, it will take values from `0` to `n - m - 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` (which is `m`) does not affect whether the loop will execute; it only affects the starting point of `i` inside the loop.

2. **Variable `n`:** For the loop to execute at least once, `n - m` must be greater than 0, implying `n > m`.

Since the problem specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `m`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `m`**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
