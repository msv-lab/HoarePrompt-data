The code snippet `custo += b_values[y]` adds the value of `b_values[y]` to the current value of `custo`. Given the initial state, `custo` was 0, and after this operation, `custo` will be equal to `b_values[y]`.

The list `custos` is supposed to contain all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, but since there is no operation to append the new value of `custo` to `custos` in the provided code snippet, `custos` remains unchanged.

All other variables (`i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, and the condition `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`custo` is `b_values[y]`, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`.**
