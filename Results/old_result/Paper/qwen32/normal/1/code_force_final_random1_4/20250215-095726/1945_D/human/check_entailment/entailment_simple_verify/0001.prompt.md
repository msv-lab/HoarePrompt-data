You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Kirill is in a queue and wants to move to one of the first `m` positions. He can bribe people to swap places, paying `a_i` coins to swap directly with the person at position `i`, or `b_k` coins to pass through each person `k` between his current position and position `i`. The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Solution Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve this problem using a greedy strategy. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - Read the lists `a` and `b` which represent the costs associated with swapping and passing through, respectively.

2. **Adjust Indices**:
   - Convert `n` and `m` to zero-based indices (`na_frente -= 1` and `pos_final -= 1`).

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Initialize `total` to 0 (total cost incurred so far).
   - Initialize `best` to a very large number (initially the best cost is unknown).
   - Iterate from the last person in the queue to the first person:
     - If the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions:
       - Update `best` if the current cost (`total + a[v]`) is less than the previously recorded best cost.
       - Decide whether to add `a[v]` or `b[v]` to `total` based on which is smaller.
     - If the current position `v` is beyond the first `m` positions:
       - Still decide whether to add `a[v]` or `b[v]` to `total` based on which is smaller.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the best cost found for each test case.

### Issues with the Solution

The main issue with this solution is the greedy approach used to calculate the cost. The code assumes that always choosing the smaller of `a[v]` and `b[v]` will lead to the minimum total cost, which is not necessarily true. The optimal solution might require considering more complex interactions between different positions and costs.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a priority queue to explore all possible ways Kirill could move to the first `m` positions while keeping track of the minimum cost. The greedy approach might miss the optimal path due to the dependencies between different positions and costs.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided solution does not guarantee the correct result for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
