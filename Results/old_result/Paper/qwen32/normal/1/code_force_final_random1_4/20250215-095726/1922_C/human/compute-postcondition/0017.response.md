The code snippet updates the value in the `d1` dictionary at the key `i + 2` by setting it to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the key `i + 2` evaluates to 5, and the key `i + 1` evaluates to 4.

Thus, `d1[5]` is set to `1 + d1[4]`. Since `d1` is a defaultdict with `int` as the default factory, `d1[4]` defaults to 0 if it hasn't been set before. Therefore, `d1[5]` becomes `1 + 0`, which is 1.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[5]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
