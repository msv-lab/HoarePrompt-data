Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements. If `n` is at least 2 and `m` is at least 2, and `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`. The value of `impossible` remains unchanged.**
