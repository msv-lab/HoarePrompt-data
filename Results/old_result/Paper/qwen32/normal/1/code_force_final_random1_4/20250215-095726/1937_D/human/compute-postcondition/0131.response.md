Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**.

The value of `b` has been updated to subtract `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
