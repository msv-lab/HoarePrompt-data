Let's calculate the new value of `cnt` using the given formula:

Given:
- `n` is 6
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is 8.1667

The formula to update `cnt` is:
```
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, let's compute each part of the `min` function:

1. Compute `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (1 + 3) * 1 = 4
   \]
   \[
   n / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
   \]

2. Compute `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (1 + 3) * 3 = 12
   \]
   \[
   m // 12 = 20 // 12 = 1 \quad \text{(integer division)}
   \]

Now, take the minimum of these two results:
\[
\min(1.5, 1) = 1
\]

Finally, update `cnt`:
\[
cnt += 1 \implies cnt = 8.1667 + 1 = 9.1667
\]

The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is 6, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 9.1667**
