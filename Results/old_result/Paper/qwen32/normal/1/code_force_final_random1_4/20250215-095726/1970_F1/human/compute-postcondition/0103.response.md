The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `points`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in the input; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `t` is an integer read from the input.**
