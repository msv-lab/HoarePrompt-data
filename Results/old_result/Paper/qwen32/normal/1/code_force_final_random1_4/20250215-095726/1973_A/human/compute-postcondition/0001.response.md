In the given task, the for loop iterates over the elements of the list `cas_de_test`, where each element is a tuple containing three integers `(p1, p2, p3)`. To ensure that the loop executes, the list `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple.

Let's analyze the loop head and the variables involved:

- The loop variable `(p1, p2, p3)` will take on the values of each tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- The loop will execute if `cas_de_test` has at least one tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
- `resultats` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `cas_de_test` contains at least one tuple. The value of `t` does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but it might be related to the number of test cases, so we should ensure that the length of `cas_de_test` matches `t`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list**.

Since the loop depends on `cas_de_test` having at least one tuple, we ensure that condition is met. The specific values of `p1, p2, p3` in the tuple(s) are not specified as needing adjustment for the loop to execute, only that there must be at least one tuple in `cas_de_test`.
