In this task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is provided by the user input and is constrained by \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, and it doesn't affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`. Since the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, and given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the initial state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4** (no further adjustment needed)
