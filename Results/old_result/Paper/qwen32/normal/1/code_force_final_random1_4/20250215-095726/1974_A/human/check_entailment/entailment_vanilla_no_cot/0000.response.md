Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. Let's analyze why:

1. The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which seems to be an attempt to determine how many screens are needed for the `2x2` icons. However, this calculation is flawed because it doesn't account for the exact placement of `2x2` icons and may overestimate the number of screens needed.

2. The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This calculation is not meaningful in the context of the problem and seems to be an incorrect attempt to determine remaining space after placing `2x2` icons.

3. The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect. Here, `a` represents the total number of test cases, not the remaining space or any relevant value for the current test case. Also, the logic inside this condition is flawed and does not correctly compute the additional screens needed for `1x1` icons.

4. The final calculation `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is incorrect for determining the number of additional screens needed for `1x1` icons. It incorrectly uses `m` and does not properly account for the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Place as many `2x2` icons as possible on each screen without exceeding the grid size.
- Calculate the remaining space on each screen after placing `2x2` icons.
- Place the `1x1` icons in the remaining space, using additional screens if necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        while y > 0:
            # We can place at most 2 2x2 icons per screen
            if y >= 2:
                screens += 1
                y -= 2
            elif y == 1:
                screens += 1
                y -= 1
        
        # Calculate remaining space on the last screen used for 2x2 icons
        # If we placed 2 2x2 icons, we used 8 cells, leaving 7 cells
        # If we placed 1 2x2 icon, we used 4 cells, leaving 11 cells
        remaining_space = 15
        if y == 0:
            if screens > 0:
                remaining_space = 11 if screens % 2 == 1 else 7
        
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining space
        if x > 0:
            screens += (x + remaining_space - 1) // remaining_space
        
        print(screens)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that `2x2` icons are placed optimally and then calculates the number of additional screens needed for `1x1` icons.
