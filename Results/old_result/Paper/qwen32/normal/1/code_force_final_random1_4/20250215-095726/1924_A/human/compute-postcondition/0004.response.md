The given code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0**.
