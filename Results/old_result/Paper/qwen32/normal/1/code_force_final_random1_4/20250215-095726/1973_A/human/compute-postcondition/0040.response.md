The given code calculates the value of `egalites` based on the current values of `total_points`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `total_matchs` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Here's the calculation for `egalites`:
- `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`

Let's simplify this expression:
- `egalites = total_points - 2*p3 + 2*p2 - 2*p3 + 2*p1`
- `egalites = total_points - 4*p3 + 2*p2 + 2*p1`

Since `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, we substitute it in:
- `egalites = (p1 + p2 + p3) - 4*p3 + 2*p2 + 2*p1`
- `egalites = p1 + p2 + p3 - 4*p3 + 2*p2 + 2*p1`
- `egalites = 3*p1 + 3*p2 - 3*p3`
- `egalites = 3*(p1 + p2 - p3)`

Therefore, the new value of `egalites` is `3*(p1 + p2 - p3)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `-1` is appended to `resultats`. `egalites` is `3*(p1 + p2 - p3)`**.
