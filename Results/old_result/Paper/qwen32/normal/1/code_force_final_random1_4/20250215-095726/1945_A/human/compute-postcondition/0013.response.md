Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` and returns a result indicating whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to the sum of `b` and `c`. Specifically, if `a` is greater than `b + c`, it returns "Case #X: true", where X is the test case number; if `a` is less than or equal to `b + c`, it returns "Case #X: false".**
