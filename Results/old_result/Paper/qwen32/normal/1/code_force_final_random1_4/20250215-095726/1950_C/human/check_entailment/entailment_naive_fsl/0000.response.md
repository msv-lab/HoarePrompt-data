Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The program starts with `func_1()` before defining the function `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError` because the function is called before it is defined.

2. **Handling of Hours**:
   - When `h == '00'`, it correctly prints `'12'`.
   - For `int(h) <= 12`, it correctly prints `h`.
   - For `int(h) > 12`, it incorrectly formats the hour by subtracting 12 and prefixing with '0'. For example, if `h` is '13', it will print `'01'` instead of `'01'` without the leading zero check, but more importantly, it will print `'01'` instead of `'01'` directly. However, the main issue is that it doesn't handle the case where `h` is '12' correctly in the PM part.
   
3. **AM/PM Selection**:
   - The selection between 'AM' and 'PM' is done using `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`. This logic is mostly correct except for the special case when `h` is '12'. According to the 12-hour clock format, '12:XX PM' should be used for '12:XX' in 24-hour format, and '12:XX AM' should be used for '00:XX' in 24-hour format. The current implementation will print '12:XX PM' for both '00:XX' and '12:XX'.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def convert_to_12_hour_format():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h, m = s.split(':')
        hour = int(h)
        period = 'AM'
        
        if hour == 0:
            hour = 12
        elif hour == 12:
            period = 'PM'
        elif hour > 12:
            hour -= 12
            period = 'PM'
        
        print(f"{hour:02}:{m} {period}")

convert_to_12_hour_format()
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.
