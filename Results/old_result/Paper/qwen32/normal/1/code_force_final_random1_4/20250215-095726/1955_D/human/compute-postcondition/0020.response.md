Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 1; `a[i]` is in `b_values`. The current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
