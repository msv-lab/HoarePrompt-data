The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 5.
- `a` is the input string.
- `b` is the newly input string of length `n`.
- `i` is set to 5.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
