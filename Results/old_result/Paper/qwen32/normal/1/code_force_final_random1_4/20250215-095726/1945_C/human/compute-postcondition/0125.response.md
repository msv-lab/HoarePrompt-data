The code appends `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `final` initially contains `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise it is an empty list. After executing the code, `final` will definitely contain `elem` as an additional element.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` plus the newly appended `elem`; `lst` contains at least one element; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
