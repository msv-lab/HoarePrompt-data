To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases but is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `a` is an input integer. However, this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(x + y)
```

This code will print the sum of `x` and `y`, which are the counts of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, respectively.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we know that the output will be the sum of these counts.

Output: **x + y (where x is the count of occurrences of 'map' in the string s and y is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the string s)**
