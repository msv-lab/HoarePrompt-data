The given code snippet modifies the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to it. Here's the updated state:

- `s` remains a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains the length of the string `s` and is greater than 0.
- `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as they contain precomputed values and indices of '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged as they contain precomputed values and indices of '<' characters in `s`.
- `l` remains 0.
- `r` remains the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
- `a` remains `B[r]`.
- `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

Given that `l` is 0, `idx_A[l - 1]` would refer to `idx_A[-1]`, which is the last index of '>' in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1; `a` is `B[r]`; `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1)`.**
