The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state, `suf` is a list of cumulative sums from `l`, and `smin` is a list where each element is the minimum of the next element in `suf` and the current element in `smin`.

After executing the line `smin.append(suf[i + 1])`, the list `smin` will have an additional element which is `suf[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), ..., suf[i + 1]]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is i + 1`**. 

In natural language: The list `smin` now includes an additional element at the end, which is `suf[i + 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
