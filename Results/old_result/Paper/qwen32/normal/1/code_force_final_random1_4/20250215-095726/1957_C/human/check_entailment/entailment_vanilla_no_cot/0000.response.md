Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Initialization of `dp` Array**: The `dp` array is initialized with `-1`, but it should be initialized with `0` because we are calculating the number of configurations, which starts from `0`.

2. **Base Cases**: The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` seem correct, but the recurrence relation used might not be accurate for this problem.

3. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` does not correctly represent the problem's constraints. The problem involves placing rooks on a chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other, and the computer mirrors the moves. The recurrence relation needs to account for the fact that once a row and column are occupied, they cannot be used again, and the mirroring of moves adds complexity.

4. **Handling Invalid Positions**: The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied. However, it incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the set, which does not account for the fact that `r` and `c` are coordinates and should be treated differently.

5. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the constraints and the nature of the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach involving combinatorial mathematics or a different dynamic programming strategy would be required. The current implementation does not correctly handle the constraints and the mirroring of moves.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
