The given code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. This change affects the value of `ans` based on the condition provided in the initial state. Since `impossible` is now `True`, `ans` will be set to `'NO'`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is `'NO'`.**
