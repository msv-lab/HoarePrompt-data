Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10⁴. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the value of `n` for each test case.**
