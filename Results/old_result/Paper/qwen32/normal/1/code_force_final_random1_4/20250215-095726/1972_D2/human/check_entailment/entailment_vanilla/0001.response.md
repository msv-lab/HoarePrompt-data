Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Provided Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1()`
- This function reads a single test case with values \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- It iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1, ensuring that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the counter by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).

#### Function `func_2()`
- This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop logic for iterating over \(x\) and \(y\) does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` restricts the iteration space too narrowly.
   - The program assumes that \(x\) and \(y\) directly correspond to \(a\) and \(b\), but this is not necessarily true for all valid pairs.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic inside the loop is flawed. The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then all multiples of \(x\) and \(y\) will form valid pairs, which is not the case.

3. **Handling of GCD**:
   - The program only considers pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). However, the problem requires checking all pairs \((a, b)\) regardless of their GCD, as long as the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) holds.

### Conclusion
Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
