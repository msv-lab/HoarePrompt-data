The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `x` based on the expression `r - (l + 2)`. This calculation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.
