The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given the initial state, `i` is `m + 2` and `n` is greater than `m + 2`.

The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[m + 2]`) is used as a key in the dictionary `cnt_b`, and its corresponding value is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1.**
