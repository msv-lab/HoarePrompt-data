Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
