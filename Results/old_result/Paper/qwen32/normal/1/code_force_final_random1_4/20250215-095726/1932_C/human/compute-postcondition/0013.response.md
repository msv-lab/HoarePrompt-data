The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `l` depends on the value of `s[0]`: if `s[0]` is 'L', `l` starts at 1 and becomes 2; if `s[0]` is 'R', `l` starts at 0 and becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[0]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1]]`, `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing `[a[n-1], a[0]]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 2`, `i` is 3.**
