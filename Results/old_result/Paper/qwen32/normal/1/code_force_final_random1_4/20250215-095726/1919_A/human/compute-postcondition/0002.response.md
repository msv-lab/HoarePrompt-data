To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, where `_` is a throwaway variable and `t` is the number of test cases.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `results` are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
