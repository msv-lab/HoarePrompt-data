The code snippet assigns the value of the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` to the variable `y`. This means `y` now holds the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `x` is the count of occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**
