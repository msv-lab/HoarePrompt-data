The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in the integer `cur` to 1. Given the initial state, `cur` was initially 0, and the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` was not set.

After executing the code, `cur` will have its bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1. This means `cur` will now be equal to `1 << cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
