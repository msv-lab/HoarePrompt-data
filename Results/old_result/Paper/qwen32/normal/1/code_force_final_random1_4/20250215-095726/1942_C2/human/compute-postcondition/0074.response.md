Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified, `tmp` is a list of values `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` that met the second condition, and `y` is updated based on the decrement operations. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2.**
