The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]; `i` is 2**
