To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is 6
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is 8.1667 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition, it doesn't affect our decision here)

Let's evaluate the conditions with the given values:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `(1 + 3) * 1 <= 6` which is `4 <= 6` (True)
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `(1 + 3) * 3 <= 20` which is `12 <= 20` (True)

Since both conditions are true, the loop can execute again with the current values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is 6, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 8.1667**
