Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78). It then constructs and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The final state of the program is that it has processed all `t` test cases and printed the corresponding strings.**
