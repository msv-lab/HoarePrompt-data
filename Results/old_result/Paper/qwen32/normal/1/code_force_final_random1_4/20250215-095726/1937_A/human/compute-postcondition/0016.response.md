Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is calculated as `log2(n_cases)`, which is equivalent to `log2(t)`.
- `power` is initially set to `log2(t)`.
- It is also stated that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Key Observations:
- Since `n` is calculated as `log2(t)` and `power` is also set to `log2(t)`, it follows that `power` is equal to `n`.
- The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`. Given that `power` is `log2(t)`, this means `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** log2(t)`.

### Simplification:
- By the properties of logarithms and exponents, \(2^{\log_2(t)} = t\).

### Conclusion:
- Therefore, `2 ** power` simplifies to `t`.

### Final Output:
Given that `t` is the input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the print statement will output the value of `t`.

Output: **t (where t is the input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
