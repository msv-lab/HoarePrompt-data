Output State: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. `visited` now includes `neighbor`.**

Natural Language: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node. All other conditions remain the same: `current` still holds the node that was at the front of the `queue`, and `tree[current]` still has at least one more neighbor that has not been processed.
