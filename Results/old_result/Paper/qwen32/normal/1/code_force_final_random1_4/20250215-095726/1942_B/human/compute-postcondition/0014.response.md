To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop header: `i`.

The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. The loop variable `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`
- `mex` is defined based on the condition `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`
- `i` is `i - 1`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1. Therefore, to find the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Let's break it down:
- Since the loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the current value of `i` plus 1.
- No other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`) are mentioned in the loop header, so they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`, and `i` is `i + 1`**
