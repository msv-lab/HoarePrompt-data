The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` was previously updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, we need to reflect these changes in the output state.

Let's break down the changes:
- `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `L` initially empty, now contains `m`.

Since `n` is updated before `m` is calculated, we need to use the new value of `n` to determine `m`. However, the exact numerical value of `n` is not specified, so we will express `m` in terms of the updated `n`.

After the update, `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Let's denote the new value of `n` as `n_new`. Then, `m` is calculated as `(n_new + 1) // 2`.

Given that `L` was initially empty and now contains `m`, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an integer; `L` is a list containing `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`; `m` is `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.**
