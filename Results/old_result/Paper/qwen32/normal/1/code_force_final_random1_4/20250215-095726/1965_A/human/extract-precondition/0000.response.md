Precondition: **arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines for each test case. Each pair starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
