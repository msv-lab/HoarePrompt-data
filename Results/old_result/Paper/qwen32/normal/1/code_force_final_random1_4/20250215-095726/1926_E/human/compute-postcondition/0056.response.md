To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the expression inside the `print` function.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is 4
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer (value not specified, but it is relevant for the calculation)
- `L` is `[3, 1, 1]`
- `tot` is 0
- `pow` is 1
- `m` is 1
- The condition `tot < k <= tot + a` is mentioned, but `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we'll assume `a` is one of the elements in `L` (since it's the only list provided and the context suggests it).

### Expression Analysis:
The `print` statement contains the expression:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

Let's break down this expression step-by-step:

1. **`tot`**: The initial value of `tot` is 0.
2. **`pow`**: The initial value of `pow` is 1.
3. **`k`**: This is an input integer, and its value is not explicitly provided. Let's denote it as `k`.

The expression inside the `print` function can be simplified as follows:
- `2 * (k - tot) - 1`: Since `tot` is 0, this simplifies to `2 * k - 1`.
- Multiplying by `pow` (which is 1), the expression becomes `1 * (2 * k - 1)`, which further simplifies to `2 * k - 1`.

### Final Output:
The output of the `print` statement will be `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is the input integer.

Thus, the final output is described as:
Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
