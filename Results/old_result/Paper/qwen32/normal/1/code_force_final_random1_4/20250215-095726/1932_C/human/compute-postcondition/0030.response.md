Given the initial state and the operation, let's determine the new state:

- `b` contains at least one element.
- `l` is `n`.
- `r` is `-1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `[p]`.
- `p` is `v % m`.
- `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`.

The operation performed is:
```python
p = p * v % m
```

This means `p` is updated to the value of `(p * v) % m`.

Since `p` was initially `v % m` and `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`, after the operation, `p` will be `( (v % m) * v ) % m`.

Therefore, the updated value of `p` is `( (v % m) * v ) % m`.

Other variables (`b`, `l`, `r`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `[p]`, `p` is `( (v % m) * v ) % m`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`.**
