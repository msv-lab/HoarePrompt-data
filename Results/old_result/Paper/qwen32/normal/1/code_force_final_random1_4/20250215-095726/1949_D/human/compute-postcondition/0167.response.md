The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. This means that regardless of the previous conditions that determined the value of `nx`, 'F' is now added to it.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nx`. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original `nx` plus 'F'; `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n` remain unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, `nx` now has 'F' appended to its previous value, and `j` has been increased by 1. All other variables stay the same.
