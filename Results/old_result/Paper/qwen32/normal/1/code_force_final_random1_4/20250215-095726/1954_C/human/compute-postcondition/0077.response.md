To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `new` is a list constructed based on certain conditions involving `a` and `b`.
- `new2` is another list constructed similarly but using `max` instead of `min`.
- `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was not initially equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `i` remains `k`.

### Construction of `new2`:
- The first `k` elements of `new2` are the same as the first `k` elements of `a` (or `b`).
- For `i` from `k + 1` to `len(a) - 1`, the `i`-th element of `new2` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.
- If `i` is greater than `len(a) - 1`, the remaining elements of `new2` are `None`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet converts each element in the `new2` list to a string and joins them together without any separator. This means that if `new2` contains integers and `None`, they will be converted to their string representations and concatenated.

### Output Description:
- The output will be a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in `new2`.
- The first `k` elements of `new2` are directly taken from `a` or `b`, so these parts will be the same as the corresponding parts of `a` or `b` converted to strings.
- For `i` from `k + 1` to `len(a) - 1`, the elements are `max(a[i], b[i])`, so these parts will be the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` converted to strings.
- If there are any `None` values in `new2` (which would occur if `i` exceeded `len(a) - 1`), they will be represented as the string `'None'`.

### Final Output:
Given the above explanation, the output will be a string that represents the concatenated values of `new2`.

Output: **string representation of new2 (where the first k elements are from a or b, the next elements are max(a[i], b[i]) for i from k+1 to len(a)-1, and any remaining elements are None)**
