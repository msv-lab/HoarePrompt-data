Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 3; `bOnes` is increased by 1.**  
This means that the value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previously specified values.
