The given code appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. 

Given the initial state, `ad` was `[0]`. After executing the line `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])`, `ad` will now include the new element `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is `1` initially, `ad` will now be `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` where `input().split()` provides at least one integer, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the value calculated in the last iteration, `i` is `1`, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order**.
