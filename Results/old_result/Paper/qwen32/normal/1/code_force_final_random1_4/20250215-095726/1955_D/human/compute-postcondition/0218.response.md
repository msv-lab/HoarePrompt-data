The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m + 1`.

State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`**
