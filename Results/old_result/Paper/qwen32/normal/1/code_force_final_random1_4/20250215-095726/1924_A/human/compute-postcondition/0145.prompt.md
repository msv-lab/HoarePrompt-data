Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are new integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a new integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to include `ss`. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `ss`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
