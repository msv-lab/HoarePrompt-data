The code snippet `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it back to `tmp`. This means that the length of `lst[tmp]` is reduced by one, and `tmp` now holds the value of the element that was removed.

Given the initial state, `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element, so the operation is valid. After the operation, `lst[tmp]` will have one less element than before, and `tmp` will be updated to the value of the popped element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` contains all `b` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element (e.g., `[1]`). `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes all `a` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `z` is an integer read from the input. `tmp` is assigned the value of the last element of `lst[tmp]` that was popped, and `lst[tmp]` has one less element than before. `one` is False.**
