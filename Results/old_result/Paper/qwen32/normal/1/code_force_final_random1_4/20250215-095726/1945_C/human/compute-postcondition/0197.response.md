Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `final` is now `[elem]` if it was previously empty, or it now contains two `elem`s if it already contained `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains `[]`. `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0 before appending `elem`. `n`, `s`, `pk`, `_`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `elem` is the next element in `lst` after `elem_current`. `final` has been updated to include `elem`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `final` list now includes the `elem` element. If `final` was previously empty and `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` now contains just `elem`. If `final` already contained `elem` and `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` now contains two `elem` elements. The value of `c1` remains unchanged from its previous calculation if `final` was empty before this operation. All other variables retain their previous values.
