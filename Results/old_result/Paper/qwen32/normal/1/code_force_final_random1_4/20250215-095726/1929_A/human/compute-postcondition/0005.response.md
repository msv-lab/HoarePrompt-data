To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `n` is the length of the newly input list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `ntest` must be greater than 0. This variable is not mentioned in the print statement, so it does not affect the current print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Analysis:
- `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element in the list.
- `a[0]` refers to the first element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list.
- The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Output:
Output: **difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a` (where the largest element is `a[len(a) - 1]` and the smallest element is `a[0]`)**
