To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

1. **Input Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
   - `n`: An integer such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.
   - `k`: An integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5.
   - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5).
   - `a`: A list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`.
   - `b`: A list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`.

2. **Derived Lists:**
   - `ad`: Differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with 0.
   - `bd`: Differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with 0.
   - `v`: Ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`, starting with 0.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - `ql`: A newly read integer input for a query.
   - `s`: The index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` is confirmed to be equal to `ql`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(b[s], end=' ')`: This statement prints the value of `b[s]`, where `s` is the index found during the query processing.

### Explanation of the Output:

Given the initial state, the variable `s` is determined based on the binary search or similar method to find the position where `ql` would fit into the sorted list `a`. If `ql` matches an existing element in `a`, `s` will point to that element's index. The value printed is `b[s]`, which corresponds to the value in the `b` list at the same index `s`.

### Conclusion:

The output of the print statement depends on the value of `ql` and its position relative to the elements in the list `a`. Specifically, it prints the value from the `b` list at the index where `ql` would fit into the `a` list.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index in a where ql would be inserted to maintain sorted order, and if a[s] == ql, then b[s] is printed)**
