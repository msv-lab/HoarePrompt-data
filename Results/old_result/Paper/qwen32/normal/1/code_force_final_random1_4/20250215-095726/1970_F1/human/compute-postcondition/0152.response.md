Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.`**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `pos` has been assigned the value corresponding to the key `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, which represents the position of the object `obj` on the grid. All other variables retain their initial values.
