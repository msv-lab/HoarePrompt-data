Postcondition: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was the value at the end of the last iteration). If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.**
