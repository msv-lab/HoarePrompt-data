The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented by 1 previously), and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. After executing the code, the list `sa` will include the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `sa` includes the value of `i`**.
