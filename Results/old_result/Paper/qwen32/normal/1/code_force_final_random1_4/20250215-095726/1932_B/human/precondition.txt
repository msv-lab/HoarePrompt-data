t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of signs. The second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n followed by a list of n integers representing the periodicities for that test case.
