Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is 0; `k` is an integer; `L` is a list of integers representing the halved values of the original `n` until `n` becomes zero; `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The only change is that the variable `tot` is initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
