The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `suf[i]` is `suf[2]` which is `l[0] + l[1]`, and `l[i]` is `l[2]`.

Therefore, the new element appended to `suf` is `(l[0] + l[1]) + l[2]`.

Updating `suf`, it now becomes `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], (l[0] + l[1]) + l[2]]`.

The values of `t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], (l[0] + l[1]) + l[2]]`; `i` is 2**.
