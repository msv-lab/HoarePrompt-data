Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`. `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `q`, `i`) retain their previous conditions and values unless further modified by subsequent code.
