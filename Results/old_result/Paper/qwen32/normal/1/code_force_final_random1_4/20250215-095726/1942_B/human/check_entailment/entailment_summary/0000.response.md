### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and constructing the permutation `p` based on the MEX operation definition. However, there is a critical flaw in the approach used in the program.

The key point is how the MEX value is being managed. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The program initializes `mex` to `n` and then iteratively decreases it based on the values in `a`, but this approach does not correctly ensure that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in the permutation `p`.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
1. The program starts with `mex` initialized to `n`, which is incorrect because the MEX should start from 0.
2. The loop iterates from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, calculating `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
3. The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is intended to update `mex`, but it doesn't guarantee that `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `p`.

A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used numbers and updating the MEX dynamically as we construct the permutation `p`. Here's a sketch of the correct approach:
1. Initialize an empty set `used` to keep track of numbers already included in `p`.
2. Iterate through the array `a` in order.
3. For each `a[i]`, find the current MEX by checking the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
4. Calculate `p[i]` as `MEX - a[i]` and add `p[i]` to the `used` set.
5. Update the MEX accordingly.

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX and construct the permutation `p`.

### Correctness: **False**
