Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `final` is now `[elem]` if it was previously empty, or it now contains two `elem`s if it already contained `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains `[]`. `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0 before appending `elem`. `n`, `s`, `pk`, `_`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `elem` is the next element in `lst` after `elem_current`.**
