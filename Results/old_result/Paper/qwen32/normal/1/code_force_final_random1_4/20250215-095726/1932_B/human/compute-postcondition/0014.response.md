The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `year`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `year` is the final value after all iterations of the loop have completed**.
