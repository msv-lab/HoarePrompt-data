To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(test_cases):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the range defined by `test_cases`. Therefore, the only variable we need to consider adjusting is `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1. Given the problem statement, `test_cases` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), which means it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Since `test_cases` is already within the valid range and no other variables in the loop head need adjustment, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `f`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; the second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` such that 1 ≤ `m_i` ≤ 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i+1}`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
