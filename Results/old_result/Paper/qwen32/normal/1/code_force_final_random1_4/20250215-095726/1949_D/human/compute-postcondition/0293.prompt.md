You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most ⌊n/2⌋ characters in the input that are 'F' or 'S'.

    #State: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the sequence "aFbScSdSaFbScSdSaFbScSdS..." is repeated `n` times. Otherwise, a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, is created where each character is either directly from `xx[i][j-1]` or determined by the conditions involving `sb`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24) representing the number of scenarios. It also accepts an n x n matrix where each element is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the nature of the transition video between scenarios. The function returns a string indicating whether it's possible to determine if the sequence of videos can be arranged such that no two consecutive videos are both scary ('S'). If it's possible, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".
