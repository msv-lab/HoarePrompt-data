Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `cur` is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete), `cnt` is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively and `cnt` is less than n, `tmp` is `'b'` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only terminates the innermost loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values.
