The given code snippet writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. This operation does not change the values of any existing variables; it only performs an output operation.

Since the precondition specifies that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1, this condition remains unchanged as it is not related to the execution of the provided code snippet.

Output State: **The value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character is written to the standard output; `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1.**
