The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes a new integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `lis`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the new input integer (this will be overwritten)
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code snippet, `n` will be updated to the new integer input value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
