The given code snippet increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b[i]`. Since the exact value of `b[i]` before the increment is not specified, we can denote its new value as `b[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', `b[i]` is `b[i] + 1`**.
