To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, meaning it initializes any new key with a value of 0.
   - `d2` is another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the input and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is set to the value of `m`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, with the condition that if `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Computation of `d1`**:
   - `d1[k]` for `k` from 3 to `n` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
   - Specifically, `d1[k]` seems to count the occurrences of a specific difference pattern in the list `l`. However, without the exact loop logic, we can only infer that `d1[k]` holds some count related to the differences in `l`.

3. **Output Statement**:
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` computes the difference between the counts stored in `d1` for keys `y` and `x`.

Given the information, we know:
- `d1` is a dictionary that stores counts of certain differences in the list `l`.
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, with `y` being greater than `x` or equal to `x`.

However, the exact values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` depend on the contents of `l` and how `d1` is populated. Since we do not have the exact contents of `l` or the detailed loop logic that populates `d1`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the counts stored in `d1` for the keys `y` and `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a defaultdict that counts certain differences in the list l, and x and y are integers obtained from the input)**
