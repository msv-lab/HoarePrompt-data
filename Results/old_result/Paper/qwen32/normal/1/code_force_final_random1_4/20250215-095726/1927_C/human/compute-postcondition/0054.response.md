Postcondition: **`i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are the counts reflecting the conditions met during the loop iterations. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the conditions specified in the if part are met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
