Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains either {2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3} if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or {2: 1, 3: `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, 4: `l[2] - l[1] + 2`} otherwise, or {2: 1, 3: `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, 4: `l[3] - l[1] + 1`}, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
