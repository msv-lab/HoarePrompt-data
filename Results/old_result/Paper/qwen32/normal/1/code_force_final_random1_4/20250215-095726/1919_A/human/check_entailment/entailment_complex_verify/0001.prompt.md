You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns 'Bob'
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two positive integer inputs representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and returns 'Bob' if the total number of coins is even, otherwise it returns 'Alice'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 0.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is the number of iterations the loop performed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It then determines the winner based on some criteria defined in `func_1` and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each one.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start with `a` and `b` coins respectively. They take turns swapping wallets and removing one coin until one of them can't make a move. The key point here is that the game state is determined by the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:
- **func_1(a, b)**: This function determines the winner based on the sum of coins `a + b`. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
- **func_2()**: This function handles the input/output operations. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results.

### Reasoning:
The core logic of the game is captured correctly in `func_1`. The game can be analyzed as a combinatorial game where the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins determines the winner. If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position, and vice versa. This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, changing its parity. Therefore, if the initial total is even, Bob can ensure that he is the one to face an odd total when it's Alice's turn, and eventually win. Similarly, if the initial total is odd, Alice can ensure she faces an even total when it's Bob's turn, and eventually win.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
