To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step-by-step:

1. The loop iterates from the last index of `ar` to the first index (inclusive).
2. For each iteration, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
3. It then checks if `mex` should be updated to `mex - ar[i]` based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`.
4. This process continues until all elements of `ar` have been processed.

Let's summarize the final state:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is just the length of `ar`.
- `ar` remains unchanged as its elements are only read, not modified.
- `res` will be fully populated with the calculated values.
- `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that was not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.

The final output state can be described as follows:

- `res` will contain the values `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.
- `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that was not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.

Given these points, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is the list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` where each `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` for `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that was not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `res` will be filled with the differences between the current `mex` and each element of `ar` in reverse order, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that wasn't used in any of these differences.
