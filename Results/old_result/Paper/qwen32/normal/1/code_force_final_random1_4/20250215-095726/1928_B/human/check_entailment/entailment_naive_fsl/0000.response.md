Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. It only includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) that read input, convert it to different data types, or perform basic operations like calculating cumulative products. None of these functions address the task of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

To solve the problem, we need to implement a strategy that determines the best permutation to add to the array to maximize the frequency of any single element. The current code does not provide any such logic, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
