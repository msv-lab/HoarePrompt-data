Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` is an empty list; `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - j`. If `idx_B` was initially empty and the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', `B` becomes [0]. Otherwise, if the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', `B` includes a new element `x` which is calculated as `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len(idx_B)` before the append operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty; `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<'; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`; `j` is `j + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty; `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<'; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` includes the newly appended `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
