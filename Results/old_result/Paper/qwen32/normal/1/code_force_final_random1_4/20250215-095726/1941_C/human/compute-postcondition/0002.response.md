The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `s`. This means `s` will hold the string value that is input by the user. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user.**
