a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The length of the list a is equal to the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and all a_i's are pairwise different within each test case.
