The given code snippet attempts to concatenate the variable `ss` to the variable `ans`. However, the variable `ss` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming there was a typo and the intention was to concatenate `tmp` (which is an empty string) to `ans`, here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `cur` is 0.**

However, if we consider the original code with `ss` being undefined, the code would raise a NameError. Since no such error handling is mentioned, let's assume the intended variable was `tmp`.

If we proceed with the assumption that `ss` was meant to be `tmp`:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `cur` is 0.**

Since `tmp` is an empty string, concatenating it to `ans` does not change the value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
