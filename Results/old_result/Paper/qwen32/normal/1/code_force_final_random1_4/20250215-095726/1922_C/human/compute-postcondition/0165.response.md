To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: Greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. It stores differences between consecutive elements of `l` for keys from 3 to `n`.
   - `d2`: Another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. It stores differences between consecutive elements of `l` for keys from 1 to `n-1`.
   - `m`: An integer greater than 0 obtained from the input.
   - `j`: Initialized to 0.
   - `x` and `y`: A pair of integers obtained from the input. If `y > x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Relevant Calculations:**
   - `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. Specifically, `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i-1]`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`. To understand what this prints, we need to know the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

- `d2[y]` is the difference between the `y`-th and `(y-1)`-th elements of the list `l`.
- `d2[x]` is the difference between the `x`-th and `(x-1)`-th elements of the list `l`.

Thus, `d2[y] - d2[x]` represents the difference between these two differences:
\[ d2[y] - d2[x] = (l[y] - l[y-1]) - (l[x] - l[x-1]) \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the above calculation. Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and the list `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **(l[y] - l[y-1]) - (l[x] - l[x-1]) (where l is the list of integers, y is the second integer input, and x is the first integer input)**
