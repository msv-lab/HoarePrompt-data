The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ql`. This means that `ql` will now hold the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is the integer value from user input, `s` is the insertion point of the original `ql` in `a`. If `a[s]` was equal to the original `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to the original `ql` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, the state of these variables remains unchanged, `l` is 2.**
