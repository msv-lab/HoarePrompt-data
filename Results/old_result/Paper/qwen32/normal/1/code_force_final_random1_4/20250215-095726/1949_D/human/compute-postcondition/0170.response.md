Postcondition: **`nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the original `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is updated by appending 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`. The variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `n` remain unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
