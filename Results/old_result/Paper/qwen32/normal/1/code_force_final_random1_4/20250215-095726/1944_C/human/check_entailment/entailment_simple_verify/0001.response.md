Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to array `c`.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
- Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- We need to find the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

### Key Points:
- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Observations:
- Alice will try to add elements to `c` in such a way that the MEX is maximized.
- Bob will try to prevent this by removing elements that could help Alice increase the MEX.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code reads multiple test cases and processes each test case using the function `func_1(arr)`.

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: Counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - `start = 0`: Initializes the starting point to check for the MEX.
   - `vis = set()`: Keeps track of visited elements.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero, meaning there are still elements equal to `start` in `arr`.
   - `vis.add(start)`: Marks `start` as visited.
   - `nums[start] -= 1`: Decrements the count of `start` in `nums`.
   - Checks if `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is non-zero:
     - If true, it means there are still elements equal to `start + 1` in `arr`.
     - `nums[start + 1] -= 1`: Decrements the count of `start + 1` in `nums`.
     - `start += 1`: Moves to the next integer.
     - This simulates Alice and Bob picking consecutive numbers alternately.
   - If false, it means there are no more elements equal to `start + 1` in `arr`.
     - `print(start + 1)`: Prints the current `start + 1` as the MEX.
     - Returns from the function.

3. **Final Print**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a missing number, it prints `start`.
   - However, this part of the code is unreachable because the function returns inside the loop when it finds the MEX.

### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that `nums` keeps track of the counts of elements in `arr` and `start` is incremented only if both `start` and `start + 1` are present in `arr`.
- The annotations also confirm that the function correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` after the game ends.

### Correctness Check:
- The code correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` after the game ends.
- It handles the scenario where there are pairs of consecutive numbers and ensures that Alice can maximize the MEX by alternating with Bob.
- It also handles the scenario where there are no pairs of consecutive numbers and correctly identifies the smallest missing number.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the final array `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal strategies of both players.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
