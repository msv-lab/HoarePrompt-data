### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of an array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally on an array `a`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
2. **Tracking Missing Elements**: It initializes a variable `start` to `0`, which represents the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been encountered yet.
3. **Iterating Through Counts**: The program iterates through the counts of elements starting from `0`. If the current `start` value exists in the counts (`nums.get(start, 0)`), it adds `start` to a set `vis` (though `vis` is not used further) and decrements its count in `nums`.
4. **Checking Next Integer**: If the next integer (`start + 1`) also exists in the counts, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
5. **Printing the Result**: If at any point `start + 1` does not exist in the counts, the program prints `start + 1` and exits, indicating that `start + 1` is the smallest missing integer.
6. **Final Print**: If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, the program prints `start`, which would be the next integer in sequence.

This logic correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been processed, considering the optimal moves by Alice and Bob. Since the game mechanics do not affect the final MEX calculation (as both players just pick elements without affecting the MEX directly), the program's logic is sound.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the input array `arr`, adhering to the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
