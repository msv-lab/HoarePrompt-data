Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; n is greater than 2; k is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) for which res was '<', or 1 if no such i exists; best is 0; res is the value of the user's input for the last iteration; i is n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        best = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `res` is the value of the user's current input. If `res` equals `<`, then `k` is updated to the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which `res` was `<`, or 1 if no such `i` exists, and `best` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` and `best` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the value of the user's new input. If `res` equals `<`, then `best` is set to 2. Otherwise, `best` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the value of the user's new input, and `best` is 3 if `res` equals '<'. Otherwise, `best` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
