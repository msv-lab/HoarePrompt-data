Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 1, `k` is an integer, `L` is [1, 2], `pow` is 4, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is 2. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.**
