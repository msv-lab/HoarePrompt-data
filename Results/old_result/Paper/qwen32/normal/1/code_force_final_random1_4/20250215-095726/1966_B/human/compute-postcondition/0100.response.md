Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all inputs provided during the loop), `tc` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is `n` - 1, `ans` is `'YES'`. Additionally, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`.**
