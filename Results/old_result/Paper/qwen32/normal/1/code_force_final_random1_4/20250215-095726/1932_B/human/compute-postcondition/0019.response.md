The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements of the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was the current element being processed from the list `a`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `ai` should be the next element in the list. Given that `year` is the first element of the list `a`, we can infer that the previous iteration processed `year` (the first element). Therefore, for the next iteration, `ai` should be the second element of the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `year` is the first element of the list `a`, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`**
