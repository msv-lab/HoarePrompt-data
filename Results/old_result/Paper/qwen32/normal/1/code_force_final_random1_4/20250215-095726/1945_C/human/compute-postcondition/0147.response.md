The code snippet provided creates a new list `sl` by converting the input string `s` into a list of its characters. This operation does not affect any of the previously described variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `_`). 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`.**
