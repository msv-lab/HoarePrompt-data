The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the `resultats` list. 

Given the initial conditions, `resultats` could initially be either `[-1]` or `[-1, -1]` depending on the values of `total_matchs` and `p_3`, or it could be `[]` if `total_points` is even.

After the operation, the `resultats` list will have an additional element, which is the integer division of `egalites` by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple; `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, or an empty list if `total_points` is even, and now includes an additional element `egalites // 2`. `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0.**
