Output State: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 4`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by 4. The values of `x`, `n`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans` which has been recalculated.
