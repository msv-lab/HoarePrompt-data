It seems there's a discrepancy in the provided function definition and the parameter constraints. The function `func_1()` does not accept any parameters according to the given definition, but the parameter constraints mention `n` and `m`. Assuming the function should accept `n` and `m` as parameters, here is the functionality description:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value based on the relationship or computation involving `n` and `m`. However, since no specific output conditions or cases are provided, the exact return value cannot be detailed further.**
