Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is [0], `idx_B` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the character at position `i` in `s` is '<'.**

Natural Language Explanation: The only change is that the list `B` now contains the single element `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
