Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all inputs provided during the loop), `tc` is incremented by `m - 1` for all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`, `j` is `m - 2`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is `'NO'`.**

Natural Language: The variable `impossible` has been set to `True`, which changes the value of `ans` to `'NO'`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
