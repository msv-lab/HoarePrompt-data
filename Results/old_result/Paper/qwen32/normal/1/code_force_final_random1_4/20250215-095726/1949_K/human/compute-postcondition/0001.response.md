Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

Natural Language: The initial state of the variables remains unchanged except that three new empty lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are created.
