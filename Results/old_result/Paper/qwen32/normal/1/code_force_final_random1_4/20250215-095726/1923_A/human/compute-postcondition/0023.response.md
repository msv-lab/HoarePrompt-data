Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is either 0 or 1, with at least one element `a_i` equal to 1. The function returns the index (0-based) of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in the list `a` for each test case.**
