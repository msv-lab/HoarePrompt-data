Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the newly input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `zero` is the count of '0's in `s` up to the second last character; `one` is the count of '1's in `s` up to the second last character; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` for each index `i` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is a string such that `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50 (e.g., `s = "0101"`); `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `zero` is the count of '0's in `s` up to the second last character; `one` is the count of '1's in `s` up to the second last character; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` for each index `i` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, updated to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is a string such that `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50 (e.g., `s = "0101"`); `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `zero` is the count of '0's in `s` up to the second last character; `one` is the count of '1's in `s` up to the second last character; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` for each index `i` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`; `ele` is `ele_next`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is a string such that `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50 (e.g., `s = "0101"`); `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `zero` is the count of '0's in `s` up to the second last character; `one` is the count of '1's in `s` up to the second last character; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` for each index `i` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`; `ele` is `next_ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
