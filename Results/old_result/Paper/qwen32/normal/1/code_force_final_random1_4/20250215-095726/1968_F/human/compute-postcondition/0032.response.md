Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer greater than or equal to 5; `idx` is 6; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `a[6]` which is the integer value of `data[5]`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `pf[6]` which is `data[4] ^ data[5]`; `mp[data[3]]` is a list containing the integer 3; `mp[data[4]]` is a list containing the integers 3 and 5; `mp[data[4] ^ data[5]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`; `i` is 6.**
