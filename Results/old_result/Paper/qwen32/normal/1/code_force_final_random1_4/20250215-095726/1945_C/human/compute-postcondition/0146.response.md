Postcondition: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final)` is 0, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to `[0]`; otherwise, `final` is set to a list containing `n`. If `len(final)` is not 0, `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. `_` is incremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `s` is an input string. `pk` is `n / 2`. The value of `n % 2` does not affect the final state of the variables.**
