The code snippet adds the cost to change `a` at index `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) to the `total`. Therefore, `total` is updated to its previous value plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best` is 10; `v` is greater than `pos_final`; the cost to change `a` at index `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass `b` at index `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
