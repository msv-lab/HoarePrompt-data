The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The variable `i` was previously defined as `i + 1`, but since there is no initial value given for `i`, we will only focus on the changes made by the code snippet.

The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variables `a` and `b` are updated to the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `t` stays the same. The values of `a` and `b` are now the integers read from the input. The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as it was before, but since its initial value is not specified, we keep it as `i + 1`.
