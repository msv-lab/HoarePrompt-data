Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `k + 1`, `aOnes` is `X`, and `bOnes` is `Y`. If both `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, the condition in the if statement is false, indicating that it is not the case that both `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`.**
