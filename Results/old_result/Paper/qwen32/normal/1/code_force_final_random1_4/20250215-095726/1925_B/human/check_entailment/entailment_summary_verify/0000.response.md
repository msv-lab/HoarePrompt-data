To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`, and maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these difficulties.
- **Constraints**:
  - Number of test cases `t`: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
  - Difficulty `x`: \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\)
  - Number of sub-problems `n`: \(1 \leq n \leq x\)

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be split into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` or `x // i`. If so, it updates the maximum GCD found (`ans`).

### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest divisor `i` of `x` such that `(x - n * i)` is also divisible by `i` and non-negative.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Divisor Check**: The program checks divisors up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient.
2. **Feasibility Check**: For each divisor `i`, it checks if the remaining difficulty after distributing `n` parts of size `i` can still be divided evenly by `i`.
3. **Symmetric Check**: It also checks the symmetric divisor `x // i`.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided test cases and additional edge cases.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 10 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: One possible division is `[4, 2, 4]`, and the GCD is `2`.
- Program Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `1 5 5`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: The only possible division is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the GCD is `1`.
- Program Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `1 420 69`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Explanation: One possible division is `[6, 6, ..., 6]` (69 times), and the GCD is `6`.
- Program Output: `6` (Correct)

#### Additional Test Case:
- Input: `1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: The only possible division is `[1]`, and the GCD is `1`.
- Program Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Additional Test Case:
- Input: `1 100 1`
- Expected Output: `100`
- Explanation: The only possible division is `[100]`, and the GCD is `100`.
- Program Output: `100` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- **Small `x` and `n`**: The program handles small values correctly.
- **Large `x` and Small `n`**: The program handles large values of `x` efficiently by limiting the divisor check to the square root of `x`.
- **Equal `x` and `n`**: When `x == n`, the only possible division is `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, and the GCD is `1`.
- **`n == 1`**: When `n == 1`, the only possible division is `[x]`, and the GCD is `x`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying it against several test cases, including edge cases, the program appears to correctly solve the problem. The logic ensures that the GCD is maximized by checking all possible divisors and ensuring the feasibility of dividing `x` into `n` parts.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
