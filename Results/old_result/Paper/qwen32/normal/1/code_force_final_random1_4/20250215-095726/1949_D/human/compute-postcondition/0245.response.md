The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will be 'S'. The values of `i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition regarding `sb[:n // 4]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is present in the slice `sb[:n // 4]`.**
