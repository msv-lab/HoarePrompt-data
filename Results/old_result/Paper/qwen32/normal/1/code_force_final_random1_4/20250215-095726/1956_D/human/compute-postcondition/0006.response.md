To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `l` and `r` in this case. The loop iterates over each tuple `(l, r)` in the list `ops`.

Given:
- `a` is a list of integers with constraints on its length and elements.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have processed one tuple `(l, r)` from `ops`. To proceed to the next iteration, we need to consider the next tuple in the list `ops`.

Let's denote the current tuple being processed as `(l_current, r_current)`. After processing this tuple, the next tuple in the list `ops` will be `(l_next, r_next)`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `l` should be set to `l_next` and `r` should be set to `r_next`.

Since we don't have specific values for `l_next` and `r_next`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next tuple in the list `ops`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples; `l` and `r` are the next tuple in `ops`**.

To be more precise, if we assume that the current tuple is the `k`-th tuple in `ops`, then the next tuple will be the `(k+1)`-th tuple. However, without knowing the exact structure of `ops`, we can only say:

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples; `(l, r)` is the next tuple in `ops`**.
