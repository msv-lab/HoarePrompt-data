Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic Error**: The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a single test case. However, it incorrectly assumes that if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` will be satisfied for all multiples of `x` and `y`. This is not necessarily true.

2. **Range Handling**: The loops in `func_1` do not properly cover all possible values of `a` and `b` within the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]` respectively. The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are too restrictive and do not account for all valid pairs.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The program attempts to count valid pairs using `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which is incorrect. This line does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` holds. Given the constraints, an efficient approach might involve precomputing certain values or using mathematical insights to reduce the number of checks needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program that directly checks each pair `(a, b)`:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

main()
```

This solution directly checks each pair `(a, b)` and counts those that satisfy the condition. While this solution is straightforward, it may not be efficient enough for the upper constraint limits. For very large inputs, optimizations such as precomputing gcd values or using mathematical properties would be necessary.
