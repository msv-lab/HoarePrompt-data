The code appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state, `smin` initially contains only one element `[0]`. After appending `suf[i + 1]`, `smin` will now contain two elements: `[0, suf[i + 1]]`.

Since the precondition specifies that `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]` (which is `0`), the new value `suf[i + 1]` must be a negative number or zero.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]`, `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`.**
