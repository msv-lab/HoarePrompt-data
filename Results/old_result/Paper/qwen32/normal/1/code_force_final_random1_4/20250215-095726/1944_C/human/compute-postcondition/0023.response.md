The code snippet `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decreases the count of the element at index `start + 1` in the `Counter` object `nums` by 1. Given that `start` is 2, this means the count of the element at index 3 in `nums` is decreased by 1.

Since the initial state specifies that `nums` is a `Counter` object with specific conditions about the counts of elements, particularly that the count of the element at index 2 is greater than 0 and now decreased by 1, we can infer that the count of the element at index 3 was also initially greater than 0 and is now decreased by 1.

The values of `arr`, `n`, `start`, and `vis` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 2 decreased by 1, and the count of the element at index 3 decreased by 1. `start` is 2, and `vis` is `{0, 1, 2}`.**
