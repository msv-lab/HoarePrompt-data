To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n`, sorts a list of `2n` integers, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list. This sum is printed for each test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently, the final output state will be the sequence of sums calculated for each of the `t` test cases. Each sum corresponds to the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list for a particular test case.

Here's the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines, where each line contains the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the output will be a series of numbers, one for each test case, where each number is the sum of the elements at even positions in the sorted list of integers provided for that test case.
