To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 3.
- `i` is set to 3.
- `res` is the value of the user's new input.
- If `res` equals `<`, then `best` is set to 2. Otherwise, `best` retains its original value.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

From this, we can see that the following variables are involved in the print statement:
- `'?'`: A literal string.
- `k`: This variable is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, its value is unknown.
- `best`: Its value depends on the user's input (`res`). If `res` is `<`, `best` is set to 2; otherwise, it retains its original value.
- `k`: This variable appears twice in the print statement, so its value will be printed twice.
- `i`: This variable is explicitly set to 3 in the initial state.

### Output Determination:
Given that `k` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will denote it as `k`.

- `'?'`: This will be printed as is.
- `k`: This will be printed as `k` (unknown value).
- `best`: This will be either 2 if `res` is `<`, or its original value (which is also unknown from the given information).
- `k`: This will be printed as `k` (unknown value).
- `i`: This is explicitly set to 3, so it will be printed as `3`.

### Final Output:
Combining all these, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? k best k 3 (where k is an unknown value and best is 2 if res is '<', otherwise it retains its original value)**
