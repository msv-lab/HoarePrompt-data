The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Initially, `y` was 2, so now `y` is 3. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` (which is 1) and the new `y` (which is 3) is still 1. Therefore, `cnt` remains 8.1667. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is 8.1667.**
