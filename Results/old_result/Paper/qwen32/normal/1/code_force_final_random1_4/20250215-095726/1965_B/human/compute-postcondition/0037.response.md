To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
```

This line of code implies that there is a list named `ans` which contains some integers. The code converts each integer in the list `ans` to a string and then joins them into a single string separated by spaces.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` and `k` are integers with constraints 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
- `b` is the binary string representation of `n`.
- `l` is the length of `b`.
- Depending on the value of `k`, the list `ans` is set to different values:
  - If `k` equals 1, `ans` is set to `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is set to `[2, 8, 16, 32, -49, 11, 21, 2, 32, 64]`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we need to consider both possibilities for `ans`.

If `k` equals 1:
- `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`.
- Converting each element to a string and joining them results in `'2 3 4 8 16'`.

If `k` does not equal 1:
- `ans` is `[2, 8, 16, 32, -49, 11, 21, 2, 32, 64]`.
- Converting each element to a string and joining them results in `'2 8 16 32 -49 11 21 2 32 64'`.

Given these two possible states, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **The program returns either '2 3 4 8 16' if k equals 1, or '2 8 16 32 -49 11 21 2 32 64' if k does not equal 1.**
