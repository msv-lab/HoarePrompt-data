Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t-2`; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `q` is the third integer read from the input; `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`; `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`; `ad` is `[0]`; `bd` is `[0]`; `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`; `l` is `q-1`; `m` is the value calculated in the last iteration; `i` is `1`; `ql` is the value read in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`; `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t-2`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` where `input().split()` provides at least one integer, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the value calculated in the last iteration, `i` is `1`, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t-2`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the value calculated in the last iteration, `i` is 2, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t-2`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`, `bd` is `[0]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is the value calculated in the last iteration, `i` is 3, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
