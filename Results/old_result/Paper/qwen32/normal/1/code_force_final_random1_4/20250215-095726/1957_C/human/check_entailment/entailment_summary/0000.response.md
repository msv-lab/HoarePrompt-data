### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have an `n x n` chessboard.
- Players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
- Player 1 places white rooks, and Player 2 (the computer) mirrors the move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
- We need to find the number of possible final configurations after `k` moves, considering the constraints.

#### Solution Approach:
1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board without any initial moves.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For larger boards, the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to compute the values iteratively.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, read `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of initial moves).
   - Track the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks using a set `invalid`.
   - Compute the number of unoccupied rows/columns as `n - len(invalid)`.
   - Use the precomputed `dp` array to find the number of possible configurations for the remaining board, which is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no remaining positions (`n - len(invalid) == 0`), the result should be `1` (no further moves, one configuration).

#### Verification Against Example:
- For the first test case (`n=4`, `k=1` with move `(1, 2)`):
  - `invalid` set becomes `{1, 2}`.
  - Remaining positions are `4 - 2 = 2`.
  - The result is `dp[2] = 3`, which matches the expected output.
- For the second test case (`n=8`, `k=1` with move `(7, 6)`):
  - `invalid` set becomes `{7, 6}`.
  - Remaining positions are `8 - 2 = 6`.
  - The result is `dp[6] = 331`, which matches the expected output.
- For the third test case (`n=1000`, `k=4` with moves `(4, 4)`, `(952, 343)`, `(222, 333)`, `(90, 91)`):
  - `invalid` set becomes `{4, 952, 343, 222, 333, 90, 91}`.
  - Remaining positions are `1000 - 7 = 993`.
  - The result is `dp[993] = 671968183`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for different board sizes and efficiently computes the result for each test case based on the remaining unoccupied positions.

**Correctness: True**
