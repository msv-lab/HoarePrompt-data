Postcondition: **`t` remains 3; `n` is 0; `k` remains the second integer from the input; `L` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`; `pow` is 1; `m` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. Otherwise, there is no change to `tot`.**
