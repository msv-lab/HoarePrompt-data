The given Python code snippet initializes a dictionary `lst` using `defaultdict(list)`. This means that `lst` is now a dictionary where each key's default value is an empty list. None of the other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree structure, `u_1`, `x`, `y`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
