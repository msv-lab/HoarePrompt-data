The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `k`, regardless of the value of `res`. Therefore, `k` will now hold the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` remains greater than 2, and `res` retains its value (either `<` or something else). The value of `i` is updated from `i_prev + 1` to just `i`, and `k` is set to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `res` is the new input string; `k` is equal to `i`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
