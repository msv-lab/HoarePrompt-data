The given code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from its current value. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `B[r]`; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been updated to be the difference between its original value (`A[l - 1]`) and `A[l - r - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
