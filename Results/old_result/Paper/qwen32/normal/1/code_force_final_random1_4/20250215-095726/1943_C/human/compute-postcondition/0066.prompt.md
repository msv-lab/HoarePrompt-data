Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` followed by the newly appended tuple `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `1 <= k + 2 < len(path_ba) - c1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` followed by the newly appended tuple `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `k + 4` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `1 <= k + 4 < len(path_ba) - c1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
