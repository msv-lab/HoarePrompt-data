Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` is 200001.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + 2 * int(j)`.
- `i` is 5.

Code Snippet:
```python
pd[i] += int(j)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`. Since `i` is 5, `pd[5]` should be the sum of the digits of 5, which is 5.
- `j` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume `j` is a variable that holds some integer value. However, since `j` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. But the operation `pd[i] += int(j)` indicates that `pd[5]` will be updated by adding the integer value of `j` to it.

Since `pd[5]` was initially 5 (sum of the digits of 5), after executing `pd[5] += int(j)`, `pd[5]` will be `5 + int(j)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + 2 * int(j)` and `pd[5]` being `5 + int(j)`, `i` is 5.**
