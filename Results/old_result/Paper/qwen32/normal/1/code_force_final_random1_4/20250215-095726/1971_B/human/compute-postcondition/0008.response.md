The code sorts the characters in the string `s` and assigns the sorted string to the variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is the string `s` sorted alphabetically.**
