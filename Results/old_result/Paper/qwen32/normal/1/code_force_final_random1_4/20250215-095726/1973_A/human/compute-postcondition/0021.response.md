Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p2) - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p1)`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop shown in the given context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
