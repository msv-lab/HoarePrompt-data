Postcondition: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`. If the character at position `j-1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the character at position `j-1` in `x` is not 'F'.**
