The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 5, `i + 1` equals 6. Therefore, the list `lst` will have 6 appended to it.

Let's consider the possible initial states of `lst`:
- If `lst` was initially `[0, 5]`, after appending 6, it becomes `[0, 5, 6]`.
- If `lst` was initially `[5, 5]`, after appending 6, it becomes `[5, 5, 6]`.

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 5; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` remains the same; `one` is set to 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and set to 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'; `lst` is `[0, 5, 6]` or `[5, 5, 6]` depending on its initial state; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 6`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 6)`; `i` is 5.**
