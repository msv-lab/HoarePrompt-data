Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `k`, a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns different lists as follows:

- Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
- Case_2: If `k` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, the function returns a list `l` that contains integers from 1 to `n-1` with `n` inserted at position `-k` from the end of the list.
- Case_3: If `k` equals `n`, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n` and is followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` in ascending order.
- Case_4: If `k` is greater than `n` and less than 2*n-1, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2`, with `n-1` inserted at position `-k` from the end of the list.
- Case_5: If `k` equals 2*n-1, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 2 to `n-1`. If `n` equals 1, the list contains only `[n-1]`.
- Case_6: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2*n-1 and `n` equals 1, the function returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it returns `[n-1]` if `n` is greater than 1.**
