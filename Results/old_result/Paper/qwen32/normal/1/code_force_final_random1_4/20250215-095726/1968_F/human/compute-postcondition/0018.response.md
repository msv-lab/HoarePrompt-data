Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 4, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
