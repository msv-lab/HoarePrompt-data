The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `array`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, while `l` was an input integer and is not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
