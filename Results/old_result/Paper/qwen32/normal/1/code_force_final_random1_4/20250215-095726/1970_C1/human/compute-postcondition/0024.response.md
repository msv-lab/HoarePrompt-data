The given code snippet modifies the `tmp` variable by popping the last element from the list associated with the key `tmp` in the `lst` dictionary. This means that the length of `lst[tmp]` will decrease by one.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `tmp` is reassigned to the value of the last element that was popped from `lst[tmp]`.
- The list `lst[tmp]` loses its last element.

Given the initial state, `lst[tmp]` is not empty, so the pop operation will succeed, and `tmp` will take on the value of the last element of `lst[tmp]`. The list `lst[tmp]` will now have one less element than it did before.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` contains all `b` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element (e.g., `[1]`). `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes all `a` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `z` is an integer read from the input. `tmp` is assigned the value of the last element of `lst[tmp]` that was popped. `one` is True. Additionally, `lst[tmp]` is not empty unless it became empty due to the pop operation.**
