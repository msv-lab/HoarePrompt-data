To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `j` and `t`.

Given:
- The loop is `for j in range(t):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `smin` is updated to `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`.
- `sm` is updated based on its original value.

Since the loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.

Therefore, if `j` was some value `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `t` does not change.

State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is updated based on its original value, `j` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same**.

To put it more concretely, if `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. The state would look like:

State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is updated based on its original value, `j` is 3, `t` remains the same**.

Generalizing this, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is updated based on its original value, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same**.
