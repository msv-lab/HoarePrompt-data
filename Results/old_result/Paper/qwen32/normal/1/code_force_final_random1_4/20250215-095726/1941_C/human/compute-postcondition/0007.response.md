The code snippet `a = int(input())` assigns a new integer value to the variable `a` based on the user's input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `a` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the string input by the user; `x` is the count of occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**
