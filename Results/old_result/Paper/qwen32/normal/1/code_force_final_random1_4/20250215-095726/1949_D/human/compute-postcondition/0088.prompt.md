Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24; The input consists of `n` lines, each containing `n` characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most ⌊`n`/2⌋ characters in the input that are 'F' or 'S'; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` arrays are updated based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the string `x` from positions 1 to `n`; `xx` includes the string `x` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the new input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the cumulative counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` up to each position, `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
