Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.**

Natural Language: The value of `mn` is calculated as the smaller of `a` and `b` added to `m`. All other variables retain their initial values.
