The given code snippet increments the score for a specific team by 1. Here's the updated state:

- `points[team]` is incremented by 1, meaning the score for the team identified by `team` increases by 1.
- All other variables retain their previous values as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary; `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`; `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`; `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`; `points[team]` is incremented by 1.**
