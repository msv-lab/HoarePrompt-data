The code snippet provided increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `pd[4]` is 7. The new value of `pd[4]` will be `7 + int(j)`. Since the value of `j` is not specified, we will represent the new value of `pd[4]` as `7 + int(j)`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + int(j)`, `i` is 4**.
