The given code snippet only initializes `d2` as a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This means that `d2` will now be an empty dictionary where accessing a non-existent key will automatically create that key with a default value of 0.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer obtained from the input, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
