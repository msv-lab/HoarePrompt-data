To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is greater than 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`.

Code Snippet:
```python
c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`. The function `func_1` returns two values which are assigned to `c` and `d`.

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can express them in terms of the function's output.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is greater than 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`**.

In simpler terms, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, while `c` and `d` are set to whatever values `func_1` returns when called with `b` and `a % b` as arguments.
