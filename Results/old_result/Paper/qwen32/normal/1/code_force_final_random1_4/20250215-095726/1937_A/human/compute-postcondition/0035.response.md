To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `n_cases` is set to the value of `t`.
3. `i` is initialized to 1.
4. `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer provided by the user.
5. `power` is set to the value of `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **User Input**: The value of `n` is derived from the base-2 logarithm of an integer provided by the user. Let's denote this integer as `x`. Therefore, `n = log2(x)`.
2. **Variable Assignment**: `power` is assigned the value of `n`, so `power = log2(x)`.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement calculates `2 ** power`. Since `power = log2(x)`, this expression simplifies to `2 ** log2(x)`.
4. **Mathematical Simplification**: By the properties of logarithms, `2 ** log2(x)` is equal to `x`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `x` that the user provided, because `2 ** log2(x)` simplifies back to `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **x (where x is the integer provided by the user)**
