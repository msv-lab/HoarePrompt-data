The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. This means that the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is reduced by one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` and `n` are integers.
- `n` is greater than `m`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
- If `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.

The only change introduced by the code snippet is the decrement of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`. No other variables are directly modified by this line.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**
