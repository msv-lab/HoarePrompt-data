The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `cur` is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete), `cnt` is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively and `cnt` is less than n. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is `'b'` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
