The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. This means that if `a[i]` was already a key in `cnt_b`, its value (count) is increased by 1. If `a[i]` was not a key in `cnt_b`, it is added as a key with a value of 1.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `b_values` remain unchanged except for `cnt_b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `i` is incremented by 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
