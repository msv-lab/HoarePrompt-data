### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Setup**: We have an `n x n` chessboard. Players alternate placing white and black rooks.
2. **Rules**:
   - No two rooks can attack each other (same row or column).
   - Player 1 places a white rook at `(r, c)`, then Player 2 places a black rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - The game continues until no more valid moves can be made.
3. **Objective**: Determine the number of distinct final configurations after `k` initial moves, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)`: Sets the recursion limit to handle large inputs.
   - `dp = [-1 for _ in range(300007)]`: Initializes a dynamic programming array to store results for different board sizes.
   - `func_1(300000)`: Precomputes the number of configurations for board sizes up to 300,000 using dynamic programming.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Function (`func_1`)**:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: Base case for a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Base case for a 2x2 board.
   - Loop from 3 to `n`:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`: Recurrence relation to compute the number of configurations for board size `i`.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads `n` (board size) and `k` (number of initial moves).
     - Reads `k` pairs `(r, c)` representing the initial moves.
     - Uses a set `invalid` to track rows and columns that are already occupied.
     - Computes the number of remaining valid positions as `n - len(invalid)`.
     - Outputs `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` as the number of distinct final configurations.

#### Verification:
- The dynamic programming approach seems correct for computing the number of configurations for a board with `m` remaining valid positions.
- The base cases and recurrence relation appear to match the problem constraints.
- The use of a set to track invalid positions ensures that we correctly account for the initial moves and their mirrored counterparts.
- The final output uses `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` to handle cases where no valid moves remain.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently computes the number of distinct final configurations using dynamic programming and handles the constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
