To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the list `lst`. The loop iterates through each element `elem` in `lst` and checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`. If it does, `elem` is added to the `final` list.

After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`. The value of `mini` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is determined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.

Here's the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` retains its initial value as the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The `final` list contains all elements from `lst` that have this smallest absolute difference with `pk`.
