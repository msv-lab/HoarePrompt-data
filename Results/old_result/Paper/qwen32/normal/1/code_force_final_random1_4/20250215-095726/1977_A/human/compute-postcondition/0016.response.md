The initial state provides several conditions about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables directly. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers with specific constraints: `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and both `m` and `n` are odd.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **Yes**
