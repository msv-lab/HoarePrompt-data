Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 4`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 4])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 3])` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])` and also `a[n + 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[i - 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list that includes `i`; `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `pf[i]` has been updated to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
