Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `test_cases`: Remains unchanged (not relevant to the current print statement).
   - `t`: Remains unchanged (not relevant to the current print statement).
   - `feat`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
     - `n` is the first element of `feat`.
     - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
     - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
     - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
   - `arr`: A new list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.
   - `array2`: Contains elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement does not depend on any of the variables or lists defined in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **No**
