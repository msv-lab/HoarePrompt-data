The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i_old` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is `i_old + 1`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
