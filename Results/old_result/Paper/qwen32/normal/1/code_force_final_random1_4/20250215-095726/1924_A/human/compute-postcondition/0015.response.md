The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the string `ss` to the existing string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was an empty string, and `ss` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

After executing the code, `ans` will now hold the value of `ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m (where m >= 1) consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet, `cur` is 0.**
