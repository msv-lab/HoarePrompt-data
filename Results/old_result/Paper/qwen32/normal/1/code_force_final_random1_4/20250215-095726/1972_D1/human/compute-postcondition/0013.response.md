Output State: **The program returns `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, `n` and `m` are positive integers returned by `func_7()`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` for the last valid `i`.**

This means the final value returned is one less than the calculated sum of the expression `(n + j) // (j * j)` evaluated for each `j` from 1 up to `i - 1`.
