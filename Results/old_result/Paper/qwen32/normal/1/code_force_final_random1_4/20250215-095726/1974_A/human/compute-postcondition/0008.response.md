To determine the value of `z` that will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `m` is calculated as `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.
   - `z` is determined by two conditions:
     - If `m` is not less than `a`, then `z = (y + 1) // 2`.
     - Otherwise, `z = (y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`.

2. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated based on `y` as `m = 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.
   - This formula involves integer division (`//`), which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number.

3. **Determination of `z`:**
   - First, calculate `m`.
   - Compare `m` with `a`.
     - If `m >= a`, then `z` is simply `(y + 1) // 2`.
     - If `m < a`, then `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`.

Let's summarize the logic for `z`:
- `z` is primarily `(y + 1) // 2`.
- If `m < a`, an additional term `(x - m + 14) // 15` is added to `z`.

Given the complexity of the expression for `m` and the dependency on `x` and `y`, the exact numerical value of `z` cannot be determined without specific values for `x`, `y`, and `a`. However, we can describe `z` precisely based on the given conditions.

### Final Output Description:
- If `m = 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.
- If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`.

Output: **z (where z is (y + 1) // 2 if m >= a; otherwise, z is (y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15, with m = 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4)**
