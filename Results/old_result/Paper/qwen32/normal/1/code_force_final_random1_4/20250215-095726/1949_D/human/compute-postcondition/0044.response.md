To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is the input string.
- `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element.
- `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`.
- If the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
- If the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can infer that `j` is the loop variable that starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, say `k`, and since the loop increments `j` by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration), we can generalize it to:
State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

But to match the format of the previous examples, we'll use `j` directly:
State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Since `j` is incremented by 1, if `j` was at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `j + 1` for the next iteration.

So the final answer is:
State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

But to be specific about the increment, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can just say `j` is incremented by 1:

State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Given the format, the most accurate representation would be:
State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

But to match the format exactly:
State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

So the final answer is:
State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
