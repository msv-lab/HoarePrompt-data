Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t` is decremented by 1**: This means that `t` was originally some value, and it has been decreased by 1. However, the exact value of `t` before or after this operation is not relevant to the print statement.
2. **`n` is greater than 1**: This tells us that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
3. **`a` and `b` are strings input by the user**: These are string variables that hold user-provided values. However, their specific values are not used in the print statement.
4. **`i` is the next odd number less than `n`**: This indicates that `i` is an odd integer that is the largest odd number smaller than `n`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output does not depend on the values of these variables.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided initial state and the print statement, the output will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
