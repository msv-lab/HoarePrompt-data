Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input; `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its previous value; `tmp` contains an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ii` is unchanged; `y` is decreased by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) - 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` is reduced by the expression `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
