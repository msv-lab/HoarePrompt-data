To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `l` and `r` and prints values based on the conditions provided. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap
- `s`: A string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n`: The length of the string `s`.
- `A`: Computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A`: Indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B`: Computed values based on the positions of '<' in `s`.
- `idx_B`: Indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `l`: Initially 0.
- `r`: Number of '<' characters in `s`.

### Loop Behavior
- For each character in `s`:
  - If the character is '>', `l` is incremented.
  - If the character is '<', `r` is decremented.
  - Depending on the values of `l` and `r`, specific computations are performed to update `a` and `b`, and a value is printed.

### Final Output State Analysis
The loop will iterate `n` times, once for each character in `s`. After all iterations, `l` will equal the number of '>' characters in `s`, and `r` will be 0 (since it starts as the number of '<' characters and decrements for each '<' encountered).

### Key Observations
- When `r` becomes 0, the behavior of the loop changes significantly because `r` is used in several calculations.
- The final output depends on the sequence of '<' and '>' characters in `s`.

### Example Calculation
Let's assume `s = "><><"`. Here, `n = 4`, `l` starts at 0, and `r` starts at 2 (since there are two '<' characters).

1. **First Iteration (i=0)**: `s[0] = '>'`
   - `l` becomes 1.
   - Since `l < r`, compute `a` and `b` and print a value.

2. **Second Iteration (i=1)**: `s[1] = '<'`
   - `r` becomes 1.
   - Since `l <= r`, compute `a` and `b` and print a value.

3. **Third Iteration (i=2)**: `s[2] = '>'`
   - `l` becomes 2.
   - Since `l >= r`, compute `a` and `b` and print a value.

4. **Fourth Iteration (i=3)**: `s[3] = '<'`
   - `r` becomes 0.
   - Since `r == 0`, compute `a` and `b` and print a value.

### Final State
After all iterations, `l` will be the number of '>' characters in `s`, and `r` will be 0. The exact printed values depend on the specific sequence of '<' and '>' characters in `s`.

### Conclusion
The final output state is characterized by `l` being the count of '>' characters and `r` being 0. The printed values are determined by the specific logic within the loop based on the sequence of '<' and '>' characters.

Output State: **`l` is the number of '>' characters in `s`, `r` is 0, and the printed values are based on the specific sequence of '<' and '>' characters in `s`.**
