After carefully analyzing the provided program and comparing it against the problem description, I have identified several issues that suggest the program is not fully correct.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incomplete Handling of Pinball Movement:**
   - The program uses complex logic involving arrays `A` and `B` to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. However, this logic seems overly complicated and may not accurately simulate the pinball's movement for all possible scenarios.
   
2. **Incorrect Index Handling:**
   - The program uses indices `l` and `r` to track positions in arrays `A` and `B`, but these indices are not managed correctly, leading to potential out-of-bounds errors or incorrect calculations.
   
3. **Lack of Simplicity:**
   - The problem can be solved more straightforwardly by simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position. The provided solution appears to attempt an optimized approach that might not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
<><><
```
Expected Output:
```
1 4 7 10 13
```
Explanation:
- For the first position, the pinball moves left and leaves the grid in 1 second.
- For the second position, the pinball moves right, then left, and so on, eventually leaving the grid in 4 seconds.
- This pattern continues for each position.

However, the provided program does not produce the expected output for this case, indicating that it fails to handle certain configurations correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the failure of the program on the provided example case, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
