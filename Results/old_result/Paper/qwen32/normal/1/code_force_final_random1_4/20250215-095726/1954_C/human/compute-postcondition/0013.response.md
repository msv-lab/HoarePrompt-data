The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a non-empty list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer, where `a[0] == b[0]` and `a[1] == b[1]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]` and `new[1]` is `a[1]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]` and `new2[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`; `i` is 2**
