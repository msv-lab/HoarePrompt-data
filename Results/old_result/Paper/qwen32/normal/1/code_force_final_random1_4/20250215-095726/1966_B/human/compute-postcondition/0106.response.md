The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement `for j in range(m - 1):`, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 0. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop's condition or iteration mechanism.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all inputs provided during the loop), `tc` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `i` is `n` - 1, `ans` is `'YES'`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`, `j` is 1. Additionally, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first sublist in `gr`, or the first element of the last sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last sublist in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
