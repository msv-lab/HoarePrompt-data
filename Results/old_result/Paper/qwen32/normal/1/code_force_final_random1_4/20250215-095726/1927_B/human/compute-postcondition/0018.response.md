The given code snippet reverses the `array` and assigns the reversed list to `rev_array`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is the integer input by the user, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list of `l` characters where each character is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for j in range(l) based on the new `rev_array`.**

In simple terms, `rev_array` is now the reverse of `array`, while all other variables retain their original values.
