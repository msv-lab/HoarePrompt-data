To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. For keys `k` from 3 to `n`, `d1[k]` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
   - `d2`: Another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. For keys `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `d2[i]` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` as described in the loop.
   - `m`: An integer obtained from the input, and it must be greater than 0.
   - `j`: Set to the new value of `m`.
   - `x` and `y`: A pair of integers obtained from the input, where `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d2`:**
   - `d2` is populated in a loop based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
   - Specifically, `d2[i]` seems to store cumulative differences starting from the beginning of the list up to the `i`-th element.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` computes the difference between the cumulative differences up to indices `y` and `x` in the list `l`.

Given the above, the output of the print statement will be the difference between the cumulative differences stored in `d2` at indices `y` and `x`. Since `y \leq x`, this difference represents the sum of the differences between the elements of `l` from index `y+1` to `x`.

### Explanation of the Output:
- `d2[y]` is the cumulative difference from the start of the list up to index `y`.
- `d2[x]` is the cumulative difference from the start of the list up to index `x`.
- Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` gives the sum of the differences between the elements of `l` from index `y+1` to `x`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **the sum of the differences between the elements of `l` from index `y+1` to `x` (where `l` is the list of integers, and `y` and `x` are the input integers with `y <= x`)**
