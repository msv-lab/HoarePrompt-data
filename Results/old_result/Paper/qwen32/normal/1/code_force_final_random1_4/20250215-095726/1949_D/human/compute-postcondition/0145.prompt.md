Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the original `nx` plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` has the character `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` has an additional 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to include `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` has `'F'` appended to its original value if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`; otherwise, `'S'` is appended to `nx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
