Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `current_year` is 0; `next_year` is undefined; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the second element in the list `a`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the third element in the list `a`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
