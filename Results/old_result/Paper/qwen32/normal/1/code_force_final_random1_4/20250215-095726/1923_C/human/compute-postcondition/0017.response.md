Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `x` is an integer, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, `i` is the next element in `l` after `x` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `p` has been updated by appending `i` to it, making `p` now `[0, i, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
