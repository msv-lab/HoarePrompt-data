The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The value of `i` is `i + x_next_next` from the initial state. The values of `x`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged except for `i` being used in the append operation. Since `p` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it exists and is a list.

Output State: **`x` is `x_next_next`; `i` is `i + x_next_next`; `j` is unchanged; `p` contains the new element `i + x_next_next`.**
