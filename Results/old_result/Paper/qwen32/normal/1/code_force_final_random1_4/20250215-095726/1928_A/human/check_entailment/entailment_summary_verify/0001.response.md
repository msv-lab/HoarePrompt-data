### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Bob can form a new rectangle from the two smaller rectangles he gets after cutting the original rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. Here's why:
- If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one dimension being 1, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, we can always cut the rectangle in such a way that we get two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense. It seems like an attempt to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the tuple construction `(a - b == -a, a)` is not a valid way to do that.
   
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition checks if `a` and `b` are not equal, but it does not correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed. It should instead check if at least one of `a` or `b` is even.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program should simply check if either `a` or `b` is even and print 'yes' if true, otherwise print 'no'.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'yes' if either both `a` and `b` are even, or if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

#### Analysis of Function Summary:
- The summary mentions checking if both `a` and `b` are even, which is correct.
- It also mentions checking if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, which is not necessary for the problem. The key point is whether at least one of the dimensions is even.

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided code, the program is incorrect. The logic does not properly reflect the requirement that at least one of the dimensions must be even to form a new rectangle.

**Final: False**
