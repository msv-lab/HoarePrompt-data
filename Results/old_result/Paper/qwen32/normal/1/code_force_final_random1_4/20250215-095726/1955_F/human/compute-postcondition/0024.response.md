Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p_1` is the first element of `a`, `p_2` is the second element of `a` if it exists, `p_3` is the third element of `a` if it exists, `p_4` is the fourth element of `a` if it exists, `x` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**

Natural Language: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the floor division of `x` by 2 to it. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
