The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 0, but its specific value is not relevant to this operation. The lists `suf` and `l` are modified by appending a new element to `suf`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `suf` has a new element appended which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.**
