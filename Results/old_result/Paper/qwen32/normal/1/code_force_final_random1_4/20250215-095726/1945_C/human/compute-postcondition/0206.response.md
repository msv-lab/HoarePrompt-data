The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list and remains sorted in ascending order, after appending `n`, `final` will contain one element, which is `n`. The value of `c1` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing `[n]` and remains sorted in ascending order; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50.**
