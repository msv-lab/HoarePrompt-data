### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \) equals \( k \). The Manhattan value is always even, so if \( k \) is odd, no such permutation exists.

#### Key Points:
1. **Permutation**: An array of \( n \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Manhattan Value**: Sum of \( |p_i - i| \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
3. **Constraints**: \( 1 \le n \le 2 \times 10^5 \), \( 0 \le k \le 10^{12} \).

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **func_4()**:
   - Reads \( n \) and \( k \) from input.
   - Checks if \( k \) is odd. If yes, returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value is always even.
   - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
     - For odd \( n \): \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - For even \( n \): \( \frac{n^2}{2} \)
   - If \( k \) exceeds this maximum, returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, returns `(n, k)`.

   **Issue Identified**: The formula for the maximum Manhattan value is incorrect. The correct formula is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), which applies to both odd and even \( n \). This is because the maximum deviation occurs when the permutation is reversed, leading to \( |n-1| + |n-2| + \ldots + |1-n| \).

2. **func_1(n, k)**:
   - Divides \( k \) by 2.
   - Initializes a list `l` with elements from 1 to \( n \).
   - Iterates from \( n \) down to 1 in steps of -2.
   - Adjusts `l` to increase the Manhattan value until it reaches \( k \) or determines that it's impossible.

3. **func_2(c, k, l)**:
   - Swaps elements in `l` to adjust the Manhattan value by \( k \).

4. **func_3(c, l)**:
   - Swaps elements in `l` to adjust the Manhattan value by \( c \).

5. **func_5(l)**:
   - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

6. **func_6()**:
   - Calls `func_4()` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0, prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, calls `func_1(n, k)` to get the permutation and prints it using `func_5(l)`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**:
  - The formula used in `func_4()` is incorrect. The correct formula is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
  - This affects the decision-making process in `func_4()`, leading to incorrect results when \( k \) is compared against the wrong maximum value.

- **Adjusting the Permutation**:
  - The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is intended to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
  - However, without a clear explanation or proof, it's challenging to verify that these functions always produce a valid permutation with the exact Manhattan value \( k \).

Given the identified issue with the maximum Manhattan value calculation and the lack of clear proof for the correctness of the adjustment logic, the program is likely incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
