Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, and `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` if `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged. `i` is 2.**
