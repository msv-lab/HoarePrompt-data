The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and an even integer `k`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to select exactly `k/2` elements from each list such that the selected elements are unique and common between the lists up to `k/2` times. It prints 'yes' if such a selection is possible, otherwise 'no'.
