The code snippet concatenates the string `'aa'` with the character from the `alphabet` string at the index `n - 3` and assigns this new string to the `word` variable. The variables `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Since `n` is the user input and `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, the character added to `word` will be the one at position `n - 3` in the alphabet string. For example, if `n` is 4, the character at index `4 - 3 = 1` in the alphabet string is `'b'`. Therefore, `word` would become `'aab'`.

Given the initial state, the updated state of `word` will be `'aa'` followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
