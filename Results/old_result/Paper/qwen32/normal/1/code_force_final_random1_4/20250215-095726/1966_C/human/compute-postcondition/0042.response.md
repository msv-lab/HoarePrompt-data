Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 0; `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-1`; `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`; `n` is the length of `arr` minus one and must be greater than 1.`**

Explanation: The value of `tc` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
