The code snippet `i = n - 1 - j` assigns a new value to the variable `i`. The value of `i` is now `n - 1 - j`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1 - j`.**
