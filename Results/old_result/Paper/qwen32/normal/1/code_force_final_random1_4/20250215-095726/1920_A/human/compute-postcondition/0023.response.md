Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is now equal to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged; `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3; otherwise, `num` is an empty list; `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
