The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 4, the value `5` is appended to `lst`.

Therefore, the updated state of `lst` will depend on its previous state:
- If `lst` was initially `[i + 1]` (which means `[5]`), after appending `5` again, `lst` becomes `[5, 5]`.
- If `lst` was initially `[0]`, after appending `5`, `lst` becomes `[0, 5]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` remains the same; `one` is set to 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and set to 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'; `lst` is `[0, 5]` or `[5, 5]` depending on its initial state; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 5`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`; `i` is 4.**
