Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

### Analysis of the Program

#### Function Definition and Call
The program starts with `func_1()` before defining the function `func_1`. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because the function is called before it is defined. This is a clear issue.

#### Handling of Hours
- **When `h == '00'`**: The program correctly prints `'12'`.
- **When `int(h) <= 12`**: The program correctly prints `h`.
- **When `int(h) > 12`**: The program attempts to print the hour by subtracting 12 and prefixing with '0'. However, there are a few issues:
  - If `h` is '13', it will print `'01'` which is correct in terms of the value but might need a check to ensure it prints `'01'` consistently.
  - More importantly, the logic does not account for the correct formatting of the hour. It should ensure that the hour is always printed with two digits (e.g., `'01'` instead of `'1'`).

#### AM/PM Selection
- The selection between 'AM' and 'PM' is done using `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`. This logic is mostly correct except for the special cases:
  - When `h` is `'12'`, it should print `'12:XX PM'`.
  - When `h` is `'00'`, it should print `'12:XX AM'`.

### Correctness Evaluation

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program. Here are the key points:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The program incorrectly calls the function before its definition, resulting in a `NameError`.
2. **Handling of Hours**: The program does not ensure that the hour is always printed with two digits, especially after converting from 24-hour to 12-hour format.
3. **AM/PM Selection**: The program does not handle the special cases for `'12'` and `'00'` correctly.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
