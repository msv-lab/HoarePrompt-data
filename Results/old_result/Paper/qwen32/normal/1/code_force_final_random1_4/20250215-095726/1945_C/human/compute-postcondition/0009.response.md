The code snippet converts the string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns this list to the variable `sl`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `pk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.**
