To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is greater than 0.
- `a` is less than `b`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Code Snippet:
```python
return d, c
```

From the code snippet, we know that the function returns the values `d` and `c` in that order. However, since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. We only know that they are the results of `func_1(b, a)`.

Given this information, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The program returns the values `d` and `c`, which are the results of `func_1(b, a)` in that order.**
