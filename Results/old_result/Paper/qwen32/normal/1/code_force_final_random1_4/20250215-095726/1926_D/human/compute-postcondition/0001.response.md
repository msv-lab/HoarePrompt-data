Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `res` is 0; `count` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The variable `count` has been initialized as an empty dictionary. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `res`) retain their initial values as no changes were made to them by the provided code snippet.
