The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing value of the variable `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we can only determine that `nx` will now include 'S' appended to whatever its previous value was. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is its previous value plus 'S'**.
