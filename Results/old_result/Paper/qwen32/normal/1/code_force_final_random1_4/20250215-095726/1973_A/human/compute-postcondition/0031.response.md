To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. These variables are being iterated over from the list `cas_de_test`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples.
- `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`.
- `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
- `total_matchs` is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
- `egalites` is recalculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` includes `egalites // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next tuple in the list `cas_de_test`.

Let's denote the next tuple in the list as `(next_p1, next_p2, next_p3)`. The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`**.

Note that `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`, and `resultats` are recalculated within the loop based on the new values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, so they do not need to be adjusted here.
