The code snippet provided updates the value of `total_points` by recalculating it using the current values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Since `total_points` is initially defined as `next_p1 + next_p2 + next_p3`, and now it is being reassigned to `p1 + p2 + p3`, the new value of `total_points` will be the sum of the current values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Given that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are reassigned from `next_p1`, `next_p2`, and `next_p3` respectively, the new `total_points` will be the same as the previously calculated `total_points` unless the values of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` have changed between their initial assignment and the reassignment in the code snippet.

Since no other variables are modified in the given code snippet, the rest of the variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p2) - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `next_p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, or an empty list if `total_points` is even, and now includes an additional element `egalites // 2`.**
