### Reasoning:
To solve this problem optimally, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values obtained from pairs of integers chosen from the list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the provided program works correctly:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program starts by sorting the list of integers. Sorting ensures that when we pair the smallest available integers together, we are maximizing the sum of the minimums.

2. **Pairing Strategy**: By iterating through the sorted list with a step of 2 (`for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), the program effectively pairs the smallest integer with the next smallest integer, the third smallest with the fourth smallest, and so on. This strategy ensures that we always pick the smallest possible value in each pair, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of the minimums.

3. **Summing the Minimums**: Since the list is sorted, `l[i]` will always be the smaller of the pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`. Therefore, adding `l[i]` to the score in each iteration of the loop gives us the maximum possible score.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The outer loop (`for _ in range(int(input()))`) handles multiple test cases by repeating the process for each set of input values.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to find the maximum final score by always pairing the smallest available integers together and summing the minimums of these pairs.
