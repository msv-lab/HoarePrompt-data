This function does not have any parameters in its signature. It relies on other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) which are not defined in the provided code snippet. However, based on the usage, `func_10()` likely returns the number of test cases (t), and `func_14()` likely processes each test case to determine the required sequence and its size.
