Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` contains all `b` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes all `a` values appended to its list for each pair (a, b) read during the loop iterations.`**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state remains the same as described in the initial conditions, except that the `lst` and `rev` dictionaries will have been updated to include all the pairs `(a, b)` that were read during the loop's execution. The variable `x` indicates how many times the loop ran, and `y` remains unchanged. The structure of the tree and the initial placement of the stone are not altered by the loop.
