You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
- We have `n` monsters, each with a specific health (`a_i`) and position (`x_i`).
- Every second, we can shoot up to `k` bullets at any monsters, reducing their health by 1.
- After shooting, any monster with health 0 or less dies.
- Then, all living monsters move one step closer to the player (position 0).
- If any monster reaches the player's position (0), the player loses.
- We need to determine if we can kill all monsters before any of them reach the player.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Sorting Monsters by Distance:**
   ```python
   sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
   ```
   This sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the player. This makes sense because we should prioritize shooting at the closest monsters first to prevent them from reaching the player.

2. **Processing Each Second:**
   ```python
   distance = 0
   pos = 0
   while pos != len(sorted_indices):
       if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
           return False
       rest = k
       while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
           delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
           rest -= delta
           a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
           if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
               pos += 1
       distance += 1
   return True
   ```
   - `distance` keeps track of how many seconds have passed.
   - `pos` tracks the next monster to consider.
   - The loop continues until all monsters are either dead or processed.
   - If a monster reaches the player's position (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, we shoot as many bullets as possible (`rest`) at the current monster, reducing its health. If the monster's health drops to zero, we move to the next monster.
   - After processing all possible shots for the current second, we increment `distance`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The approach prioritizes shooting at the closest monsters, which is a reasonable strategy to prevent them from reaching the player.
- The logic for shooting and moving monsters seems correct.
- The function correctly handles the case where a monster reaches the player's position.
- The function returns `True` if all monsters are killed before any reach the player, and `False` otherwise.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
