Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input and 1 <= n <= 52, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is the string 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.**
