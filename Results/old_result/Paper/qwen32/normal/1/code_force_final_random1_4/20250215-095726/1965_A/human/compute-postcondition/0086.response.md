The given code snippet only assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `test`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`; `test` is True.**
