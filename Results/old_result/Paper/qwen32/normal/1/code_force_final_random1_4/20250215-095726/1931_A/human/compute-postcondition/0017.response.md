The code snippet appends a substring from the `alphabet` string to the `word` variable, followed by 'zz'. Specifically, it accesses the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string and concatenates it with 'zz' to `word`. Given that `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the index `n - 53` must be within the range of 0 to 25 for valid character access.

Let's determine the new value of `word`:
- If `n` is 53, `alphabet[n - 53]` is `alphabet[0]`, which is 'a'.
- If `n` is 54, `alphabet[n - 53]` is `alphabet[1]`, which is 'b'.
- ...
- If `n` is 78, `alphabet[n - 53]` is `alphabet[25]`, which is 'z'.

Thus, `word` becomes `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.

Since `i` is mentioned as being incremented by 1 in the initial state, we assume `i` was incremented before this code snippet was executed. However, the code snippet itself does not affect `i` again, so its value remains as `i + 1`.

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
