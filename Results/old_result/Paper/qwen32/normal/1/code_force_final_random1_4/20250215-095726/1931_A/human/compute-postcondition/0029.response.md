Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, and `word` is constructed as follows: if `n` is greater than 26, `word` becomes `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`; otherwise, `word` becomes `'aa' + the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet`.**
