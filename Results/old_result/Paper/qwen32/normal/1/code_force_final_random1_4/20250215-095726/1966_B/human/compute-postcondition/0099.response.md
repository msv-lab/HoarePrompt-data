The code snippet assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `ans`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `tc`, `impossible`, `i`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that t >= 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all inputs provided during the loop), `tc` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is `n` - 1, `ans` is `'YES'`.**
