The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given that there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables directly. Therefore, none of the variables (`data`, `idx`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `results`) are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 4 + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `q - 1` and is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains the string `'YES'`.**
