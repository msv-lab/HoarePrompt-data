To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 2
- `k` is `i` if `res` equals `'<'`, otherwise `k` remains 1
- `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received
- `res` is the value of the input received
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the last iteration

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 2 up to but not including `n`.
- At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` has some value, say `i_end`.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` does not change as it is the upper bound of the loop.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`, and `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i` if `res` equals `'<'`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received; `res` is the value of the input received, `i` is `i_end + 1`**
