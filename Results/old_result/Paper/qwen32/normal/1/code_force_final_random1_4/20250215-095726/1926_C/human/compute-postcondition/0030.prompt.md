Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, N):
    pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
    for j in str(i):
        pd[i] += int(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `t`: Remains the same as the input integer.
   - `N`: Remains 200001.
   - `pd`: A list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 4 to `t` contains the sum of the digits of `i`. All other elements remain 0.
   - `i`: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `t + 1`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer, N is 200001, i is t, pd[t] is pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
