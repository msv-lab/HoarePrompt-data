To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0 because `range(n + 1)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `n + 1`. If `n + 1` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- The state before the loop starts is `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of `n+1` zeros).
- The variable `sm` is `-111`.

From the loop head, we can see that the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`. However, `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts. The critical variable here is `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n + 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 0.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is non-negative. The initial state of the list does not affect the execution of the loop, and `sm` is also irrelevant to the loop's execution based on the given loop head.

State: **`[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of `n+1` zeros), `sm` is -111, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
