To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `u2vs` is an adjacency list.
- `d` is a list of distances.
- `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is a list of previous vertices.
- `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` followed by the newly appended tuple `(c2, i)`.
- `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `1 <= k + 2 < len(path_ba) - c1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range Parameters:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - The loop ends when `i >= len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.

2. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k + 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 2, so the new value of `i` would be `(k + 2) + 2 = k + 4`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The new value of `i` (`k + 4`) must satisfy the condition `1 <= i < len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - Since `k + 2` was the previous value of `i` and it satisfied the condition, `k + 4` should also satisfy it, provided that the loop hasn't reached its end yet.

### Adjusted State:

The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops`, `c2`, `c1`) are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` followed by the newly appended tuple `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `k + 4` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `1 <= k + 4 < len(path_ba) - c1`**.
