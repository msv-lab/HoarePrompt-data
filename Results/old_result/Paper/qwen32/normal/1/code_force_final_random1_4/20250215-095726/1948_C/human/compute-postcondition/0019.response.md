In this case, the loop variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop runs `t` times. Since `_` is not used within the loop body, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, which means `t` should be decremented by 1 each time the loop iterates.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is simply "Yes", it doesn't provide specific values for `t`. However, based on the loop condition, we know that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

Let's assume `t` was some value `k` at the start of the previous iteration, and since the loop has just finished an iteration, `t` would now be `k-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented further to `k-2`.

Since the exact value of `t` at the start of the previous iteration isn't specified, we can generalize that `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **Yes, `t` is decremented by 1** 

However, if we need to specify a concrete state, let's assume `t` was 5 at the start of the previous iteration. After the previous iteration, `t` would be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be 3.

State: **Yes, `t` is 3** 

If no specific initial value of `t` is given, the most accurate general answer would be:

State: **`t` is decremented by 1**
