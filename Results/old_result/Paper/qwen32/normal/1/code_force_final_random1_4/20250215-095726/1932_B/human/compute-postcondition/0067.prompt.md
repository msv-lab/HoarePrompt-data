Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing one element which is the LCM of `a`, `current_year` is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the list `a`, `next_year` is undefined as it is not used outside the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `current_year` is the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `next_year` is undefined; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a`, the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`, and the third being `current_year`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`; `next_year` is equal to `current_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
