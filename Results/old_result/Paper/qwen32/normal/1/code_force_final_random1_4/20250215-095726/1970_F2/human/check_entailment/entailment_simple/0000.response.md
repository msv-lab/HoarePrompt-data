### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code and compare it with the problem requirements to determine if it is correct.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
2. **Movement Handling**: The code handles movements for the Quaffle, players, and the Bludger.
3. **Bludger Elimination**: The code checks for collisions with the Bludger and eliminates players accordingly.
4. **Goal Scoring**: The code checks if the Quaffle is placed in a goal and updates the score accordingly.
5. **Final Output**: The code prints the final score at the end.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initialization**:
  - The field is read line by line and parsed to identify players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
  - Positions are stored appropriately in dictionaries and lists.
  
- **Movement Handling**:
  - The `func_1` function correctly calculates new positions based on movement commands.
  - Movements for the Quaffle and players are handled correctly.
  
- **Bludger Elimination**:
  - When a player moves to the same position as the Bludger, the player is eliminated.
  - If the player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle remains in the cell.
  
- **Goal Scoring**:
  - The code checks if the Quaffle is placed in a goal and updates the score.
  - It correctly identifies the team that scores and prints the appropriate message.
  - If a player scores in their own goal, the other team gets the point.
  
- **Final Output**:
  - The final score is printed after all actions are processed.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Assignment vs Comparison**:
  - There is a critical issue in the `elif mo[1] == 'C':` block where `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`. This means the Quaffle is not being assigned to the player who catches it, which would lead to incorrect behavior.

Given the above analysis, the program is mostly correct but has a critical bug in the catching mechanism.

### Conclusion:
Due to the identified bug in the catching mechanism, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**
