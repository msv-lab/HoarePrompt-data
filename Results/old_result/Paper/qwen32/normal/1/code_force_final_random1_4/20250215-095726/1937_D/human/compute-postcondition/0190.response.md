Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; if `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `((B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**
