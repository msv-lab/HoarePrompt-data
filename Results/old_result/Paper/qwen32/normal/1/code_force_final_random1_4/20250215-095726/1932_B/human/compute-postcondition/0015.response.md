The code snippet updates the variable `a` by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. The variables `t` and `year` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` remains the input integer, and `a` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `year` is the final value after all iterations of the loop have completed**.
