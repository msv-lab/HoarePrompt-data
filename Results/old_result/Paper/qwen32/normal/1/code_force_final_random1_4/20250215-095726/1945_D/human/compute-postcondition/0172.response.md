Output State: **`custo` is `custo + a_values[y]`; `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition; `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`; `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`; `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`; `nf` is a list of substrings from the input; `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input; `b` is a list of substrings from the new input; `y` is `y - 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `custo` is updated by adding `a_values[y]` to it. The list `custos` records this new value of `custo`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, and `y` which is now decremented by 1.
