### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to see if it correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts during promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `2*a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them during the promotion. Therefore, the cost is simply `n * a`.
   - **Condition 2:** If `n` is even and `2*a >= b`, it means buying yogurts in pairs during the promotion is cheaper or equally cheap. Therefore, the cost is `(n/2) * b`.
   - **Condition 3:** If `n` is odd and `2*a >= b`, it means buying yogurts in pairs during the promotion is cheaper or equally cheap, except for the last yogurt which must be bought individually. Therefore, the cost is `((n-1)/2) * b + a`.

However, the code does not match this logic perfectly. Let's break down the code:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)
```

- **Condition 1:** If `B * 2 < C`, it correctly prints `A * B` (which corresponds to `n * a` in our explanation).
- **Condition 2:** If `A % 2 == 0`, it correctly prints `int(A * C / 2)` (which corresponds to `(n/2) * b` in our explanation).
- **Condition 3:** If `A % 2 != 0`, it calculates `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`. Here, `X * C` corresponds to `((n-1)/2) * b`, and adding `B` (price of one yogurt) is correct.

Thus, the code correctly handles all scenarios and computes the minimum cost accurately.
