### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that:
   - Each element `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
   - For every `i` from `2` to `n`, `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. The program initializes `a[0]` to `1000`, which is within the allowed range (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`).
2. For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from `1` to `n-1`), it sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]` and thus `a[i] % a[i-1]` will be equal to `x[i-1]` as required by the problem.

#### Verification:
- Given `a[0] = 1000` and `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, we can see that `a[i]` will always be greater than `a[i-1]`.
- Therefore, `a[i] % a[i-1]` will indeed be `x[i-1]` for all `i` from `2` to `n`, satisfying the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

Since the program generates an array `a` that meets all the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
