To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)`, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- **`a`**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input, with constraints `1 <= len(a) <= 18` and `0 <= a[i] <= 10^7` for each element `a[i]` in `a`.
- **`n`**: This is an input integer, but its exact value isn't specified in the initial state.
- **`s`, `m`, and `ops`**: These are values returned by the function `func_2(a)`. The variable `ops` is explicitly mentioned to be a non-empty list of tuples, but the specific contents of `s`, `m`, and `ops` are not provided.

### Key Variables in the Print Statement:

- **`l`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state. It could be an index or a value derived from the list `a` or another part of the program's logic.
- **`r`**: Similar to `l`, this variable is also not explicitly defined in the initial state. It could be another index or a value derived from the list `a` or another part of the program's logic.

### Analysis:

Given that `l` and `r` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. However, based on common programming practices, especially in problems involving lists and indices, `l` and `r` are often used to represent left and right boundaries or indices within a list.

### Conclusion:

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The print statement will output the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are indices or values derived from the list a or another part of the program's logic)**
