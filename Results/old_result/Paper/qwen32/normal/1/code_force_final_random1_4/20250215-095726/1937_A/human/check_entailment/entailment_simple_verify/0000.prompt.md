You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:

    #State: After processing all `t` test cases, the program will have printed a series of integers corresponding to the results of each test case. Each printed integer is either 1 (if `n` was 1) or the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` (if `n` was greater than 1).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We start with an array `a` where `a[i] = i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
- For each `i` from `2` to `n`, we perform a `swap(k)` operation where `k = i`.
- The `swap(k)` operation swaps `a[d]` and `a[k]` where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` other than `k` itself.
- We need to find the final position of `1` in the array after performing all the swaps.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using logarithms and powers of 2. Here is the program again for reference:
```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
```

#### Key Points:
- The program handles the case `n = 1` correctly by printing `1`.
- For `n > 1`, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and prints `2 ** power`.

#### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the behavior of the swaps and how they affect the position of `1`.

1. **Initial Array**: `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`
2. **Swap Operations**:
   - For `k = 2`, `d = 1`, so `a[1]` and `a[2]` are swapped → `[2, 1, 3, ..., n]`
   - For `k = 3`, `d = 1`, so `a[1]` and `a[3]` are swapped → `[3, 1, 2, ..., n]`
   - For `k = 4`, `d = 2`, so `a[2]` and `a[4]` are swapped → `[3, 4, 2, 1, ..., n]`
   - And so on...

The key observation is that the position of `1` will be influenced by the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. This is because the swaps involving higher powers of 2 will eventually place `1` in a position corresponding to the largest power of 2.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional cases:

1. **Input**: `1`
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Program Output**: `1` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `4`
   - **Expected Output**: `4`
   - **Program Output**: `4` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `5`
   - **Expected Output**: `4`
   - **Program Output**: `4` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `120240229`
   - **Expected Output**: `67108864`
   - **Program Output**: `67108864` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to correctly determine the final position of `1` in the array after performing the specified swaps for various values of `n`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and uses it to determine the final position of `1` in the array after performing the swaps as described in the problem statement. The provided test cases and additional testing confirm the correctness of the program for various inputs.
