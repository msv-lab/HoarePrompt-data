To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state:

```
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly used in this code snippet).
- `i` is 2 (not directly used in this code snippet).
- `l` must be greater than 4 (not directly used in this code snippet).
- `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `alp` is a predefined list of characters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`.
- `ans` is a list containing one character from `alp`.
- `j` is 4.

Let's break down the code:
- `rev_array[j:]` slices the `rev_array` starting from index `j` (which is 4) to the end.
- `rev_array[j]` gets the element at index `j` in `rev_array`.
- `.count(rev_array[j])` counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sliced list `rev_array[j:]`.
- `alp[...]` accesses the character in `alp` at the index specified by the count minus one.

Since the exact values of `array` and `rev_array` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact character appended to `ans`. However, we can express the output state in terms of these variables.

Let's denote:
- `count_val` as the number of times `rev_array[4]` appears in `rev_array[4:]`.

Then, the character appended to `ans` will be `alp[count_val - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 4, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`, `ans` is a list containing two characters where the second character is `alp[rev_array[4:].count(rev_array[4]) - 1]`, `j` is 4.**
