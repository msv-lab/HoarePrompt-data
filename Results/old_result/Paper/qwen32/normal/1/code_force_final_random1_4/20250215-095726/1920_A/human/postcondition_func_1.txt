The function reads a line of input from the user and processes it based on the values of the `space` and `to_int` parameters. If `space` is `True`, the input line is split into substrings separated by whitespace; otherwise, it is split into individual characters. If `to_int` is `True`, each substring or character is converted to an integer. The function returns a list of these processed items.
