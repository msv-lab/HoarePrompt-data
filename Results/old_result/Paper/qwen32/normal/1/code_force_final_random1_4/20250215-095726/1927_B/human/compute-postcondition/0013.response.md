To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current snippet since we're focusing on a single execution context.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `l` is the length of the input array.
- `array` is the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet letters, i.e., `['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']`.
- `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`.
- `ans` is a list of `l` characters where each character is determined by the count of the element in the remaining part of the reversed array. Specifically, for each index `j` in the range `l`, `ans[j]` is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reversing the Array**: `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`. For example, if `array` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `rev_array` will be `[3, 2, 1]`.

2. **Constructing `ans`**:
   - For each index `j` in `rev_array`, `ans[j]` is determined by counting how many times `rev_array[j]` appears in the slice `rev_array[j:]` and then subtracting 1 from this count.
   - This count is then used as an index to select a character from the `alp` list.
   - For example, if `rev_array` is `[3, 2, 1]` and `rev_array[j]` is `3` at `j=0`, the count of `3` in `rev_array[0:]` is 1, so `ans[0]` will be `alp[1-1]` which is `'a'`.
   - If `rev_array[j]` is `2` at `j=1`, the count of `2` in `rev_array[1:]` is 1, so `ans[1]` will be `alp[1-1]` which is `'a'`.
   - If `rev_array[j]` is `1` at `j=2`, the count of `1` in `rev_array[2:]` is 1, so `ans[2]` will be `alp[1-1]` which is `'a'`.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - The `map(str, ans)` converts each character in `ans` to a string (though they are already characters).
   - `''.join(...)` concatenates these characters into a single string.
   - The final result is printed.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example where `array = [1, 2, 2, 3]`:
- `rev_array` becomes `[3, 2, 2, 1]`.
- For `j=0`, `rev_array[0]` is `3`, and `rev_array[0:].count(3)` is 1, so `ans[0]` is `alp[1-1]` which is `'a'`.
- For `j=1`, `rev_array[1]` is `2`, and `rev_array[1:].count(2)` is 2, so `ans[1]` is `alp[2-1]` which is `'b'`.
- For `j=2`, `rev_array[2]` is `2`, and `rev_array[2:].count(2)` is 1, so `ans[2]` is `alp[1-1]` which is `'a'`.
- For `j=3`, `rev_array[3]` is `1`, and `rev_array[3:].count(1)` is 1, so `ans[3]` is `alp[1-1]` which is `'a'`.
- Thus, `ans` becomes `['a', 'b', 'a', 'a']`.

### Final Output:
Given the above explanation, the output of the `print` statement will be the concatenated string of characters in `ans`.

Output: **'abaa' (where each character in 'abaa' corresponds to the count-based mapping from the reversed array)**
