The code calculates `total_matchs` by performing integer division of `total_points` by 2. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, and `resultats` remain unchanged except for the new variable `total_matchs`.

Given that `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test` and is already defined, `total_matchs` will be half of `total_points` (integer division).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, otherwise `resultats` is an empty list, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.**
