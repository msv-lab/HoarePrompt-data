The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. The loop iterates from `0` to `k-1`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between `0` and `k-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it should still be less than `k`.

Let's determine the new state of `i`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `x` where `0 <= x < k`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` assuming `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `tmp` is 'b' if `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`**
