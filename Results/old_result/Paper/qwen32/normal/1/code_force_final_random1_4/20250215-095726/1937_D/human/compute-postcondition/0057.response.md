To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and understand how the variables `B` and `idx_B` evolve.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s`: A string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n`: The length of the string `s`.
- `A`: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s` (not modified by the loop).
- `idx_A`: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s` (not modified by the loop).
- `B`: An initially empty list.
- `idx_B`: An initially empty list.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`. For each iteration:
- `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`.
- If `s[i]` is '<':
  - If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is initialized with `[0]`.
  - If `idx_B` is not empty, a new value `x` is calculated as `B[-1] + (idx_B[-1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and then appended to `B`.
  - `i` is appended to `idx_B`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations (`j` goes from `0` to `n-1`), the loop will have processed every character in the string `s` from right to left. Here's the final state:

- `s`: Remains unchanged.
- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `A`: Remains unchanged.
- `idx_A`: Remains unchanged.
- `B`: Contains a series of computed values based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B`: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.

### Calculation of `B` and `idx_B`:
- `idx_B` will contain all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<'.
- `B` will contain values computed based on the positions of '<' characters and the current state of `B` and `idx_B`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example string `s = "><><"`. Here, `n = 4`.

1. **Iteration 1 (j=0, i=3)**: `s[3]` is `<`, `idx_B` is empty, so `B` becomes `[0]`, and `idx_B` becomes `[3]`.
2. **Iteration 2 (j=1, i=2)**: `s[2]` is `>`, no changes to `B` or `idx_B`.
3. **Iteration 3 (j=2, i=1)**: `s[1]` is `<`, `idx_B` is `[3]`, so `x = 0 + (3 - 1) * 1 = 2`, `B` becomes `[0, 2]`, and `idx_B` becomes `[3, 1]`.
4. **Iteration 4 (j=3, i=0)**: `s[0]` is `>`, no changes to `B` or `idx_B`.

### Final Output State:
- `B` will be `[0, 2]`.
- `idx_B` will be `[3, 1]`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.**
