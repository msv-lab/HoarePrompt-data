The given code snippet only modifies the variable `curr` by incrementing it by 1. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`) are altered by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. `cnt_b[a[2m + 1]]` is decremented by 1. `curr` is increased by 1.**
