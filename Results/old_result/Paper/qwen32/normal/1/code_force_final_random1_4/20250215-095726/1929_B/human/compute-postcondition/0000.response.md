The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the value of `t` is updated based on the user's input, while the conditions on `t` (that it is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive) remain valid.

Since no other variables are mentioned or modified in the code snippet, their initial states remain unchanged. Specifically, `n` and `k` retain their initial descriptions as integers within specified ranges.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 4`n` - 2.**
