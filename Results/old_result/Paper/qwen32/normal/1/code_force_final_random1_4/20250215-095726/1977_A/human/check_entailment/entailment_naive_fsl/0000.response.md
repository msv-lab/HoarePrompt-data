Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move consists of either adding or removing exactly 1 cube.
- Output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:

1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Finding Edge Cases:
Let's consider some edge cases and see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `n == m`.

2. **Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - The program correctly outputs "No" because `m > n`.

3. **Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 2`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

4. **Case 4:** `n = 4`, `m = 2`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 2`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

5. **Case 5:** `n = 5`, `m = 1`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 4`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

6. **Case 6:** `n = 6`, `m = 0`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 6`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

7. **Case 7:** `n = 5`, `m = 4`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 1`, which is directly handled by the condition `elif m == n - 1:`.

8. **Case 8:** `n = 4`, `m = 1`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 3`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

9. **Case 9:** `n = 3`, `m = 0`
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 3`, which is allowed by adding and removing cubes.

10. **Case 10:** `n = 2`, `m = 1`
    - The program correctly outputs "Yes" because `m == n - 1`, which is directly handled by the condition `elif m == n - 1:`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided test cases and edge cases, it appears that the program correctly determines whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic covers all necessary scenarios, including when `m` is less than, equal to, or greater than `n`, and it correctly handles both even and odd values of `m` and `n`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
