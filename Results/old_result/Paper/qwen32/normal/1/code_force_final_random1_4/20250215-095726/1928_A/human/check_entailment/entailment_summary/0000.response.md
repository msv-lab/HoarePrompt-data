Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements:

### Problem Analysis
Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. The key observations are:
- If both dimensions `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
- If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, Bob can also form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows this logic:
- It checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints 'yes'.
- It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd (`(a - b) % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'yes'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Issues in the Program
The second condition in the program is incorrectly implemented. The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` does not correctly check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd. Instead, it seems to be checking something unrelated.

However, the third condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` effectively checks if the absolute difference is non-zero, which is not what we need. We need to check if the absolute difference is odd, which should be done using `(a - b) % 2 != 0`.

### Correct Implementation
The correct implementation should look like this:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif abs(a - b) % 2 != 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion
Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly handle all cases due to the incorrect condition for checking if the absolute difference is odd. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
