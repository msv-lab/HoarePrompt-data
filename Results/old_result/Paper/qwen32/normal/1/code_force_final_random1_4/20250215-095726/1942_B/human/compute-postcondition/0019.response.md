To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This seems to indicate the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the current code snippet.
- `n`: An input integer representing the length of the list `ar`.
- `ar`: A list of integers with `n` elements.
- `res`: A list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- `mex`: The minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet joins the elements of the list `res` into a single string, with each element separated by a space, and then prints this string.

### Calculation of `res`:
The list `res` is constructed in a specific way:
- It starts from the last element of `ar` and moves to the first element.
- For each element `ar[i]` in `ar`, it calculates `mex - ar[i]` and stores it in `res[i]`.

The value of `mex` is defined as the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop. However, the definition of `mex` here seems unusual because typically `mex` (minimum excluded value) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in a set. Given the context, it seems `mex` is dynamically adjusted to ensure the minimum difference `mex - ar[i]` is non-negative and minimized.

### Output Description:
Given the above steps, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res[0] res[1] ... res[n-1] (where res[i] = mex - ar[i] for i from len(ar) - 1 down to 0, and mex is the minimum value of mex - ar[i] encountered during the loop)**

This output represents the transformed list `res` after the specified calculations. Each element in `res` is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `ar` from `mex`, ensuring the minimum difference is achieved.
