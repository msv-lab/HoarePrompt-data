Output State: **`t` is t-1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list [0] + list(map(int, input().split())), `b` is a new list [0] + list(map(int, input().split())), `ad` is [0] + [a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a))], `bd` is [0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))], `v` is [0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))], `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is the newly read integer input, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values as described in the Initial State.
