### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters before they reach the origin (position 0).
- **Logic**:
  - It first sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute positions (`abs(x[i])`). This ensures that we consider the closest monsters first.
  - It then iterates through these sorted indices, keeping track of the number of steps taken (`distance`).
  - For each step, it checks if any monster is at a position where its distance from the origin equals the number of steps taken (`if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`). If so, it returns `False` because that monster would have reached the origin.
  - Otherwise, it fires bullets at the monsters, reducing their health by the minimum of the remaining bullets (`rest`) and the monster's current health (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]`).
  - If a monster's health drops to zero, it moves to the next monster.
  - If all monsters are defeated before any of them reach the origin, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each test case to determine if it is possible to defeat all monsters.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases (`t`).
  - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (`n`), the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second (`k`), the list of health values (`a`), and the list of initial positions (`x`).
  - It calls `func_1` with these values and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Verification:
- **Sorting by Absolute Position**: Sorting the monsters by their absolute positions ensures that we handle the closest monsters first, which is crucial for preventing them from reaching the origin.
- **Step-by-Step Simulation**: The function simulates each second, checking if any monster has reached the origin and firing bullets at the monsters to reduce their health.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input for each case and applying the logic defined in `func_1`.

Based on the above analysis, both functions appear to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
