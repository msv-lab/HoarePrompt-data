To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24
- `i` is 1
- `x` is a string from user input
- `j` is 2

Code Snippet:
```python
a[i] += 1
```

This line of code increments the value at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. 

Since `i` is 1, the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the contents of the list `a`. We assume `a` is a list that has at least two elements (since `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2).

Therefore, the value at `a[1]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, `j` is 2, `a[1]` is incremented by 1.**
