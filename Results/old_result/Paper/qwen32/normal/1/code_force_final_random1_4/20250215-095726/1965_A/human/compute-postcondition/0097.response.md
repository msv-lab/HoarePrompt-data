To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head here is `for j in range(1, len(lis))`. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust is `j`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.

Since the loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 up to `len(lis) - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Note: The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `j` is incremented by 1.
