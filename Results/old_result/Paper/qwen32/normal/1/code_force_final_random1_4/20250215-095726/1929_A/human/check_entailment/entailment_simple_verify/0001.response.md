### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

#### Key Insight:
To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.

#### Provided Solution:
The solution sorts the array and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_{\text{max}} - a_{\text{min}} \]

#### Correctness of the Provided Solution:
The original assessment suggests that the solution is incorrect because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, rather than the sum of all consecutive differences. However, let's verify this claim.

When the array is sorted, the beauty can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

Notice that this telescopes to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

This means that the sum of all consecutive differences in a sorted array is indeed the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify with the first example:
- Input: `3 2 1 3`
- Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- Difference between max and min: `3 - 1 = 2`

The provided solution outputs `3-1=2`, which is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct because the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in a sorted array is equivalent to the sum of all consecutive differences.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
