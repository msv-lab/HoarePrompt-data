The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, the first element of `data` is the integer `t`, and the remaining elements are the integers `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` and the queries, all as strings. `idx` is now 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data`.
