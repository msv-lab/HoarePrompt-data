Given the code snippet `l = func_3(c, l)`, we know that the value of `l` is being updated by the result of the function `func_3` with arguments `c` and `l`. Since the initial state specifies that `c` is 2, and `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` from a previous call, the new value of `l` will be the result of `func_3(2, l)`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and the conditions involving `k` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code. Since there is no modification to `n`, `k`, or `i` in the given snippet, these variables retain their initial values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the initial `k` (unchanged), `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is 1, and if `k` equals 0, the program returns the value of `l`. If `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`**.
