The `break` statement does not affect any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given context, the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `int(n / 4)`**
