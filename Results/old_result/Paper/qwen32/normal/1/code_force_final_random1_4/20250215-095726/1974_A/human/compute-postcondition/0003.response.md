The value of `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The condition that `a` must be greater than 0 is still valid but `a` is not involved in the calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `a` must be greater than 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.**
