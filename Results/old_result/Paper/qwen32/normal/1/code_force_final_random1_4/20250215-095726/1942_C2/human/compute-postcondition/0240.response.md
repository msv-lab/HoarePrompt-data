Output State: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st` during the loop iterations, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` and `even` is an empty list if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise `odd` is an empty list and `even` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise `even` remains an empty list, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `gap` is recalculated using the formula `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
