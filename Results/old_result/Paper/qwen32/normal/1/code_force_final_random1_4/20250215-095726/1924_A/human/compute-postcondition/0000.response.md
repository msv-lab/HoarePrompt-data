`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
