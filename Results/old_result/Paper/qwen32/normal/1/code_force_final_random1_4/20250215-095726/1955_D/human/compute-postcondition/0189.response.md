The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value stored in the dictionary `cnt_b` at the key `a[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1, but the values of `a[i]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are not specified. After executing the code, the value of `cnt_b[a[1]]` will be decreased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1.**
