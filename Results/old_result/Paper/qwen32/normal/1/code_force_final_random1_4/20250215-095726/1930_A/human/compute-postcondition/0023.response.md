To determine the output of the `print(score)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. This represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly influence the calculation of `score` in this context.
- `n` is the length of the new input list. This tells us how many integers are in the list.
- `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input. This means that the list `l` is sorted in ascending order.
- `score` is the sum of elements at even indices in `l`. In Python, list indexing starts at 0, so the even indices are 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index that is less than `n`.

Given these definitions, the `score` is calculated by summing the elements located at even indices in the sorted list `l`.

Let's illustrate this with an example:
Suppose the input list is `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]`. After sorting, `l` becomes `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]`. The elements at even indices are `l[0] = 1`, `l[2] = 2`, `l[4] = 4`, and `l[6] = 9`. Therefore, `score` would be `1 + 2 + 4 + 9 = 16`.

However, since the specific values of `n` and the contents of `l` are not provided, we can only describe the `score` in terms of the sorted list `l`.

Thus, the output of the `print(score)` statement will be the sum of the elements at even indices in the sorted list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements at even indices in the sorted list `l`)**
