To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Given Code:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

Variables and their initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`
- `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty
- `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`
- `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`
- `j` is `j + 1`

The code calculates a new value for `x` based on the last element of `B`, the last element of `idx_B`, the current value of `i`, and the length of `idx_B`.

Let's denote:
- `B_last` as `B[len(B) - 1]`
- `idx_B_last` as `idx_B[len(B) - 1]`
- `len_idx_B` as `len(idx_B)`

The formula for `x` becomes:
```python
x = B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B
```

After this calculation, `x` is updated with the new value.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty; `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`; `j` is `j + 1`; `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B`.**

This means that `x` has been recalculated and updated based on the provided formula, while all other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
