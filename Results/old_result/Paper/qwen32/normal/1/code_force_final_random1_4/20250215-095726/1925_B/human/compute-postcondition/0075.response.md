Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, and `i` is 5. If `x % 5 == 0` and `x - n * 5 >= 0` and `(x - n * 5) % 5 == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 4`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.**
