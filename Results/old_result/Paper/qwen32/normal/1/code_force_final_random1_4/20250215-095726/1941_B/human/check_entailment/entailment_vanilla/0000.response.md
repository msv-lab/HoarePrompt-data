Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine whether we can reduce all elements of an array to zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to select an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and perform the following changes:
- Decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
- Decrease \( a_i \) by 2.
- Decrease \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

We need to check if it's possible to apply this operation any number of times to make all elements zero.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Check**: Since each operation decreases the total sum of the array by 4, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reduce it to zero.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The first and last elements play a special role because they do not have both neighbors to interact with. Specifically, the first element can only be reduced by the operation affecting the second element, and similarly, the last element can only be reduced by the operation affecting the second-to-last element.
3. **Specific Constraints**: If the first element is odd, the second element must be exactly 2 more than the first element to allow the first element to be reduced to zero through the operation. Similarly, if the last element is odd, the second-to-last element must be exactly 2 more than the last element.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the following conditions:
- If the first element is odd and the second element is not exactly 2 more than the first element, it prints "NO".
- If the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not exactly 2 more than the last element, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, this logic is incomplete and incorrect because:
- It does not check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4.
- It does not consider the possibility of reducing the middle elements to zero while ensuring the boundary conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to account for the total sum condition and does not fully ensure that the array can be reduced to zero under the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
