The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `start` to 0. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would affect the existing state of `arr` or `nums`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0.**
