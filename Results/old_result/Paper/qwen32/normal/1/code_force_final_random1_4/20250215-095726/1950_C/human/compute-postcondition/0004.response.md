Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
  - `s` is the input string.
  - `h` is the first two characters of `s`, and `h` equals '00'.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print('12', end='')
  ```

The `print` function in Python outputs the specified message to the console. In this case, the message is the string `'12'`. The `end=''` parameter specifies that after printing the message, no newline character should be added at the end.

Given the initial state, there are no variables or objects from the state that influence the output of this specific `print` statement. The string `'12'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **12**
