To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

### Key Observations:
1. **Divisibility Check**: For a number `i` to be a potential candidate for the GCD, `x` must be divisible by `i` (`x % i == 0`). This is because all difficulties must be multiples of `i`.
2. **Sum Constraint**: If `i` is a candidate, the total difficulty `x` should be able to be partitioned into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `i`. This means `(x - n * i)` must be non-negative and divisible by `i`.
3. **Iterate Over Possible Divisors**: We iterate over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to check these conditions efficiently.
4. **Check Both `i` and `x/i`**: For each divisor `i`, we also check `x/i` as a potential candidate because both `i` and `x/i` could be valid divisors.

### Program Logic:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
- It initializes `ans` to 1 (since the minimum GCD is 1).
- It iterates over all possible divisors `i` from 1 to `sqrt(x)`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` and if the remaining difficulty after subtracting `n * i` is divisible by `i`.
- It also checks the same conditions for `x/i`.
- It updates `ans` with the maximum valid divisor found.
- Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies all possible divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`.
- It checks both `i` and `x/i` as potential candidates for the GCD.
- It ensures that the remaining difficulty after partitioning is divisible by the candidate GCD.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
