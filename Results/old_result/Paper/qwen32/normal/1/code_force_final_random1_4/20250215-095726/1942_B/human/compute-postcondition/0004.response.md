The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `ar`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers read from the input; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`; `mex` is `n`.**
