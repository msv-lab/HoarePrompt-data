To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. This represents the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation of `score` for a single test case.
   - `n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the list `l`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.
   - `score` is the sum of elements at even indices of `l`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(score)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - Since `score` is defined as the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `l`, we need to calculate this sum.
   - The even indices in a list of length `n` are `0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n//2 - 1)` if `n` is even, or `0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n//2)` if `n` is odd.
   - The specific values of these elements depend on the input list `l`.

Given that we do not have the exact values of `l` or `n`, we can only describe the `score` in terms of the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `l`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `l`)**
