To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `l`.

From the given information:
- The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `l`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1 and `l` is at least 3.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is the length of the binary string representation of `n` and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`k` equals 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is the binary string representation of `n`, `l` is the length of `b` (which must be at least 3), `ans` is `[2, 3, 2]`, `i` is 2**
