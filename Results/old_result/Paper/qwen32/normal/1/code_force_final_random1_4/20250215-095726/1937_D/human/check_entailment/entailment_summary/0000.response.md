### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The algorithm uses two main lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of cumulative movements for '>' and '<' directions respectively. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization and Parsing**:
   - For each test case, the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` are read.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called to process the string.

2. **Processing '>' Directions**:
   - The code iterates through the string `s` and constructs list `A` to store cumulative movements for cells with '>' characters.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of indices of '>' characters.

3. **Processing '<' Directions**:
   - Similarly, the code iterates through the string `s` in reverse and constructs list `B` to store cumulative movements for cells with '<' characters.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of indices of '<' characters.

4. **Calculating Output**:
   - For each cell in the grid, the code determines whether the pinball starts moving in the '>' or '<' direction.
   - Depending on the direction, it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The results are printed for each starting position.

### Analysis:

- **Cumulative Movements**: The cumulative movements (`A` and `B`) are calculated correctly based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters. This helps in determining the total distance traveled by the pinball.
- **Direction Handling**: The code handles both '>' and '<' directions separately, ensuring that the movements are accurately tracked and combined.
- **Edge Cases**: The code considers edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or after several movements.
- **Complexity**: The algorithm efficiently processes the grid in linear time relative to the number of cells, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the cumulative movements and direction changes accurately, and it produces the expected output for the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
