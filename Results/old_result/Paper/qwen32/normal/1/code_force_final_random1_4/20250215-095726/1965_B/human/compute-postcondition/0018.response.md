The code snippet calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. 

Given the initial state, `lk` is now assigned the value of `len(bk)`, which is the length of the binary string representation of `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 < k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `lk` is the length of `bk`.**
