Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 2`, `pos = 1`, `rest = 10`, `delta = 0`**

Explanation: The value of `delta` is 0, so subtracting `delta` from `rest` does not change the value of `rest`. All other variables remain unchanged.
