To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `i * i <= n + i`.

Given the current state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers returned by `func_7()`, with `n` being at least 2.
- `i` is 3.
- `ans` is `(n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4)`.

We need to ensure that the condition `i * i <= n + i` holds true for the loop to execute again.

Let's substitute `i = 3` into the inequality:
\[ 3 * 3 \leq n + 3 \]
\[ 9 \leq n + 3 \]
\[ 6 \leq n \]

So, `n` must be at least 6 for the loop to execute one more time. The values of `m` and `ans` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be at least 6, `i` is 3, `m` and `ans` remain unchanged**.
