The given Python code snippet modifies the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `stop`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `a[i]` is 0
- `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`
- `stop` is not explicitly set or remains False

After executing the line `a[i + 2] -= opNum`, the value of `a[i + 2]` is reduced by `opNum`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `stop` is not explicitly set or remains False**.
