The code reads an input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, creates a list from these integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and assigns it to the variable `l`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.**
