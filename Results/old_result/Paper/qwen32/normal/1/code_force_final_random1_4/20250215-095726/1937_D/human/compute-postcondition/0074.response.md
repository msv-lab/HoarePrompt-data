Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` and is initially set to 0.
- At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'.
- `l` is not less than `r`.

### Key Points:
- We know `s[i]` is '>', so `i` is an index where there is a '>' character.
- `n` is the total length of the string `s`.
- The print statement is `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is the index of a '>' character in the string `s`, `n - i` represents the number of characters remaining in the string `s` starting from index `i` to the end of the string.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function means that after printing the value, it will not move to a new line but will add a space instead.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the print statement will output the number of characters remaining in the string `s` starting from the current index `i` to the end of the string, followed by a space.

Output: **n - i (where n is the length of the string s and i is the current index where s[i] is '>')**
