### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Points System**: 
   - Winner gets 2 points.
   - Loser gets 0 points.
   - Draw results in both players getting 1 point each.
   
2. **Constraints**:
   - Scores are non-decreasing: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - Total points must be even because points are awarded in pairs.
   - The maximum number of matches is not explicitly limited to 3 but depends on the number of games played.

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If not, it returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches as `total_points // 2`.

3. **Constraints Check**:
   - The program incorrectly limits the total number of matches to 3 with the condition `if total_matchs > 3`.
   - This constraint is too restrictive because the maximum number of matches is not limited to 3; it can be higher depending on the number of games played among the three players.
   - The condition `if p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because it assumes that the highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches, which is not necessarily true.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is used to calculate the number of draws.
   - This formula is derived under the assumption that the remaining points after accounting for the wins must be evenly distributed as draws.
   - However, the formula is not robust and can produce incorrect results for certain valid inputs, as highlighted in the counterexample.

#### Counterexample:
- **Input**: `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 2`, `p3 = 4`
- **Expected Output**: `2` (This can be achieved with 2 wins for player 3 and 2 draws among players 1 and 2)
- **Actual Output**: The program will likely output `-1` due to the incorrect constraints and formula.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program fails to handle cases where the total number of matches exceeds 3.
- The formula for calculating draws is not correct and can produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
