The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1` and `n` is `tc`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently `n-1`, incrementing `i` by 1 would make `i` equal to `n`, which would cause the loop to terminate. Therefore, to execute one more iteration, `i` should be set to `1` (the starting point of the loop), and `n` should be adjusted to be at least `3` (since `i` starts from `1` and needs to go up to `n-1`).

However, given the context and the fact that `i` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it seems like the loop has already completed its iterations as per the current state. To ensure the loop executes one more time from the beginning, we need to reset `i` to `1` and ensure `n` is at least `3`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 3; `n` is `tc`; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is 1; `dp` is `True`**
