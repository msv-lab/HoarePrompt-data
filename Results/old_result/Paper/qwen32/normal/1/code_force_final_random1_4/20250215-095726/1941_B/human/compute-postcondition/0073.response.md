The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is `a[i]` and `a[i]` is 0, the operation `a[i + 2] -= opNum` effectively does nothing because subtracting 0 from any number leaves the number unchanged.

Therefore, the value of `a[i + 2]` remains the same, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `opNum` is `a[i]`; `a[i]` is 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `stop` remains unchanged unless it was already True due to a previous condition.**
