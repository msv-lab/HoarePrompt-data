Let's analyze the problem and the given solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
- Add one cube to the tower.
- Remove one cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Odd/Even) Matters**: Since each operation changes the number of cubes by 1, the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes will alternate between odd and even with each move.
   - If you start with 0 cubes (even), after an odd number of moves, you'll have an odd number of cubes, and vice versa.
2. **Minimum Moves Requirement**: To end up with `m` cubes, you need at least `m` moves (all additions). Any fewer than `m` moves will not allow you to reach `m` cubes.
3. **Maximum Moves Constraint**: If `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

### Conditions to Check:
1. **If `n >= m`**: 
   - If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd or both even), then it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it's impossible.
2. **If `n < m`**: It's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.

### Program Analysis:
Let's review the provided code against these conditions:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition `elif m == n - 1:`**: This condition is unnecessary and incorrect. If `m == n - 1`, it should still depend on the parity of `n` and `m`. For example, if `n=3` and `m=2`, it's possible (add two cubes, remove one), but the code incorrectly says "Yes" without checking parity.
2. **Redundant Parity Checks**: The conditions `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` can be combined into a single check for parity.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `n < m`, print "No".
- Otherwise, check if `n` and `m` have the same parity. If they do, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect condition `elif m == n - 1:` and the lack of proper handling of the parity check.

**Correctness: False**
