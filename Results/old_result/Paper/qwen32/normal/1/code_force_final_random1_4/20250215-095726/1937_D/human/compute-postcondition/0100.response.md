The given code modifies the value of `b`. The new value of `b` is calculated by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its previous value.

Given the initial state, the updated value of `b` would be:

If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` was initially `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. After executing the line `b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, the new value of `b` becomes:
\[ b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l \]

If `r - l` is less than 0, `b` was initially `B[r]`. After executing the line `b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, the new value of `b` becomes:
\[ b = B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l \]

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is greater than 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1; at the current index `i`, `s[i]` is not '>'; `l` is less than or equal to `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` is updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**
