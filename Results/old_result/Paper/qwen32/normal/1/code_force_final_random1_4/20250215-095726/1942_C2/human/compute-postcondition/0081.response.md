Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified, `tmp` is a list of values `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` that met the second condition. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `tmp` also includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
