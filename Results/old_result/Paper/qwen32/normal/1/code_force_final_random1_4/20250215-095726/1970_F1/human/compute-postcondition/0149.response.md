Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input; `time` is incremented by 1; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10.**
