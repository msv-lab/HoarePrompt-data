Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program starts by reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. The loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`, and within the loop, it calculates some values and updates `ans`.

However, the logic inside the loop does not seem to correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition holds. Here is a more straightforward approach:

1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
2. For each \(a\), iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
