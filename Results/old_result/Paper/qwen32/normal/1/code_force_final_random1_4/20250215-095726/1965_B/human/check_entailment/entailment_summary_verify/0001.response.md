### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the logic behind `func_14()` to ensure it meets the problem requirements. We'll focus on both the special case when `k = 1` and the general case when `k > 1`.

#### Special Case: `k = 1`

When `k = 1`, the sequence must allow forming all sums from `2` to `n` but not `1`. The provided logic handles this as follows:
- If `n = 2`, the sequence is `[2]`, which correctly forms `2` but not `1`.
- For other values of `n`, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums from `2` to `n` can be formed but not `1`.

This part of the logic seems correct.

#### General Case: `k > 1`

For `k > 1`, the sequence must allow forming all sums from `1` to `n` except `k`. The provided logic handles this as follows:
1. **Powers of 2 up to `len(bin(k)) - 1`**: These ensure that all sums up to `k-1` can be formed using combinations of these powers.
2. **Avoiding `k`**: The sequence includes `k-1-sum(ans)` to avoid forming `k`. This term is calculated as the difference between `k-1` and the sum of the previously added powers of `2`.
3. **Additional Terms**: The sequence includes `k+1` and `2*k+1` to ensure that sums beyond `k` can be formed.
4. **Remaining Powers of 2**: The sequence continues with powers of `2` from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

However, there are some concerns with this approach:
- **Avoiding `k`**: The term `k-1-sum(ans)` might not always be a valid non-negative integer. For example, if the sum of the powers of `2` already exceeds `k-1`, this term would be negative, which is invalid.
- **Ensuring All Sums**: The inclusion of `k+1` and `2*k+1` might not guarantee that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed. Specifically, the choice of these terms and the remaining powers of `2` needs careful verification.

Let's consider a specific counterexample to illustrate the issue:
- Suppose `n = 10` and `k = 7`.
  - Binary representation of `n`: `1010` (length 4).
  - Binary representation of `k`: `111` (length 3).
  - Sequence starts with `[1, 2]` (powers of `2` up to `2^1`).
  - Next term: `k-1-sum(ans) = 7-1-(1+2) = 4`.
  - Sequence becomes `[1, 2, 4]`.
  - Additional terms: `k+1 = 8` and `2*k+1 = 15`.
  - Remaining powers of `2`: `2^3 = 8` (already included as `k+1`).
  - Final sequence: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 15]`.

This sequence does not form all sums from `1` to `10` except `7`. For instance, `3` cannot be formed.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly in the general case when `k > 1`. The logic for avoiding `k` and ensuring all other sums can be formed is flawed.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
