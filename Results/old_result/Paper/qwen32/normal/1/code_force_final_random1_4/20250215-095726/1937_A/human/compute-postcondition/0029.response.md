To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```python
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer greater than 2
- `power` is 2

We need to ensure that `power < n` holds true for the loop to execute one more time. Since `power` is currently 2, we need to adjust `n` such that `n` is greater than 2.

Given that `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer greater than 2, the smallest possible value for `n` would be slightly more than 1 (since \(\log_2(2) = 1\) and we need an integer greater than 2). Therefore, the smallest possible value for `n` that satisfies the condition `power < n` would be slightly more than 2 (since \(\log_2(4) = 2\) and we need an integer greater than 2).

Thus, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. No other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`) need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**
