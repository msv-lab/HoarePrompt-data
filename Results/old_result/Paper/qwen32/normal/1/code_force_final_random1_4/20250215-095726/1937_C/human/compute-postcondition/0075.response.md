Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such response was received; if `res` is `'<'`, then `best` is 3, otherwise `best` remains 0; `res` is the value of the user's input; `i` is 3.**
