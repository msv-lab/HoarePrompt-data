Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1 and an odd length, and `test` is `True`. The current value of `test` is `True`.**
