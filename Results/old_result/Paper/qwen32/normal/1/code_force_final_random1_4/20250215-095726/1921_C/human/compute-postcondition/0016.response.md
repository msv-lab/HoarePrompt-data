The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` is now equal to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. Given that `n` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the current value of `i`.

Given that `n` is unchanged, we don't need to adjust `n`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, a new element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`.**

Since `i` has already been incremented in the previous iteration, we just need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n` for the loop to continue. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 1`), `n` is unchanged. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, a new element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`.**

To simplify, we can state:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `n` is unchanged.**

Since `i` has already been incremented, we just need to ensure `i` is less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `n` is unchanged.**

Given the context, the exact state of other variables like `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `arr`, etc., does not change in terms of the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `n` is unchanged.**

Simplified:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `n` is unchanged.**
