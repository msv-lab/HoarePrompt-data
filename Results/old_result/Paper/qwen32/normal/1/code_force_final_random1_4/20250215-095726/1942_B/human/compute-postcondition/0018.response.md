To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `res` and `mex` based on the input list `ar`.

### Loop Analysis
- The loop iterates over the indices of `ar` in reverse order (from the last index to the first).
- For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
- It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

### Iteration Details
- **First Iteration**: 
  - `i = len(ar) - 1`
  - `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`
  - `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`

- **Second Iteration**:
  - `i = len(ar) - 2`
  - `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`
  - `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`

- **Third Iteration**:
  - `i = len(ar) - 3`
  - `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`
  - `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`

This pattern continues until `i` reaches 0.

### Final Output State
After all iterations, the list `res` will have been filled with the values `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`, and `mex` will have been updated accordingly throughout the loop.

### Output State in the Required Format
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` elements; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation
After the loop finishes executing, the list `res` will contain the differences between the current `mex` and each element of `ar` in reverse order. The variable `mex` will hold the smallest value it took during the loop, which is the result of subtracting the largest possible `ar[i]` from the initial `mex` value (`n`). All other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
