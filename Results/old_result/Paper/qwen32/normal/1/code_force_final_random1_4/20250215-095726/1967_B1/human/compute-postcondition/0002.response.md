The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet provided.

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` will be the two integers read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**
