You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific condition involving the sum and count of elements in a sublist is met, printing 'YES' if the condition is satisfied and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine whether a subarray of the given array `c` is "good" according to the following criteria:
1. There exists an array `b` of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. No element in `b` should be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. All elements in `b` must be positive.

### Key Observations

- Since all elements in `c` are positive, we can always construct an array `b` where each element `b[i]` is either `a[i] + 1` or `a[i] - 1`, ensuring that `b[i]` is positive and different from `a[i]`.
- To satisfy the condition that the sum of `b` equals the sum of `a`, we need to ensure that the total increment or decrement across the subarray is zero.
- If the subarray has more than one element, it is always possible to adjust the values of `b` such that the sum remains the same and no element is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Single Element Subarrays**: 
   - For a single-element subarray, it is impossible to create a `b` array that satisfies the conditions because there is no way to change the value while keeping the sum the same and ensuring positivity.
   
2. **Multiple Element Subarrays**:
   - For subarrays with more than one element, we can adjust the values of `b` such that the sum remains unchanged. For example, if we have a subarray `[x, y]`, we can set `b = [x+1, y-1]` if `y > 1`. This ensures that the sum is the same (`x + y = (x+1) + (y-1)`), and no element is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.
   - If the subarray contains multiple elements, we can always find a way to distribute the increments and decrements so that the sum remains the same and all elements in `b` are positive.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. It also counts the number of ones in the subarray using another prefix sum array. The logic in the program checks if the subarray can be adjusted to meet the criteria by ensuring that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of ones in the subarray.

However, the program's logic for determining if a subarray is "good" is flawed. Specifically, the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` does not correctly account for the ability to adjust the values of `b` to meet the criteria for all subarrays with more than one element.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly determine if a subarray is "good" for all cases, particularly when the subarray contains only ones or when the adjustments required to make `b` different from `a` while maintaining the sum are not properly handled.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
