### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution is incorrect. The function summary confirms that the function calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` for each test case. However, this approach does not accurately compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem description.

The beauty of the array is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. The provided solution simplifies this by only considering the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not equivalent to the sum of all consecutive differences.

To illustrate why the solution is incorrect, let's consider the third example from the problem statement:

- Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
- Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Beauty: `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`

The provided solution would output `100-43=57`, which happens to be correct for this specific case, but this is coincidental and does not generalize correctly. For other arrays, the difference between the maximum and minimum values will not necessarily equal the sum of all consecutive differences.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem description. It only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the same as the sum of all consecutive differences in the sorted array.
