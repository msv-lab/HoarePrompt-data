The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and its value is between 1 and 50,000 inclusive. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are mentioned in the initial state but are not affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.**
