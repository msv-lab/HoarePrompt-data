The code snippet updates the value of `b` using the formula `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. This calculation does not affect the other variables, and their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Given the initial state, `b` is now calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is updated to `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. `b` is now `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**
