The given code snippet appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet. Therefore, only the value of `nx` changes.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 2`, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended to it.**
