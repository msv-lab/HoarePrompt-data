### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Overview of the Problem:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to recursively process a subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero and sets it to zero if true, appending the operation to `ops`.
   - If `l != r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If true, it sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the full range of the array.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` and sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum value.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Global Variable `a` and `ops`**: The functions `recursive_maximize_sum` and `func_1` use global variables `a` and `ops`. This is problematic because it makes the functions impure and hard to debug/test. They should take these variables as arguments.
- **Incorrect Return Values in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` incorrectly returns `sum(a), len(ops), ops`. However, `ops` is not defined within `func_2`. It seems like `ops` should be passed from `func_3` to `func_2` and then to `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- **Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The condition `if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1))` might not be correct. The idea should be to check if the current configuration can be improved by setting the subarray to its MEX. However, the current implementation does not calculate the MEX but rather sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of a subarray and set it accordingly. It also has issues with variable scope and incorrect return values. Therefore, the code does not solve the problem as intended.

### Correctness: **False**
