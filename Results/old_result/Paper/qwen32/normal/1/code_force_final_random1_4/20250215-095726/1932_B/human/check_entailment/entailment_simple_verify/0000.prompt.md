You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: A series of `t` lines, each line containing the final value of `year` after processing the list `a` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring periodically every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
- We need to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs using the following logic:
- Initialize `year` to 0.
- For each periodicity `ai` in the list of periodicities:
  - Update `year` to the next occurrence of the current sign, which is either the next multiple of `ai` after `year` or `ai` itself if `year` is 0.
- Print the final `year` for each test case.

### Code Review:
The key part of the code is:
```python
year += year % ai or ai
```
This line ensures that `year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` after the current `year`. Here’s how it works:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
- If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so we add `ai` to move to the next multiple.
- If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so we add the difference needed to reach the next multiple of `ai`.

### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the program against the provided example:

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Expected Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

#### Program Output:
Running the program with the above input produces the expected output.

### Edge Case Considerations:
- **Single Sign (`n=1`)**: The program correctly handles this case since it simply returns `a_1`.
- **All Signs Occur Every Year (`a_i=1`)**: The program correctly returns the year equal to the number of signs, as each sign occurs immediately after the previous one.
- **Large Periodicities**: The program should handle large values of `a_i` up to \(10^6\) without issues, as it only performs simple arithmetic operations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. It handles the example inputs correctly and seems robust against edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for each test case by iteratively updating the year to the next multiple of each sign's periodicity. It handles various scenarios, including single signs, signs occurring every year, and large periodicities, as demonstrated by the example inputs.
