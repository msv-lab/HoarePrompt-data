The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.

No other variables in the loop head (`n`) need to be adjusted since `n` remains constant throughout the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is updated based on its original value; `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `n` is `int(b[0])` and must be greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`; `i` is 2**
