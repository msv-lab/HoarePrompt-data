Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty; `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<'; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` includes the newly appended `i`.**
