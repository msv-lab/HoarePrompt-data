The code snippet `custo += b_values[y]` adds the value of `b_values[y]` to `custo`. Given that `y` is 2 and `b_values` is `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `b_values[2]` is 35. Therefore, `custo` which was initially 160, will be updated to 160 + 35, which equals 195.

Output State: **`custo` is 195, `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains 5, `max_p` remains 2, `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`, and `y` is 2.**
