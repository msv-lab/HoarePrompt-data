The code increments the variable `count_num` by 1. The values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`, `count_num` is incremented by 1.**
