Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 0.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain the outcomes (winners) for all `t` test cases. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last test case processed. The variable `winner` will store the result of the last call to `func_1(a, b)`. Finally, `t` will be 0 because the loop has executed `t` times.
