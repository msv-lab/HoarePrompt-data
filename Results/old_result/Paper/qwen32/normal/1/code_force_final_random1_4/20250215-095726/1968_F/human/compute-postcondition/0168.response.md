Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0; `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `q` is `int(data[idx - 1])` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n - 2 + i - 2*q - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.`**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `idx` has been incremented by 2. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
