The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Since the initial value of `k` is 1 and there is no information about the value of `i`, the value of `k` will now be whatever the value of `i` is. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is the value of `i`; `res` is `<`.**
