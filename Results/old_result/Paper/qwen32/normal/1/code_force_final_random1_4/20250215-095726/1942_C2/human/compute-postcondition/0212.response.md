Postcondition: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Additionally, `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`.**
