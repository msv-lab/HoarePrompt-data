The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `sb`. No changes are made to `i`, `n`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, or `sa`. Therefore, the only change is that `sb` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2` and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` has `i + 2` appended to it. `sb` has `i` appended to it.**
