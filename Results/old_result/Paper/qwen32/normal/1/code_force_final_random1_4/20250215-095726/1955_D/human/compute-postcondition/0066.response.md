The given code snippet only modifies the variable `curr` by decrementing its value by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `i` is incremented by 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is decreased by 1.**
