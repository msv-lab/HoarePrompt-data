The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, `t`, `a`, `b`) and their values, but these do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, `t` are assigned specific values, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The lists `a` and `b` are also defined but not utilized in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
