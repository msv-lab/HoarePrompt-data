### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the problem description to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the GCD of `n` sub-problems whose sum equals `x`.
- **Constraints**:
  - Number of test cases `t`: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
  - Difficulty `x`: \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\)
  - Number of sub-problems `n`: \(1 \leq n \leq x\)

#### Program Analysis Recap:
- The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
- For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be split into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` or `x // i`.
- It updates the maximum GCD found (`ans`) accordingly.

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program initializes `ans` to 1.
- It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x`.
- For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
- It also checks the symmetric divisor `x // i` under similar conditions.
- Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
1. **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the smallest possible GCD.
2. **Loop Through Divisors**: The loop runs from 1 to the square root of `x`, ensuring efficiency.
3. **Divisor Check**:
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. This ensures that the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the remaining sub-problems.
   - It also checks the symmetric divisor `x // i` to cover all possible divisors.
4. **Update Maximum GCD**: The program updates `ans` to the maximum value found during the iteration.

#### Testing with Provided Examples:
- **Test Case 1**: `1 10 3`
  - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
  - Feasible splits: 
    - `i = 1`: `10 - 3*1 = 7` (not divisible by 1)
    - `i = 2`: `10 - 3*2 = 4` (divisible by 2)
    - `i = 5`: `10 - 3*5 = -5` (negative)
    - `i = 10`: `10 - 3*10 = -20` (negative)
  - Symmetric check:
    - `x // 1 = 10`: `10 - 3*10 = -20` (negative)
    - `x // 2 = 5`: `10 - 3*5 = -5` (negative)
    - `x // 5 = 2`: `10 - 3*2 = 4` (divisible by 2)
    - `x // 10 = 1`: `10 - 3*1 = 7` (not divisible by 1)
  - Maximum GCD: 2 (from `i = 2` and `x // 5 = 2`)
- **Test Case 2**: `1 5 5`
  - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
  - Feasible splits:
    - `i = 1`: `5 - 5*1 = 0` (divisible by 1)
    - `i = 5`: `5 - 5*5 = -20` (negative)
  - Symmetric check:
    - `x // 1 = 5`: `5 - 5*5 = -20` (negative)
    - `x // 5 = 1`: `5 - 5*1 = 0` (divisible by 1)
  - Maximum GCD: 1 (from `i = 1` and `x // 5 = 1`)
- **Test Case 3**: `1 420 69`
  - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
  - Feasible splits:
    - `i = 6`: `420 - 69*6 = 6` (divisible by 6)
  - Symmetric check:
    - `x // 6 = 70`: `420 - 69*70 = -4710` (negative)
  - Maximum GCD: 6 (from `i = 6`)

#### Edge Cases:
- **Small `x` and `n`**: The program correctly handles small values, e.g., `1 1 1` results in `1`.
- **Large `x` and Small `n`**: The program correctly handles large `x` with small `n`, e.g., `1 100 1` results in `100`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD by iterating through potential divisors and checking the feasibility of splitting `x` into `n` parts. It handles edge cases and typical cases correctly, producing the expected output for all tested scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
