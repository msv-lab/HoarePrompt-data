Output State: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. `neighbor` is added to `visited`. `neighbor` is the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`. The `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**

In simple terms: The `queue` now has a new entry which is a tuple consisting of `neighbor` and `dist + 1`. All other conditions remain the same.
