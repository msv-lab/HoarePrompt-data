Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains incremented by 1 as per the initial state. The value of `stop` remains True. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. No other variables are affected.
