Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array \( a \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \). Let's analyze the program and provide a counterexample to demonstrate its incorrectness.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program initializes \( a[0] \) to 1000 and then sets each subsequent element \( a[i] \) to \( a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
According to the problem, we need to find an array \( a \) such that:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1 \)

Let's see what the program outputs for this input:
- \( a[0] = 1000 \)
- \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 1 = 1001 \)
- \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1001 + 1 = 1002 \)

So, the output array is \( [1000, 1001, 1002] \).

Now, let's check the conditions:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1001 \mod 1000 = 1 \) (This condition is satisfied.)
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1002 \mod 1001 = 1 \) (This condition is also satisfied.)

However, the issue arises with other inputs. Consider another input:
```
1
3
2 1
```
For this input, the program will output:
- \( a[0] = 1000 \)
- \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 2 = 1002 \)
- \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1002 + 1 = 1003 \)

So, the output array is \( [1000, 1002, 1003] \).

Now, let's check the conditions:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1002 \mod 1000 = 2 \) (This condition is not satisfied.)

Thus, the program fails to produce the correct array \( a \) for this input.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not satisfy the conditions for all possible inputs, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
