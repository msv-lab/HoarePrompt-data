To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in an `n x m` grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and changing all squares in the subrectangle defined by these two squares to that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Base Case**: If the grid is already uniform (all squares are the same color), the answer is trivially "YES".
2. **Non-uniform Grid**: If the grid is not uniform, the key observation is that the corners of the grid (`gr[0][0]`, `gr[0][m-1]`, `gr[n-1][0]`, `gr[n-1][m-1]`) play a crucial role.
   - If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different colors, then there must be a path of squares of the same color connecting these corners for it to be possible to make the entire grid uniform.
   - Specifically, either the top row or the bottom row should have all squares of the same color, and similarly, either the leftmost column or the rightmost column should have all squares of the same color.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the above logic:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself.
2. **Initial Assumption**: It assumes the answer is "YES".
3. **Corner Check**: If the top-left corner and bottom-right corner are different, it checks:
   - Whether all squares in the top row are the same.
   - Whether all squares in the bottom row are the same.
   - Whether all squares in the leftmost column are the same.
   - Whether all squares in the rightmost column are the same.
4. **Conclusion**: If none of the above conditions are met, it sets the answer to "NO".

### Correctness Check:
The logic in the program seems to correctly implement the observations mentioned above. However, there's a subtle issue:
- The program only checks the top and bottom rows, and the left and right columns, but it doesn't check if the entire grid can be made uniform based on these conditions.
- For example, consider a grid where the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, but there is a path of squares of the same color connecting these corners through other rows or columns. The current logic would incorrectly return "NO" in such cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program is not fully correct because it doesn't account for all possible paths that could make the entire grid uniform. Therefore, the program might give incorrect answers for certain edge cases.

**Correctness: False**
