Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, `lis` contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, `lis` contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True`. `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `lis` has at least 4 elements, its length is either odd or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has a length of 1, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, `lis` has either an odd or even length, `j` is set to `len(lis) - 1`, and `test` is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
