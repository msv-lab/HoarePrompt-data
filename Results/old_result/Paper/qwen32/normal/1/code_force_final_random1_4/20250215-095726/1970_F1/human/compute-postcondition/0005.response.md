Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid with `elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of two empty lists; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `points` has been updated to `[0, 0]`, indicating that both the blue and red teams start with a score of 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
