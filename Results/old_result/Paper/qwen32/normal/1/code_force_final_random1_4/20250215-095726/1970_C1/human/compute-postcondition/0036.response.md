The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` removes the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. Given that `rev[tmp]` was initially a non-empty list, after this operation, `rev[tmp]` will have one less element than before. The new value of `tmp` will be the element that was popped from `rev[tmp]`.

Since `tmp` was initially the last element of `rev[z]` and `rev[z]` had one less element than before, we can infer that `tmp` was updated to a new value which is the last element of the list `rev[tmp]` before the pop operation.

Output State: **`tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` before the pop operation; `rev[tmp]` is a list with one less element than before; `one` is either `True` or `False`; `two` is `True`; `rev[z]` is a list with one less element than before.**
