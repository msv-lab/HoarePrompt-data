a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers (n, m1, m2, p_list, s_list) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, the number of suffix maximums, the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, respectively. b is not used in the function as per the provided function definition. It is guaranteed that for each tuple, 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, p_list and s_list are lists of integers satisfying 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n, and both p_list and s_list are in strictly increasing order.
