The code snippet provided increments the value of `curr` by 1. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`) are modified in the given code snippet.

Given the initial state, `i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, and the conditions related to `a[m + 2]`, `b_values`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the line `curr += 1`.

Therefore, the only change is that `curr` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`. If `a[m + 2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `cnt_b[a[2m + 2]]` is decreased by 1. `curr` is increased by 1.**
