The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is already defined as `a[i]`, this operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

The other variables (`i`, `opNum`, and `stop`) are not directly modified by this line of code. However, the condition that affects `stop` (whether `a[i]` is less than 0) is no longer relevant because `a[i]` is now 0, which does not meet the condition for setting `stop` to True.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `opNum` is `a[i]`; `a[i]` is 0; `stop` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `a[i]` was originally less than 0.**

However, since `a[i]` is now 0, the condition for setting `stop` to True is no longer met. Thus, the accurate output state is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `opNum` is `a[i]`; `a[i]` is 0; `stop` remains unchanged unless it was already True due to a previous condition.**
