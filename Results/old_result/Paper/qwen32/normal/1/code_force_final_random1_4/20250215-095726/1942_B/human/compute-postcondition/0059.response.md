To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current context of the `print` statement directly.
2. **`n`**: An input integer representing the length of the list `ar`.
3. **`ar`**: A list of integers of length `n`.
4. **`res`**: A list of length `n` where each `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` for `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.
5. **`mex`**: The smallest non-negative integer that was not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop.

### Calculation of `res` and `mex`:

- The list `res` is populated in reverse order, starting from the last element of `ar` to the first.
- For each element `ar[i]` in `ar`, `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
- The `mex` value is determined dynamically during this process. It starts at 0 and increments whenever the current `mex - ar[i]` value is already present in `res`.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `ar = [1, 2, 3]` for simplicity:

1. Initialize `res` as an empty list and `mex` as 0.
2. Start from the last element of `ar`:
   - For `ar[2] = 3`: `mex - ar[2] = 0 - 3 = -3`. Since `-3` is not in `res`, `res` becomes `[-3]` and `mex` remains 0.
   - For `ar[1] = 2`: `mex - ar[1] = 0 - 2 = -2`. Since `-2` is not in `res`, `res` becomes `[-2, -3]` and `mex` remains 0.
   - For `ar[0] = 1`: `mex - ar[0] = 0 - 1 = -1`. Since `-1` is not in `res`, `res` becomes `[-1, -2, -3]` and `mex` remains 0.

In this example, `mex` did not need to increment because none of the calculated values were already in `res`.

### General Case:

For any given list `ar`, the `res` list is constructed such that each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`. The `mex` value is adjusted to ensure that all values in `res` are unique and non-negative.

### Final Print Statement:

The `print` statement joins the elements of `res` into a single string separated by spaces and prints it.

### Output Description:

Given the above logic, the output will be a space-separated string of integers where each integer is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.

Output: **res (where res is a list of integers calculated as mex - ar[i] for i from len(ar) - 1 to 0, with mex being the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form mex - ar[i])**
