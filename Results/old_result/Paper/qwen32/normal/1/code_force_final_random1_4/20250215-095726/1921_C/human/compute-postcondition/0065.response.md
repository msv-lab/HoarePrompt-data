The code appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this value to `array2`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged except for the increment in `i` which was already accounted for in the initial state description. The only change is the addition of the new element to `array2`.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 2`, `array2` has a new element appended which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
