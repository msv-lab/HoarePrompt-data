To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only assume that it could potentially modify the variables in the environment or perform some operations without affecting the variables explicitly mentioned in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4

And the code snippet:
```
func_1()
```

Since there is no information about what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine any changes to the variable `t` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**.
