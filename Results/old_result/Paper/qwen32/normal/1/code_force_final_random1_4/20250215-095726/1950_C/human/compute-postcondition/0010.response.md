Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the input string.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
- `h` is not equal to '00'.
- `h` is greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `h`:**
   - `h` is the first two characters of the string `s`.
   - It is given that `h` is greater than 12, so `h` must be a string representing a number between 13 and 23 (inclusive).

2. **Conversion and Calculation:**
   - `int(h)` converts the string `h` to an integer.
   - `int(h) - 12` subtracts 12 from this integer value.

3. **Formatting and Printing:**
   - `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)` formats the result of the subtraction with a leading '0'.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that no newline character is added after the print statement.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `h` is "15".
  - `int("15")` is 15.
  - `15 - 12` is 3.
  - `'0{}'.format(3)` results in the string "03".

### General Case:
- For any valid `h` (13 to 23), the expression `int(h) - 12` will result in a number between 1 and 11.
- The formatted string will always have a leading '0', making the output a two-character string where the first character is '0' and the second character is the result of the subtraction.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the code, the output will always be a two-character string starting with '0' followed by a single digit number resulting from `int(h) - 12`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0[int(h) - 12] (where int(h) - 12 is a number between 1 and 11)**
