The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value stored at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is the element at index `i` in the list `a`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, and the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'; `a[1]` is incremented by 1.**
