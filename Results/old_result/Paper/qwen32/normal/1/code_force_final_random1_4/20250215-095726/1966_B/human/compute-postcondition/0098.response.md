Output State: **t is an integer such that t >= 1, n must be greater than or equal to i + 1, m is the second integer from the new input, gr is a list containing n elements (all inputs provided during the loop), tc is incremented by 1 for each iteration, impossible remains unchanged, i is n - 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer that is at least 1.
- The variable `n` must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has completed, meaning it is at least as large as `i + 1` where `i` is the loop counter.
- The variable `m` retains its value from the second integer of the new input.
- The list `gr` contains exactly `n` elements, each representing the input strings provided during each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `tc` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `impossible` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
- The loop counter `i` will have reached the value of `n - 1`, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
