Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `mex` and `i` remain unchanged.**
