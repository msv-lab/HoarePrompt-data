The given code snippet modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]` to it. Here, `i` is initialized to `t`, and `N` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `pd[i]` (which is `pd[t]`) will be updated to `pd[t] + pd[t - 1]`. The values of `t`, `N`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` remains the same as the input integer, `N`: 200001, `i`: `t`, `pd[t]` is now `pd[t] + pd[t - 1]`**.
