Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

#### Function Definition and Call Order
The program starts with `func_1()` before defining the function `func_1`. This indeed results in a `NameError` because the function is called before it is defined. This is a critical issue that prevents the program from running correctly.

#### Handling of Hours
- **When `h == '00'`**: The program correctly prints `'12'`.
- **When `int(h) <= 12`**: The program correctly prints `h`.
- **When `int(h) > 12`**: The program attempts to format the hour by subtracting 12 and prefixing with '0'. However, there are a few issues:
  - If `h` is '13', it will print `'01'`, which is correct.
  - If `h` is '12', it should print `'12 PM'`, but the current logic will print `'00 PM'` due to the formatting issue.

#### AM/PM Selection
- The selection between 'AM' and 'PM' is done using `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`. This logic is mostly correct except for the special case when `h` is '12'. According to the 12-hour clock format, '12:XX PM' should be used for '12:XX' in 24-hour format, and '12:XX AM' should be used for '00:XX' in 24-hour format. The current implementation will print '12:XX PM' for both '00:XX' and '12:XX'.

### Annotations Evaluation
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points. They indicate that the program processes each test case and prints the time in the required format. However, they do not address the critical issues identified above, particularly the function definition and call order and the handling of the '12' hour.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:
- It defines the function before calling it.
- It correctly handles the conversion of hours, including the special cases for '00' and '12'.
- It uses formatted strings to ensure the correct output format.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the function definition and call order issue and the incorrect handling of the '12' hour. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
