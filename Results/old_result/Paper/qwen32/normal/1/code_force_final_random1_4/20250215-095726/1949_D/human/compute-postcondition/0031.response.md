The code snippet provided appends the string `x` to the list `xx`. This operation does not affect the arrays `a` and `b` or the string `x` itself, but it does modify the list `xx` by adding `x` to it.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `xx` now includes the string `x` as its last element.

Output State: **`a` and `b` arrays are updated based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the string `x` from positions 1 to `n`; `xx` includes the string `x` as its last element.**
