Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
