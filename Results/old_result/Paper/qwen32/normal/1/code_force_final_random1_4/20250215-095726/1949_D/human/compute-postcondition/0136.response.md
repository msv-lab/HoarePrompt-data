The code snippet provided appends the character 'S' to the variable `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` changes from its previous state to its current value plus 'S'. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus 'S'.**
