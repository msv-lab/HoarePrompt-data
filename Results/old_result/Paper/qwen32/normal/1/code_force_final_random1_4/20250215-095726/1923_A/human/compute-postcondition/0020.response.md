The code snippet updates the value of `z` based on the indices `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, `z` is recalculated as the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to (but not including) index `n - y`.

If `x` is -1, it means '1' was not found in the original `arr`, and thus `z` remains an empty string. Otherwise, `z` is set to the substring from `x` to `n - y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 998\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
