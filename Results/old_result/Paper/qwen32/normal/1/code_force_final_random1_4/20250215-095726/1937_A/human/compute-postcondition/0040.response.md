Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, and `n` is the integer provided by the user. If `n` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `n`. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, and `power` is equal to `n` if the original `power` was equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` is equal to `n - 1`.**
