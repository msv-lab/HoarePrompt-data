Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is 0, indicating that the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set.**
