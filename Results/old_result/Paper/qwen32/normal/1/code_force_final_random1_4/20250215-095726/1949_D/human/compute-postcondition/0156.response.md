Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`. Additionally, `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4]`.**

Natural Language: The variable `nx` has been updated to 'S'. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains `n`, and `n` is still required to be greater than or equal to 1. The condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?` is still valid, and the conditions that `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4]` also remain true.
