The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value stored in the dictionary `cnt_b` at the key `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, the key used in the dictionary will be `a[2]`. The value at this key in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1.

Since the exact value of `a[2]` and the value in `cnt_b` at that key are not specified, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables. The other variables (`i` and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decreased by 1.**
