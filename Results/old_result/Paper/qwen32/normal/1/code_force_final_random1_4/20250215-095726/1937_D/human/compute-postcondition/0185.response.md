The given code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its current value. Let's break down the changes:

- `b` was initially `B[r]`.
- After executing `b = b - B[r - l]`, the new value of `b` becomes `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

No other variables are modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.**
