Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `res` is a string that could be `<` or any other string.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to `i`; otherwise, `k` remains 1.
- `i` is calculated as `i_prev + 2`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

#### Variables to Determine:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string and will always be printed as `?`.
- `0`: This is a literal integer and will always be printed as `0`.
- `k`: This depends on the value of `res`.
  - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is equal to `i`.
  - Otherwise, `k` is `1`.
- `0`: This is another literal integer and will always be printed as `0`.
- `i`: This is calculated as `i_prev + 2`.

### Output Description:
Given the initial state, we know the following:
- The first two and last elements of the print statement are fixed literals (`?`, `0`, `0`).
- The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `<`, `k` will be the value of `i`.
  - Otherwise, `k` will be `1`.
- The value of `i` is determined by `i_prev + 2`.

Since `i_prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only express `i` in terms of `i_prev`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is i if res is '<', otherwise k is 1, and i is i_prev + 2)**
