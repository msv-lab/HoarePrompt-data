To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, only `i` needs to be adjusted.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4
- `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'
- `s` is the newly input string
- `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`
- `z` is the count of '0's in `s`
- `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0
- `one` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0
- `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged
- `mini` is 100000000
- `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`.
- The current character at index `i` in the string `s` is either '0' or '1'
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`
- If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` includes `i + 1`.

We only need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the newly input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in the string `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged; `mini` is 100000000; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
