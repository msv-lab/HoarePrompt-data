To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the context:

1. **Variables and Initial Values:**
   - `t` is initialized to 0.
   - `N` is set to 200,001.
   - `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` (for `i` from 1 to 200,000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.
   - `i` is set to 200,001.
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Understanding `pd`:**
   - `pd` is a list where each element `pd[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.
   - For example, if `i = 5`, then `pd[5]` would be the sum of the digits of the numbers 1 through 5, i.e., `1 + (2) + (3) + (4) + (5) = 15`.

3. **What is Printed:**
   - The statement `print(pd[n])` will print the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given that `pd` is precomputed up to `i = 200,000`, the value of `pd[n]` can be directly accessed if `n` is between 1 and 200,000 inclusive.

**Output Description:**
- The code prints the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `pd[n]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the precomputed cumulative sum stored in `pd[n]`.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n)**
