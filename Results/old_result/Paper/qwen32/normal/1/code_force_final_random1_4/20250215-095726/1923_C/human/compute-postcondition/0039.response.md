To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer.
   - `m`: Initially `m`, but then it becomes `m - 1`.
   - `l`: A list of integers.
   - `p`: A list starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
   - `c`: A list starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from input.
   - `s`: Calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.
   - `i`: Calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, representing the count of `1`s in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.
   - `j`: The total count of `1`s in `l`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement will execute if both of the following conditions hold:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1`
     - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will output `'YES'` only if the length of the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` is greater than 1 and the sum of the subarray minus its length is greater than or equal to the count of `1`s in that subarray.

However, the problem statement does not specify the exact values of `a`, `b`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `s`, and `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of these variables. But based on the conditions provided, if these conditions are met, the output will be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
