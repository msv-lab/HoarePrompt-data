#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between infoA.balance and infoB.balance, where infoA.balance is not equal to infoB.balance.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each having attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance` if they are not equal. If `infoA.balance` equals `infoB.balance`, it returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which results in 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an instance of `BalanceInfo` with the balance, index, and character at that index; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string formed by joining the characters from `balance_info` in the specified order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters based on their balance and position values. The final output is a rearranged version of the input string, not the maximum depth of nested parentheses.
