Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `s[1]`, `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[1]`, `cur` is 0.`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` has been updated to include the value of `ss`, which is the second character of the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
