In the given task, the for loop iterates over `n_cases`, which is set to the value of `t`. The loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n_cases - 1`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n_cases` (or equivalently `t`) is at least 1. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` or `n_cases` to ensure the loop executes.

The loop variable `i` is automatically initialized to 0 before the loop starts and will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n_cases - 1`. Thus, there is no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts is already appropriate for the loop to execute. However, if we were to explicitly state the necessary conditions based on the loop head, we would say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0**

This state ensures that the loop will execute since `n_cases` (which is `t`) is at least 1, and `i` is correctly initialized to 0.
