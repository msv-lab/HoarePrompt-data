To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `score` is `l[i + 2] + l[i]`.

Let's analyze the loop:
- The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `i < 2 * n`.

From the given information, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 2.

Since `i` is `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had before being incremented by 2 in the previous iteration. Let's denote the value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `i_prev + 2`.

For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 4`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can infer that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the current value of `i` (which is `i + 2` from the previous iteration) plus 2 again, effectively making it `i + 4`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i + 4`.
- `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

Other variables like `t`, `l`, and `score` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 4`**
