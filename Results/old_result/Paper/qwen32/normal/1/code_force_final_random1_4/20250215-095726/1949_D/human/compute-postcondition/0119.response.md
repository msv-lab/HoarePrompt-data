Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` remains the same. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` now includes the new value of `i`.**
