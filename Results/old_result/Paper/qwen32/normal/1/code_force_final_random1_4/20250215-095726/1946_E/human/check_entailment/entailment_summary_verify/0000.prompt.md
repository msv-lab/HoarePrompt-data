You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

The following permutations are suitable for the second set of input data:

  * [1, 4, 3, 2] 
  * [2, 4, 3, 1] 
  * [3, 4, 2, 1] 

The following permutations are suitable for the sixth set of input data:

  * [2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4] 
  * [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4] 
  * [3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4] 
  * [4, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3] 
  * [4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3] 
  * [4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2] 
  * [5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3] 
  * [5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3] 
  * [5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2] 
  * [5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2]

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    if a < b:
        (c, d) = func_1(b, a)
        return (d, c)
    if a % b == 0:
        return (1, -(a // b - 1))
    (c, d) = func_1(b, a % b)
    return (d, c - a // b * d)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    (c, d) = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the product of `a` and the first value `c` returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, then returns this product modulo 1000000007.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not address the problem description at all. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. However, the given code consists of two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that seem to be related to modular arithmetic and greatest common divisors (GCD), but they do not solve the problem of counting permutations with given prefix and suffix maximums.

To solve the problem, we would need to implement a solution that takes into account the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. The current code does not handle any of the logic needed to count valid permutations, so it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.
