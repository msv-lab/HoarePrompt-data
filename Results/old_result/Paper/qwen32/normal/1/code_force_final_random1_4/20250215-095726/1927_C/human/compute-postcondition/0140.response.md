Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i=2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**
