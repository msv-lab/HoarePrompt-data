The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2.
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, `j` should now be 3.

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3**
