You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input from the last iteration, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is equal to `t`. The loop has printed `t` lines, each containing the constructed `word` based on the respective `n` value from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78). It then constructs and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The final state of the program is that it has processed all `t` test cases and printed the corresponding strings.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given encoded integer `n`.
- The sum `n` is calculated as the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
- The letters are indexed from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z').
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `n`.
3. Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs a 3-letter word:
   - If `n > 52`, it sets the first letter to `alphabet[n - 53]` and the last two letters to 'zz'.
   - If `52 >= n > 26`, it sets the first letter to 'a', the second letter to `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the third letter to 'z'.
   - If `n <= 26`, it sets the first two letters to 'aa' and the third letter to `alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the provided logic correctly handles all possible values of `n` within the given constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

1. **Case 1: n > 52**
   - For `n > 52`, the formula `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` seems incorrect. 
   - The maximum value for `n` is 78, so `n - 53` can be at most 25, which corresponds to 'z'. 
   - However, the formula does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `n = 78`, the formula gives 'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz', but the correct answer should be 'rzz'.

2. **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**
   - For `26 < n ≤ 52`, the formula `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` is also incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 52`, the formula gives 'a' + 'y' + 'z' = 'ayz', but the correct answer should be 'czz'.

3. **Case 3: n ≤ 26**
   - For `n ≤ 26`, the formula `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` is incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 3`, the formula gives 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa', which is correct, but this is a special case and doesn't generalize well.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
