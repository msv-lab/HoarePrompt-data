To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters `1` and `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- A string of length `n` is constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` or 'F'/'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`.
- The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on the value it had during that iteration. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `1 <= k <= n`).
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` should now be `k + 1`. This means `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
3. **Range Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be such that `i < n + 1`.

Given these points, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to `n` or the construction of the string, we only need to adjust `i`.

**Answer**:
State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` or 'F'/'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, to provide a more concrete example, let's assume `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `4`.

**Concrete Example**:
If `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` or 'F'/'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is 4**

In general, without knowing the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can say:
State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` or 'F'/'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
