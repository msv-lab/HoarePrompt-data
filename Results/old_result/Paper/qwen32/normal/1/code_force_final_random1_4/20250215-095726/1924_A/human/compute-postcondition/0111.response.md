To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the components of the `ans` string based on the initial state provided:

1. **`ans` Construction**:
   - `ans` is constructed as a string that contains:
     - The last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters.
     - The value of `tmp`.
     - `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.

2. **`tmp` Calculation**:
   - `tmp` is either `'a' + (k - 1)` characters or an empty string.
   - `tmp` is `'a' + (k - 1)` characters if the k-th bit of `cur` is not set.
   - `tmp` is an empty string if the k-th bit of `cur` is set.

3. **`cur` State**:
   - `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.
   - If `cur` is 0, it means the k-th bit is not set, so `tmp` would be `'a' + (k - 1)` characters.
   - If `cur` is not 0, it means the k-th bit is set, so `tmp` would be an empty string.

4. **Sequences of Unique Characters**:
   - The sequences of `k` unique characters are derived from the string `s`.
   - For each sequence, the last character is added to `ans`.

5. **Appending 'a' Characters**:
   - After adding the last character from each sequence and `tmp`, `ans` appends `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.
   - `cnt` is the number of sequences processed so far.

Given these points, let's construct the output:

- **Last Character from Each Sequence**: This part of `ans` depends on the specific sequences found in `s`. Since `s` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact characters. However, we know they are the last characters of each sequence of `k` unique characters.
  
- **`tmp` Value**: This depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is 0, `tmp` is `'a' + (k - 1)` characters. If `cur` is not 0, `tmp` is an empty string.

- **Appending 'a' Characters**: This part of `ans` is `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.

Since we don't have the exact values of `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, and `n`, we can only describe the structure of `ans`:

Output: **[last characters from each sequence of k unique characters] + [tmp (where tmp is 'a' + (k - 1) if the k-th bit of cur is not set, otherwise tmp is an empty string)] + [(n - cnt - 1) 'a' characters]**
