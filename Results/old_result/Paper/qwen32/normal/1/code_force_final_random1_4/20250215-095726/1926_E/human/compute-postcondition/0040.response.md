The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` is a non-zero integer, the exact value of `m` depends on the value of `n`. However, we can express `m` directly in terms of `n`.

Other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 4; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is an input integer; `L` is []; `tot` is 3; `pow` is 32; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
