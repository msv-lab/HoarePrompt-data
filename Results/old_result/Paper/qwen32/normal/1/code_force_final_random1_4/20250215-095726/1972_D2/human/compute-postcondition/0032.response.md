Let's calculate the impact of the code on the variables:

Given:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, calculate the two expressions inside the `min` function:
1. `n / ((x + y) * x)`
   - `(x + y) * x` evaluates to `(1 + 3) * 1 = 4`
   - `n / 4` evaluates to `5 / 4 = 1.25`

2. `m // ((x + y) * y)`
   - `(x + y) * y` evaluates to `(1 + 3) * 3 = 12`
   - `m // 12` evaluates to `20 // 12 = 1` (integer division)

The `min` function will take the smaller of these two values, which is `1`.

Thus, `cnt` is incremented by `1`.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
