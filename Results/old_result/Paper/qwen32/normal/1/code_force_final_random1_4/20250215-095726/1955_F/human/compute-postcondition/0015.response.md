The code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers obtained from the user input. This means the original values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, and `a` are replaced by the new values provided by the user. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged because it was calculated based on the previous values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4` are the first four elements of the new list `a` respectively, `cnt` is `math.floor(p_1 / 2) + math.floor(p_2 / 2) + math.floor(p_3 / 2) + math.floor(p_4 / 2)` based on the previous values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4`.**
