The function takes a list of integers `a` as input, computes the sum of all integers in the list, and returns a tuple containing this sum, the length of an operations list `ops`, and the `ops` list itself. The operations list `ops` is not modified or used within the provided code snippet, so its length will be zero and it will be empty.
