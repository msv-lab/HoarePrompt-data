Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an `n x m` grid of squares, each colored either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black).
- An operation allows us to select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using any number of such operations.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid. It checks if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on certain conditions.

#### Key Logic:
1. **Initial Check**: If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are different colors, the program proceeds to check further conditions.
2. **Horizontal Check**: It checks if all adjacent cells in the first row and last row are the same color.
3. **Vertical Check**: It checks if all adjacent cells in the first column and last column are the same color.
4. **Conclusion**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different but the horizontal and vertical checks fail, it concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

### Potential Issues:
The program seems to rely heavily on the top-left and bottom-right corners and their adjacent cells. However, this approach might not cover all scenarios where making the entire grid the same color is still possible.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
- Top-left corner is 'W', bottom-right corner is 'B'.
- Horizontal check fails because `gr[0][0] != gr[0][1]` and `gr[1][0] != gr[1][1]`.
- Vertical check fails because `gr[0][0] != gr[1][0]` and `gr[0][1] != gr[1][1]`.

According to the program, this would result in "NO". However, it is actually possible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (2, 2) to color the subrectangle (1, 1) to (2, 2) with 'B'.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (2, 1) to color the subrectangle (1, 2) to (2, 1) with 'W'.

After these operations, the grid becomes:
```
WW
BB
```
Then, we can select positions (1, 1) and (2, 2) again to color the entire grid with 'W' or 'B'.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to recognize scenarios where making the entire grid the same color is possible despite the top-left and bottom-right corners being different.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color in certain cases, such as the counterexample provided above.
