The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the iterable `num`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `num`, the state of `i` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `num` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1.
- `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2.
- `num` is a list containing at least one element.
- `count_num` is 0 if `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 and `i` is between `start` and `end` inclusive.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to move `i` to the next element in `num`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, and `count_num`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Let's assume that the current value of `i` is the first element of `num`. After the first iteration, `i` would be the second element of `num`, and so on.

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`, `count_num` is 0 if `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 and `i` is between `start` and `end` inclusive.**

Since we don't know the exact elements of `num` or the current value of `i`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`.**
