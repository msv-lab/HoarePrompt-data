Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`; `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters; `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second such that `k > 2 * delta`; `n` is the length of the list `a` and is greater than 0; `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`; `distance` is 0; `pos` is either 1, 2, or 3; `rest` is `k - 3 * delta`; `delta` is `min(k - 2 * delta, a[sorted_indices[pos-1]])`.**

Explanation: The value of `pos` is incremented by 1, so if `pos` was initially 0, it becomes 1; if `pos` was initially 1, it becomes 2; and if `pos` was initially 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `delta` is recalculated based on the new `pos` value, specifically `delta` is now `min(k - 2 * delta, a[sorted_indices[pos-1]])`.
