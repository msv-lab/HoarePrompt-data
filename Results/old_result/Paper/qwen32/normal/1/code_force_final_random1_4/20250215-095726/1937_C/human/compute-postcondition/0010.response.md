To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 2.
3. **`res`**: A string that can be either `<` or some other value.
4. **`k`**: 
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to the value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `k` remains 1.
5. **`i`**: Defined as `i_prev + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs a series of values separated by spaces.
- The first value is a literal `'?'`.
- The second value is a literal `0`.
- The third value is `k`.
- The fourth value is a literal `0`.
- The fifth value is `i`.

### Determining the Values:
- The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `<`, `k` is equal to `i`.
  - Otherwise, `k` is `1`.
- The value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`, but since `i_prev` is not explicitly given, we can only express `i` in terms of `i_prev`.

### Final Output Description:
- Since the exact values of `res` and `i_prev` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `k` and `i`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is i if res is '<', otherwise k is 1, and i is i_prev + 1)**
