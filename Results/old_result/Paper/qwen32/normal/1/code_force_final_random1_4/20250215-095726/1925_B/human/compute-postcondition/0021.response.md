Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is `i_old + 1`. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
