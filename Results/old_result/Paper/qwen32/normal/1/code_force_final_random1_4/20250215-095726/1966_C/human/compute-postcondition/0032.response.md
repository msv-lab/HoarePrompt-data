The code snippet sets `dp` to `True`. This change affects the value of `dp` while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 1; `n` is the input integer; `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-2`; `dp` is `True`.**
