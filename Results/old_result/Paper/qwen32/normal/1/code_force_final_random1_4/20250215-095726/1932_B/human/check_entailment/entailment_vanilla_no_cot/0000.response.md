To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic against the problem statement.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`. It initializes a variable `year` to 0, which represents the current year. For each sign's periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by adding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year` to `year`. This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

Let's break down this expression:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
- If `year % ai` is not zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and we need to add the difference to make it the next multiple of `ai`. This difference is `ai - (year % ai)`, but since we are adding `year % ai` to `year` first, we can simply add `ai` and then subtract `year % ai` implicitly.
- If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and we just need to add `ai` to get the next occurrence.

The expression `year += year % ai or ai` effectively adds the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year + 1` to `year`, which is exactly what we need according to the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen for each test case.

Thus, the response is:
Correctness: **True**
