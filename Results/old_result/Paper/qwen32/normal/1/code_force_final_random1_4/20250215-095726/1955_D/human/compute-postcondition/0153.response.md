The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
