Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`.**

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `m` will be 0 because the loop runs `m` times and each iteration decrements `m` implicitly by one through the loop construct `for _ in range(m):`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body. Specifically, `i` remains the sum of all elements in `l`, and `j` remains the count of `1`s in `l`.
