Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `ss`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
