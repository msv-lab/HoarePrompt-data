Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is `previous_j + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `impossible` is explicitly set to `False` by the code snippet, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
