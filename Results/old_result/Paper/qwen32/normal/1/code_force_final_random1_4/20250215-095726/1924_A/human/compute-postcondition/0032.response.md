Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of the new `ss` in the alphabet, calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string containing the character `ss`. Otherwise, `cur` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
