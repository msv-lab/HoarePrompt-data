The code snippet appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `nx` will contain the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.

The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `nx` is `xx[5][j - 1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
