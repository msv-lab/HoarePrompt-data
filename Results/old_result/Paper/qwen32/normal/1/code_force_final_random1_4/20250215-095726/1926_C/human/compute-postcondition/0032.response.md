The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` will take on the value of whatever integer is input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `pd`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`, `i` is 200001, `n` is an input integer.**
