The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means the original value of `s` is replaced by the new input string.

Given the initial conditions, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only change is that `s` now holds the newly input string, which consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and has a length of `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets**.
