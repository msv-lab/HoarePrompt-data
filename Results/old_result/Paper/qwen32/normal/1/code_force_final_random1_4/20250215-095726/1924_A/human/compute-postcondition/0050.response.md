The `break` statement in the provided code does not affect any of the variables directly. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given context, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
