Given the provided initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

The code snippet updates the value of `zero_perc`. It calculates `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, where `i` is 4. This means the denominator is `4 + 1 = 5`.

Therefore, `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // 5`.

Other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` remains the same; `one` is set to 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and set to 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'; `lst` is `[i + 1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 5`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is 4.**
