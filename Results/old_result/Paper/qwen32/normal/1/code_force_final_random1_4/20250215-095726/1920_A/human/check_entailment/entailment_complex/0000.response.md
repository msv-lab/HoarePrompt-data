### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Overview of the Program:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads a number of constraints and processes them.
- It keeps track of the minimum and maximum values for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
- It collects values that `k` cannot be (constraints of type 3).
- It then calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`n`).
   - It then reads `n` constraints, each consisting of a type (`a`) and a value (`x`).

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates the `start` variable to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates the `end` variable to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the list `num` of values that `k` cannot be.

3. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - It counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - This count is stored in `count_num`.

4. **Calculating Valid Integers:**
   - If `start > end`, it means there are no valid integers, so it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts `count_num` (the number of invalid values within this range).
   - It ensures that the result is not negative by returning 0 if the calculated value is less than 0.

#### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the implementation against the example test cases provided:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 3`, `2 10`, `3 1`, `3 5`
   - `start = 3`, `end = 10`, `num = [1, 5]`
   - Valid integers: `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` (7 integers)
   - Result: 7

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 4`
   - `start = 5`, `end = 4`
   - Since `start > end`, result: 0

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `3 6`, `3 7`, `1 2`, `1 7`, `3 100`, `3 44`, `2 100`, `2 98`, `1 3`, `3 99`
   - `start = 7`, `end = 98`, `num = [6, 7, 100, 44, 99]`
   - Valid integers: `8, 9, ..., 97` (90 integers)
   - Result: 90

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 5`, `2 10`, `1 9`, `2 2`, `3 2`, `3 9`
   - `start = 9`, `end = 2`
   - Since `start > end`, result: 0

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 1`, `2 2`, `3 1`, `3 2`, `3 3`
   - `start = 1`, `end = 2`, `num = [1, 2, 3]`
   - No valid integers
   - Result: 0

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `1 10000`, `2 900000000`, `3 500000000`, `1 100000000`, `3 10000`, `3 900000001`
   - `start = 100000000`, `end = 900000000`, `num = [500000000, 10000, 900000001]`
   - Valid integers: `100000000, 100000001, ..., 899999999` (800000000 integers)
   - Result: 800000000

All test cases match the expected results, confirming that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
