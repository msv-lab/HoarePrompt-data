To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` must be greater than 0.
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet letters.
- `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`.
- `ans` is an empty list with one additional element which is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.
- `j` is 1.

Code snippet:
```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

This line appends a new element to the `ans` list. The element is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` (which includes `rev_array[j]` and all elements after it), subtracting 1 from this count, and using the result as an index to access an element in the `alp` list.

Let's denote:
- `count_value` as `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])`.
- `index_value` as `count_value - 1`.

The new element appended to `ans` is `alp[index_value]`.

Since `ans` initially had one element, after appending the new element, `ans` will have two elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet letters, `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, `j` is 1.**
