The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `nx` contains a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on the given conditions.
- The loop variable `i` was used in the previous iteration.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we simply need to increase the value of `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`nx` contains a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on the given conditions, `i` is `k + 1`**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` (other than it being the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`nx` contains a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on the given conditions, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `4`.

So, assuming `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`nx` contains a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on the given conditions, `i` is `k + 1`**.

If we need a concrete example, let's say `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`nx` contains a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on the given conditions, `i` is 4**.
