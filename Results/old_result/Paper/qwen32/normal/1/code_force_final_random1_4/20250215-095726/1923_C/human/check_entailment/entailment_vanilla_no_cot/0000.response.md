To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a given subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good" according to the following criteria:
1. There exists an array `b` of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Every element in `b` must be different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. Every element in `b` must be greater than 0.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
Let's break down the code and see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation (`p`)**:
   - The variable `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array `l`. This allows us to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray using `p[r] - p[l-1]`.

2. **Count of Ones (`c`)**:
   - The variable `c` is used to store the cumulative count of ones up to each position in the array `l`. This allows us to quickly count the number of ones in any subarray using `c[r] - c[l-1]`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the code calculates the sum of the subarray `s` and the count of ones `i` within the subarray.
   - It then checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that satisfies the conditions:
     - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
     - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` checks if the remaining sum after subtracting the number of elements (which must be at least 1 each) is sufficient to ensure that no element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray. Specifically, if there are `i` ones in the subarray, the remaining sum must be enough to make all these ones different (by at least 1).

### Correctness Check:
The logic seems to be based on the idea that if a subarray has a sum `s` and `i` ones, and if `s - (length of subarray)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then it is possible to construct an array `b` where all elements are greater than 0 and different from the corresponding elements in the subarray.

However, there is a subtle issue with the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`. This condition does not fully guarantee that we can construct an array `b` where all elements are different from the corresponding elements in the subarray, especially when there are elements other than 1 in the subarray.

### Counterexample:
Consider the subarray `[2, 2]`. The sum `s` is 4, and the length of the subarray is 2. According to the condition, `4 - 2 >= 0` which is true, but we cannot construct an array `b` where both elements are different from 2 and still maintain the sum of 4 with all elements being positive.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and might produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
