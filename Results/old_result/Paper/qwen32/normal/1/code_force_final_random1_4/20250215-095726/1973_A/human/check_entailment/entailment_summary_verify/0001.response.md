Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. Total Points Calculation:
- The program calculates the total points using `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
- This is correct since each game contributes either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw).

#### 2. Total Matches Calculation:
- The program calculates the total number of matches using `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
- This is also correct because each match contributes 2 points, so dividing the total points by 2 gives the total number of matches.

#### 3. Constraints Check:
- **Constraint `total_matchs > 3`**: This constraint is incorrect. There can indeed be more than 3 matches if the players played multiple games against each other. Therefore, this check should be removed.
- **Constraint `p3 > total_matchs`**: This constraint is correct. The highest score `p3` cannot exceed the total number of matches played.

#### 4. Draws Calculation:
- The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- Let's break down the formula:
  - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points difference between the highest and middle scores, assuming these points came from wins and losses.
  - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points difference between the highest and lowest scores, again assuming these points came from wins and losses.
  - Subtracting these from `total_points` leaves the points that must have come from draws.
- The formula assumes that the points differences can be fully accounted for by wins and losses, which may not always be true, especially when multiple games are played between the same pairs of players.

#### 5. Final Validation:
- The program checks if `egalites < 0`. If so, it returns `-1` because the calculated number of draws is invalid.
- Otherwise, it returns `egalites // 2` as the number of draws.

### Issues Identified:
- The constraint `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect and should be removed.
- The formula for calculating `egalites` does not correctly handle all scenarios, especially when multiple games are played between the same pairs of players.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect constraint and the flawed formula for calculating draws, the program is not entirely correct.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case (0, 0, 0)**:
   - Total points: 0
   - Total matches: 0
   - Draws: 0 (correct)

2. **Test Case (0, 1, 1)**:
   - Total points: 2
   - Total matches: 1
   - Draws: 1 (correct)

3. **Test Case (1, 1, 1)**:
   - Total points: 3 (odd, should return -1)
   - Program returns -1 (correct)

4. **Test Case (1, 1, 2)**:
   - Total points: 4
   - Total matches: 2
   - Draws: 2 (correct)

5. **Test Case (3, 3, 3)**:
   - Total points: 9 (odd, should return -1)
   - Program returns -1 (correct)

6. **Test Case (3, 4, 5)**:
   - Total points: 12
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 6 (correct)

7. **Test Case (1, 1, 10)**:
   - Total points: 12
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 2 (correct)

### Conclusion:
Despite the program handling some test cases correctly, the formula for calculating draws is flawed, and the constraint `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
