Output State: **After all iterations, `t` iterations of the loop have been executed. For each iteration, `cnt_b` is reset to 0 for all elements in `b_values`. The variable `ans` holds the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` across all iterations. The variable `curr` reflects the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b` for the last processed window of size `m`.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have completed:
- The loop has run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the count of elements in `b` (`cnt_b`) is reset to zero after processing.
- `ans` keeps track of how many times the condition `curr >= k` was met across all test cases.
- `curr` reflects the final count of matching elements in the last sliding window of size `m` for the current test case.
