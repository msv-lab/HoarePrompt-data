Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + n // 4`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n // 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
