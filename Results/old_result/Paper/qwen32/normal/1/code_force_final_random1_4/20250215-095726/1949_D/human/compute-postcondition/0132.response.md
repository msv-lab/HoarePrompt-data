Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the original `nx` plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
