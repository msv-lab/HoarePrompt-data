You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        d1[2] = 1
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        m = int(input())
        for j in range(m):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city positions and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the cumulative distance to the closest city from the midpoint between two specified cities.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities based on the given problem description. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program uses dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store the cumulative cost of traveling from the start to each city and from the end to each city, respectively. However, these dictionaries do not correctly represent the minimum cost to travel between any two cities using the closest city rule.

2. **Logic Error in Cost Calculation**: The logic used to populate `d1` and `d2` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the cost to reach a city is either 1 coin (if moving to the closest city) or the direct distance (if not moving to the closest city). This does not account for the possibility of reaching a city through multiple intermediate closest city moves.

3. **Handling Queries Incorrectly**: When processing each query, the program simply subtracts the cumulative costs stored in `d1` or `d2`. This approach does not correctly handle the scenario where the shortest path between two cities involves moving through multiple intermediate closest cities.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the provided program will likely produce incorrect results for some of these queries because it does not correctly model the movement through closest cities.

A correct approach would involve building a graph where each city is connected to its closest city with an edge weight of 1 and to other cities with their respective distances. Then, for each query, a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's or BFS could be used to find the minimum cost to travel between the specified cities.
