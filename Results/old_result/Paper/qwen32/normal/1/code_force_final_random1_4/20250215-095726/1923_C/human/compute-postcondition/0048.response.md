Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` is `m`, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`. The conditions `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` either hold true or do not hold true, meaning either `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` are satisfied, or `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i` is the case.**
