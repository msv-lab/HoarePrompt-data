### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step against the problem requirements:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints "yes". This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   
   - The second condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` seems incorrect and confusing. This condition appears to be checking something related to the difference between `a` and `b`, but the syntax is not correct and the logic is unclear. Moreover, the intended logic seems to be incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the cases where the difference between `a` and `b` is odd.
   
   - The third condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` simplifies to `(a - b) != 0`, which is true for all pairs except when `a == b`. This condition is supposed to check if the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero and odd, but it incorrectly includes even differences as well. The correct condition should be `abs(a - b) % 2 == 1`.
   
   - The `else` clause prints "no", which covers the remaining cases. However, due to the incorrect conditions above, this clause might not behave as expected.

2. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If both `a` and `b` are even, print "yes".
     - If `a` and `b` are not equal and their difference is odd, print "yes".
     - Otherwise, print "no".

3. **Revised Conditions**:
   - The correct condition for printing "yes" should be:
     ```python
     if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
         print('yes')
     elif abs(a - b) % 2 == 1:
         print('yes')
     else:
         print('no')
     ```

Given the analysis, the current implementation is incorrect due to the flawed conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
