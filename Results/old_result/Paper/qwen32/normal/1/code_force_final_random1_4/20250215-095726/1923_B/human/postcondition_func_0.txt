The function `func_1` determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters by firing bullets at them based on their health and positions, given a limit on the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns `False` if any monster cannot be defeated before reaching a position where its distance from the origin matches the number of steps taken, otherwise, it returns `True`.
