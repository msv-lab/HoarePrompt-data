The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. It is also mentioned that `a[0]` is in `b_values`, which means `a[0]` is a key in the dictionary `cnt_b`.

Therefore, the value of `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a[0]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is decreased by 1.**
