The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Given the initial state, `v` initially contains three elements: `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`. After executing the line `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])`, `v` will have four elements: `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`; `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `ad` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]]`; `bd` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]]`; `v` is a list containing four elements `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
