Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is the integer input by the user, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list containing one additional element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, `j` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list containing three elements where the third element is `alp[rev_array[3:].count(rev_array[3]) - 1]`, `j` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
