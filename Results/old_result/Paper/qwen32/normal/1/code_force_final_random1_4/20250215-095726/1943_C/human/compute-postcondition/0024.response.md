The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it holds the return value of `func_1(d)` from a previous execution. The adjacency list `u2vs`, the list of distances `d`, and the list of previous vertices `previous` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.**
