Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1 and the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1 (but still at least 0).
- `start` is initialized to 1.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements `{0, 1}`.

### Print Statement Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Determining the Value
From the initial state, we know:
- `start` is explicitly given as 1.

Therefore, the expression `start + 1` evaluates to:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

### Final Output
The print statement will output the result of the expression `start + 1`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
