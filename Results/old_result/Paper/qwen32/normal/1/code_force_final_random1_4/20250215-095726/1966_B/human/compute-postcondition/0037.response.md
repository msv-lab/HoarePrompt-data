Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is `n - 2`, `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The value of `impossible` is explicitly set to `False` in the given code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code.
