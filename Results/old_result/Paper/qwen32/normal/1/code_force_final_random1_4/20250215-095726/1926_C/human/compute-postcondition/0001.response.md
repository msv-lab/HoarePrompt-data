To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head.

Given:
- The state right before the `while` loop: `num` is a list of integers where each integer \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), and the length of `num` is between 1 and \( 10^4 \), inclusive.
- `a` is 0.
- The `while` loop condition: `while num != 0:`

The loop will execute as long as the condition `num != 0` is true. However, there's a mismatch between the type of `num` (a list) and the comparison to `0` (an integer). In Python, a non-empty list is considered "truthy" in a boolean context, and an empty list is considered "falsy." Therefore, the loop condition should actually be checking if the list is not empty.

Given this, the correct condition should be `while num:` (which checks if `num` is not empty). But since the original condition is `while num != 0:`, we need to interpret it based on the provided condition.

To make the loop execute at least once, `num` should be a non-empty list. Since `num` is already described as a list of integers with a length between 1 and \( 10^4 \), it is already non-empty according to the problem description. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `num`.

However, since the condition `num != 0` might be misleading, we should ensure that `num` is indeed a non-empty list. Given that the problem specifies `num` has a length between 1 and \( 10^4 \), it is guaranteed to be non-empty.

Therefore, no changes are needed to the state of `num` or `a` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), and the length of `num` is between 1 and \( 10^4 \), inclusive; `a` is 0**
