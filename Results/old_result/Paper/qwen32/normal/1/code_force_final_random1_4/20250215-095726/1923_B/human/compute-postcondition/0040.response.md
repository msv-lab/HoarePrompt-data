Postcondition: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0`, then `pos` is updated to 3 and the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is out of bounds. Otherwise, `pos` remains 2 and no changes are made to `a`. `rest = 8` and `delta = 2` remain unchanged.**
