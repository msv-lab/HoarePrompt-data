The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is the newly input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the latest input; `ntest` must be greater than `itest`; `itest` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
