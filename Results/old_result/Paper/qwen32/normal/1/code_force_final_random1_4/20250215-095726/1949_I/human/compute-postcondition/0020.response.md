The given code snippet only sets the variable `bipartite` to `True`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `i` is 0, `ok` is `False`. Additionally, `visited[0]` is `False`.**
