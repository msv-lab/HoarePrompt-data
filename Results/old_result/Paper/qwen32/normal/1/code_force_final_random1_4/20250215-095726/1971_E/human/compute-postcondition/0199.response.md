To determine the output of the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variable `i`:** Set to 1.
2. **List `bd`:** 
   - Starts with `[0]`.
   - Followed by differences between consecutive elements of list `b` starting from index 1.
     - `bd[i] = b[i] - b[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `b`.
3. **List `v`:**
   - Starts with `[0]`.
   - Followed by ratios of corresponding elements of lists `ad` and `bd` starting from index 1.
     - `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `a`.
4. **Variable `q`:** Greater than 0.
5. **Variable `m`:** Calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
6. **Variable `ql`:** Integer value from user input minus `a[s - 1]`.
7. **Variable `s`:** New insertion point of `ql` in `a` found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
8. **Variable `l`:** Set to 2.
9. **Condition:** If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program remains in the same state as the precondition. Otherwise, it remains in the same state.

### Calculation of `m`:
- `m` is calculated using the formula `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- To find `m`, we need to know the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.

### User Input and `ql`:
- `ql` is derived from user input minus `a[s - 1]`.
- Since the exact user input is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ql`.

### Insertion Point `s`:
- `s` is the position where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without disrupting the order.
- `s` is determined by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
- Without knowing `ql` and the contents of `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`.

### Final Calculation:
Given the above, the value of `m` depends on the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`, none of which are explicitly provided in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `ql` and `s` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer value of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
