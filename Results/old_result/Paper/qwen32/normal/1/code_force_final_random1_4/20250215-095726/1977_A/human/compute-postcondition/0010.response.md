Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
  - `i` is initialized to 0.
  - `n` is the first integer from the input.
  - `m` is the second integer from the input.
  - It is specified that `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('Yes')
  ```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. The statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
