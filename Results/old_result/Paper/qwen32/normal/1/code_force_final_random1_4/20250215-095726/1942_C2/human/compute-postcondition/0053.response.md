Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element of `a` is not equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is the final value after all iterations (if applicable), `tmp` is an empty list, and the condition ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1) is true.**
