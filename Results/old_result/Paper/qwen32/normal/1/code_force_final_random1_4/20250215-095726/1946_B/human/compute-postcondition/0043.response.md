Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State: `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` in `range(0, n+1)`

Code Snippet:
```python
sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
```

This line of code modifies the value of `sm`. Let's simplify the expression:

\[ \text{new\_sm} = 2^k \cdot \text{sm} - \text{sm} \]
\[ \text{new\_sm} = (2^k - 1) \cdot \text{sm} \]

So, the new value of `sm` is `(2^k - 1) * sm`.

Since the list `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` does not affect the calculation of `sm` and there is no indication that `k` changes, we only need to update the value of `sm`.

Output State: **`[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`, `sm` is `(2^k - 1) * sm`**

In natural language: The list remains unchanged as `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`, and the value of `sm` is updated to `(2^k - 1) * sm`.
