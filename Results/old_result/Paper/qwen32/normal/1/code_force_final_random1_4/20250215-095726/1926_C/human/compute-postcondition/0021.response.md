To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`.

Given:
- `t`: Remains the same as the input integer.
- `N`: Remains 200001.
- `pd`: A list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 4 to `t` contains the sum of the digits of `i`. All other elements remain 0.
- `i`: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `t + 1`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, N):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `t + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but since the loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `N-1`, `i` should be set to the value it had at the start of the previous iteration, which is `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` should be `t`.
- `N` remains 200001.

State: **`t`: Remains the same as the input integer, `N`: 200001, `i`: `t`**
