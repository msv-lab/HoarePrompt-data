To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop's header: `i` and `n`.

Here's the given information:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`).
- `score` was updated by adding the value at the current index `i` from the list `l` (`score = score + l[i]`).

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be set to its next value in the sequence defined by the loop.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` does not change within the loop; it remains constant throughout all iterations.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

Given these points, let's derive the state at the start of the next iteration:

- Since `i` was incremented by 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be set to the next value in the sequence, which is `i + 2`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Thus, if `i` was `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 4` (since `i` was `i + 2` previously, and now it gets incremented by another 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 4`, `score` is `score + l[i]`**

However, since `score` is updated within the loop body and we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), the correct state considering only the loop head variables is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 4`**
