Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Regardless of the condition, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[m + 2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `cnt_b[a[2m + 2]]` is decreased by 1.**
