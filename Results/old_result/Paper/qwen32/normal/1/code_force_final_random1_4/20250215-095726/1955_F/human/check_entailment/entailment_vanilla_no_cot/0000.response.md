To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.

- XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
- For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
  - `1` in binary is `001`
  - `2` in binary is `010`
  - `3` in binary is `011`
  - `4` in binary is `100`

The key observation is:
- If there are an odd number of `1`s, `2`s, and `3`s initially, then removing one of each will make their counts even, leading to a situation where the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
- If there are an even number of `1`s, `2`s, and `3`s, then removing pairs of these numbers will keep their counts even, and the XOR will remain zero.
- The presence of `4`s does not affect the XOR of `1`, `2`, and `3` directly, but they do contribute to the total count of numbers.

### Program Analysis:

Let's break down the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line attempts to adjust the counts of `1`, `2`, and `3` to be even, but it incorrectly modifies the counts. It subtracts the remainder when divided by 2 from each count, which doesn't achieve the intended effect of making the counts even.
- `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`: This line checks if all three counts (`1`, `2`, `3`) are odd and adds half the total count of numbers to the result. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the optimal removal strategy.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. It incorrectly adjusts the counts and uses flawed logic to calculate the result.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
