The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute as many times as the integer provided by the input function.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs adjustment is the loop counter itself, which is implicitly managed by the `for` loop construct in Python. Since `_` is not actually used within the loop body, its value does not matter, but conceptually, it would have been incremented by 1 after the previous iteration.

However, since the loop's continuation depends on the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, and this value is not part of the provided state, we cannot directly adjust it. But we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations specified by the input must still be greater than the number of completed iterations.

Since the problem specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and there is only the `_` variable (which we don't need to adjust explicitly), the state remains essentially the same except for the implicit iteration count.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `x` is the count of occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**. 

Note: The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached.
