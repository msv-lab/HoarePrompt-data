Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- It is stated that `n` is equal to `m`.

However, the print statement is simply `print('Yes')`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Yes**
