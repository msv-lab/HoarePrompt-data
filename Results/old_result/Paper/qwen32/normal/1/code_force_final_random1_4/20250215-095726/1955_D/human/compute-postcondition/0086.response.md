The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b` contains the final counts of elements in `b` after all iterations, with `cnt_b[i]` reset to 0 for every `i` in `b_values`; `curr` is the number of elements in `a` (from index `n - m` to `n - 1`) that are also in `b` and have a positive count in `cnt_b`; `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
