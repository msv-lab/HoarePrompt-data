To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the code given the constraints and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the following steps occur:
  - Read `n`, the length of the two strings.
  - Read the two strings `a` and `b`.
  - Iterate through the indices from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2 (i.e., odd indices).
  - Check if the current character in `a` and the next character in `b` are both `<` or the current character in `a` and the previous character in `b` are both `<`. If either condition is true, print "No" and break out of the inner loop.
  - If the inner loop completes without breaking, print "Yes".

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: The loop printed "Yes".
- After 2 iterations: The loop printed "Yes" again, indicating the second test case also satisfied the conditions for printing "Yes".
- After 3 iterations: The loop printed "Yes" again, indicating the third test case also satisfied the conditions for printing "Yes".

### Conclusion:
Since the loop printed "Yes" for the first three iterations, it means that for these three test cases, none of the conditions inside the inner loop were met to print "No". Therefore, we can infer that for all `t` test cases, the same conditions were met, leading to the loop printing "Yes" for each test case.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have printed "Yes" for each of the `t` test cases.

**Output State: All test cases result in "Yes" being printed.**

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:
Output State: **All test cases result in "Yes" being printed.**
