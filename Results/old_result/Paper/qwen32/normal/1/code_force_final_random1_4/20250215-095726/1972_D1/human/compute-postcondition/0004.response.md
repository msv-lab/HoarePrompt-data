The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. The loop's execution depends on the return value of `func_10()`. At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

Since the loop uses `range(func_10())`, the loop will iterate as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. After each iteration, the range counter (which is represented by the underscore `_`) is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than the current iteration count.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, the value returned by `func_10()` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again (since the first iteration would have consumed one of those iterations).

State: **The value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character is written to the standard output; `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1**.
