The code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. This affects only the list `c` by adding `j` as its new last element. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `j`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `x_next_next`; `i` is `i + x_next_next`; `j` is unchanged; `p` contains the new element `i + x_next_next`; `c` now includes `j` as its last element.**
