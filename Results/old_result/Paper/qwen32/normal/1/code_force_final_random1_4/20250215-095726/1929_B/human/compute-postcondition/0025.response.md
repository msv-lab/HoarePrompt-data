Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the next line from the input file (after the current `s`).
- `n` is the first integer from the split string of the new `s`.
- `k` is the second integer from the split string of the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `n` is derived from the first integer of the split string `s`.
- The code snippet multiplies `n` by 2 and prints the result.

### Output Description:
- Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical output.
- However, based on the given information, the output will be twice the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 * n (where n is the first integer from the split string s)**
