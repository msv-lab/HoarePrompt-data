To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `j`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 4.
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 5.

The values of `nx`, `i`, and `n` do not change based on the loop head; they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 5**.
