You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd, and if so, increments a counter. Then, it adds half the value of each count (rounded down) to the counter. This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

### Key Observations:

1. **XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the XOR of the entire sequence is zero, Bob wins.
   - If the XOR of the entire sequence is non-zero, Alice wins.

3. **Effect of Removing Numbers:**
   - Removing an even number of identical numbers does not change the parity (odd/even count) of those numbers.
   - Removing an odd number of identical numbers flips the parity.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should aim to create sequences where the XOR is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve should try to balance the counts of numbers in a way that the XOR becomes zero.

### Solution Analysis:

The provided solution calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the counts of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) and applying some logic.

#### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - For each test case, read the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s into a list `a`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, increment the counter `cnt` by 1. This special case likely accounts for scenarios where the initial sequence can be split into pairs plus one leftover of each type, leading to a zero XOR.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For each count in the list `a`, add the floor division of the count by 2 to `cnt`. This part of the code seems to account for the fact that removing pairs of numbers does not affect the XOR result, and thus each pair can contribute to a potential win for Bob.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the value of `cnt` for each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation:

While the provided solution seems to address the problem, it lacks a rigorous mathematical proof or detailed explanation for why the specific logic works in all cases. However, based on the examples provided and the general understanding of the problem, the solution appears to correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis and the matching output for the provided examples, the solution seems to be correct.
