In the given initial state, we have several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) described with specific conditions and relationships. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

Despite the presence of these variables, they do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
