Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`. If `a[m + 2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `cnt_b[a[2m + 2]]` is decreased by 1. Regardless of whether `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` or not, `curr` is increased by 1.**
