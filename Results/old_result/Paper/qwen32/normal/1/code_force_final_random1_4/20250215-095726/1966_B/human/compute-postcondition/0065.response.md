The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so if it was `k` before incrementing, it is now `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than `m - 1`, meaning `k` must be less than `m - 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it is `j - 1` before the increment. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j` (which is `k + 1`).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `j` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1.**
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.**

To clarify, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.**

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.**

To make it clear:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` remains unchanged, `j` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**

So, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.**
