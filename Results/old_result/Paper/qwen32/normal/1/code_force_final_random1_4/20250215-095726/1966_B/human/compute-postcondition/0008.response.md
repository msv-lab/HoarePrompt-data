The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` must remain greater than 0, and since we don't have a specific upper limit for `n` other than it being greater than 0, we can keep the condition as `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the first being the original user input and the second being the new user input), `i` is 2**
