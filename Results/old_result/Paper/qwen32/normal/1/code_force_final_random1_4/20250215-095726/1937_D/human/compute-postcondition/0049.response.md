To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `j`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>';
- `n` is greater than 0;
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`;
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`;
- `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty;
- `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<';
- `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`;
- `j` is `j + 1`.

Since only `j` is part of the loop head, we only need to adjust `j`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_prev`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_prev + 1`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `j_prev`, we can express the new state in terms of `j` directly:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

But to make it clear and precise for the next iteration, we should write:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Since we need to adjust `j` specifically, let's rewrite it clearly:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

To make it explicit for the next iteration:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - ((j + 1) + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`**

Simplifying the expression for `i`:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 2 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`**

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 2 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`**
