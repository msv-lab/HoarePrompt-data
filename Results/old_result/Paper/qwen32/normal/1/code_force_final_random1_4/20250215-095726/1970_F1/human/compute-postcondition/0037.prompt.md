Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid with `elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of two empty lists; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid. If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', `elements` includes `line[ind]: (i, ind)`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, otherwise `allPlayers` remains empty. `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of the current element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G'. `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`. `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including `line[1]: (0, 1)` if `line[1]` is not equal to '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[1]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[1])` is True and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', otherwise `allPlayers` remains empty; `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(0, 1)` if the second character of `line[1]` is 'G' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..'; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element; `ind` is 1; `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', otherwise `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including `line[1]: (0, 1)` if `line[1]` is not equal to '..', and if `line[ind]` is not equal to '..', it also includes `line[2]: (0, 2)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[1]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[1])` is True and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', and `allPlayers[line[2]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True and `line[ind]` is not equal to '..'; `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(0, 1)` if the second character of `line[1]` is 'G' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` includes `(0, 2)` in the same sublist as `(0, 1)` depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element; `ind` is 2; `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
