### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array. However, the logic implemented in the code does not fully capture the requirements of the problem.

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to reduce all elements of the array to zero using the specified operation. The operation allows us to decrease three consecutive elements in the array by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. This means that the parity (odd or even nature) of the elements plays a crucial role, but the condition checked in the code is insufficient to guarantee correctness.

Here are some key points to consider:
1. **Parity Check**: The operation always changes the parity of the middle element and leaves the parities of the first and last elements unchanged. Therefore, for the entire array to be reduced to zeros, the first and last elements must be even because they cannot be changed by the operation.
2. **Specific Condition**: The code checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros. There could be other configurations of the array that prevent it from being reduced to zeros even if this condition is not met.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
