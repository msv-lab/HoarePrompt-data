To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the integer value of the user input
- `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `word` is initially an empty string ''
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the code snippet, it's mentioned in the initial state)

The code snippet is:
```python
word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
```

Let's break down the changes:
- `word` is updated by appending the string `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

Since `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `alphabet[n - 28]` refers to the character at index `n - 28`. Given that `n` is the integer value of the user input, we need to ensure `n - 28` is within the bounds of the string `alphabet` (i.e., between 0 and 25).

For example:
- If `n` is 29, `alphabet[n - 28]` is `alphabet[1]` which is 'b'.
- If `n` is 30, `alphabet[n - 28]` is `alphabet[2]` which is 'c'.
- And so on...

Thus, the new value of `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state but not used in the code snippet, its value does not affect the output state. Therefore, we only need to consider the changes to `word`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
