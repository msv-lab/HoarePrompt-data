You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: All test cases result in "Yes" being printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>'. It checks if it's possible to pair each '<' in the first string with a '>' in the second string such that each pair is aligned vertically and no two pairs overlap. For each test case, it outputs "YES" if such pairing is possible, otherwise "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The robot makes two moves per second: first, it moves freely (left, right, up, or down), and then it moves according to the arrow in the cell it lands in. The goal is to determine if there exists a sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach the target cell (2, n).

### Key Observations:
- The robot must eventually move from row 1 to row 2.
- Once the robot reaches row 2, it must continue moving right until it reaches column n.
- To move from row 1 to row 2, the robot must land on a cell in row 1 with an arrow pointing down (which would not exist here since arrows only point left or right). Instead, the robot must use a specific sequence of moves to switch rows.
- The critical observation is that to switch rows, the robot must land on a cell in row 1 with an arrow pointing right and then move down to row 2, or land on a cell in row 2 with an arrow pointing left and then move up to row 1.

### Program Analysis:
The program checks for certain conditions in the grid to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. Specifically, it iterates through the columns (considering only odd indices) and checks if there are consecutive '<' arrows that could trap the robot in row 1 or row 2.

However, this approach does not fully capture all scenarios required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. Here are some issues with the program:
- The program only checks for specific patterns of '<' arrows but does not account for the necessary conditions to switch rows.
- It does not consider the possibility of using '>' arrows to move between rows.
- The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid to verify if it can reach the target cell.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). It fails to account for the necessary conditions to switch rows and simulate the robot's movement accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
