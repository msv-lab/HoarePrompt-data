The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the other variables `t`, `x`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `1000 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`.**
