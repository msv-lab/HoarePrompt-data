You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import sqrt

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: the value of `ans` after the last test case has been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest divisor `i` of `x` such that `(x - n * i)` is also divisible by `i` and non-negative.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

### Key Observations:
1. **Divisibility Check**: For a number `i` to be a potential candidate for the GCD, `x` must be divisible by `i` (`x % i == 0`). This is because all difficulties must be multiples of `i`.
2. **Sum Constraint**: If `i` is a candidate, the total difficulty `x` should be able to be partitioned into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `i`. This means `(x - n * i)` must be non-negative and divisible by `i`.
3. **Iterate Over Possible Divisors**: We iterate over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to check these conditions efficiently.
4. **Check Both `i` and `x/i`**: For each divisor `i`, we also check `x/i` as a potential candidate because both `i` and `x/i` could be valid divisors.

### Program Logic:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
- It initializes `ans` to 1 (since the minimum GCD is 1).
- It iterates over all possible divisors `i` from 1 to `sqrt(x)`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` and if the remaining difficulty after subtracting `n * i` is divisible by `i`.
- It also checks the same conditions for `x/i`.
- It updates `ans` with the maximum valid divisor found.
- Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies all possible divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`.
- It checks both `i` and `x/i` as potential candidates for the GCD.
- It ensures that the remaining difficulty after partitioning is divisible by the candidate GCD.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
