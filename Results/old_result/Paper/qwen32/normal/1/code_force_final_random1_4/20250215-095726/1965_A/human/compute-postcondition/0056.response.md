Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `test` is `False`. The current value of `j` satisfies the condition that `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. If `j` is odd, then `j` remains odd; otherwise, `j` remains even. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`, and `j` remain unchanged except that we exit the current loop or if statement.
