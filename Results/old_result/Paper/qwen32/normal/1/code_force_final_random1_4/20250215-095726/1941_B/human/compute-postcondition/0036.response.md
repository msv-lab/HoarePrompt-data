Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first `n-2` elements are `0` and the last two elements are decremented by the respective `opNum` values. If `stop` is True, then `stop` remains True. If `stop` is False, then `stop` remains False.**
