Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the given string `s` and printing their sum as the result. However, this approach is incorrect because simply counting the occurrences of these substrings does not give the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. 

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input string: "mappie"
- The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions.
- However, only 1 deletion is actually needed to make the string beautiful, for instance, by removing the last 'e', resulting in the string "mappi", which does not contain either "map" or "pie".

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to find a way to identify and remove the minimum number of characters that cover all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". This could involve more complex algorithms such as dynamic programming or interval merging, which are not implemented in the provided code.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
