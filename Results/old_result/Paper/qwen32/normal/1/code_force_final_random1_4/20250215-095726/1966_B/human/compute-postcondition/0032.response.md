Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is `'NO'`, and the first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). Additionally, if the first element of the `i`-th sublist in `gr` (`gr[i][0]`) is not equal to the first element of the `(i+1)`-th sublist in `gr` (`gr[i + 1][0]`), or the last element of the `i`-th sublist in `gr` (`gr[i][m - 1]`) is not equal to the last element of the `(i+1)`-th sublist in `gr` (`gr[i + 1][m - 1]`), then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
