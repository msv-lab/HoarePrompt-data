To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is set to 1.
- `bd` is constructed as `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`. This means `bd` starts with a 0, followed by the differences between consecutive elements of list `b`.
- `v` is constructed as `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`. This means `v` starts with a 0, followed by the division of corresponding elements from lists `ad` and `bd`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated as `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the insertion point of the original `ql` in `a`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
- `l` is set to 2 if `a[s]` equals `ql`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

### Calculation of `m`:
The value of `m` is determined by the formula:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \cdot ql}{ad[s]} \]

Given the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `b`, `ad`, `a`, `ql`, and `s`. However, we know the structure of how `m` is computed.

### Printing Statement:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer part of `m` followed by a space.

### Explanation:
Since the exact values of `b`, `ad`, `a`, `ql`, and `s` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe the output based on the formula and the given information.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer part of `m`, where `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
