Given the initial state and the code snippet, the program simply returns the value of `l`. Since `l` is defined as the result of `func_3(c, l)`, we need to acknowledge that `l` is whatever value `func_3(c, l)` produces, but since the function `func_3` is not defined in the given context, we can only state that `l` is the output of this function call.

Thus, the output state will be described as follows:

Output State: **The program returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2.**
