Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[1]`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`.**
