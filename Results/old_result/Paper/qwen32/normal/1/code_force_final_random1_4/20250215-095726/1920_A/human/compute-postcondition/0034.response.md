The code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, and `start`) remain unchanged unless `start` was previously updated based on the condition `if t == 1 and start < v`.

Since the code only affects `end`, the new state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `i` is incremented by 1; `t` and `v` are integers obtained from the input; if `t` equals 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is updated to the value of `v`; `end` is equal to `v`.**
