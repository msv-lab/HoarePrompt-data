To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal, and at no point in the sequence does the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening ones.
2. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**: 
   - Compute the balance of each prefix of the sequence.
   - Sort these balances in ascending order, breaking ties by position in descending order.
   - Form a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function seems to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position, but it's not used in the main function `func_2`.
- `func_2`: This function performs the balanced shuffle operation as described.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character's balance and position, and a variable `balance` to keep track of the current balance.
2. **Building Balance Information**:
   - It iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
   - It updates the balance: increments it for '(', and decrements it for ')'.
3. **Sorting**:
   - It sorts the `balance_info` list using a lambda function as the key. The lambda function sorts primarily by balance in ascending order and secondarily by position in descending order (achieved by negating the position).
4. **Forming the Result**:
   - It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

### Verification:
- The sorting criteria ensure that the sequence formed is indeed a balanced shuffle according to the problem statement.
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
