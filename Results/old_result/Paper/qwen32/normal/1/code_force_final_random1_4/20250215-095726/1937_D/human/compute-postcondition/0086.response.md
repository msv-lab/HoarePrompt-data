The given code snippet only increments the value of `l` by 1. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, `a`, `x`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is `l + 1`; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'. If `l < r`, then `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r`, then `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`; otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
