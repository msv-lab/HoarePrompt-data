The code snippet assigns the value `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `impossible`, and the previous value of `ans` (which was also `'NO'`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `ans` is `'NO'`, and `impossible` is `True`.**
