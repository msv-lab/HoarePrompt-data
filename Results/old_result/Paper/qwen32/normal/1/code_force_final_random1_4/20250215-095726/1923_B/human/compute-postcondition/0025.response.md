Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`; `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters; `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second such that `k > 2 * delta`; `n` is the length of the list `a` and is greater than 0; `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`; `distance` is 0; `pos` is either 0, 1, or 2; `rest` is `k - 3 * delta`; `delta` is `min(k - 2 * delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in the list `a` has been decreased by `delta`. All other variables retain their initial values.
