Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The variables `zero` and `one` are initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
