The `break` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables; it simply exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block shown in the context, the `break` statement would have no effect on the program flow or variable states.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with the addition of the note that the `break` statement was encountered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `tmp` is `'a'`, `i` is 0, and `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true, and the `break` statement was encountered.**
