Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is greater than or equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1]`**
