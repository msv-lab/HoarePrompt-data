The code snippet `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the count of the element at index `start` in the `Counter` object `nums` by 1. Given the initial state, `start` is 1, so the count of the element at index 1 in `nums` is decreased by 1.

Since `nums` is a `Counter` object and the count of the element at index 1 was initially set to at least 1, after decrementing, the count of the element at index 1 will be at least 0.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1 and the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1 (but still at least 0). `start` is 1. `vis` is `{0, 1}`.**
