Postcondition: **The list `suf` has at least `i+1` elements, and the list `smin` has at least `i+1` elements. The list initially contains `n+1` zeros. The variable `sm` is either -111 or a value such that `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm`. The variable `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if the condition `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` holds true.**
