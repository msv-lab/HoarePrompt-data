To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables over its entire run from `i = 0` to `i = n-2`.

### Key Variables and Their Modifications:
1. **`zero` and `one`**: These counters keep track of the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far as the loop progresses.
2. **`zero_perc` and `one_perc`**: These percentages represent the proportion of '0's and '1's seen up to the current index and the remaining part of the string, respectively.
3. **`lst`**: This list stores indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-2`.
- For each iteration:
  - If `s[i]` is '0', increment `zero`.
  - If `s[i]` is '1', increment `one`.
  - Calculate `zero_perc` and `one_perc` based on the current counts and positions.
  - If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, append `i + 1` to `lst`.

### Final State:
After the loop completes all iterations (`i` goes from `0` to `n-2`), the following will be true:
- `zero` will be the total number of '0's in the string `s`.
- `one` will be the total number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `lst` will contain all indices where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop.

### Output State:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop can be described as follows:

- `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, and `mini` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`.
- `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`.
- `lst` contains all indices where the percentage of '0's seen so far and the percentage of '1's remaining are both at least 50%.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is 100000000.**
