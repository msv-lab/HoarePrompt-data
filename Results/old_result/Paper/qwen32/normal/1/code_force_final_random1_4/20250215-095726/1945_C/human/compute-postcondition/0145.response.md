Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; if `len(final)` is 0, then `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`; if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to `[0]`; otherwise, `final` is set to a list containing `n`; if `len(final)` is not 0, `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`; `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `pk` is now set to `n / 2`. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
