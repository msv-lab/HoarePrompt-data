You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>'. It checks if it's possible to pair each '<' in the first string with a '>' in the second string such that each pair is aligned vertically and no two pairs overlap. For each test case, it outputs "YES" if such pairing is possible, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used in the program is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all possible configurations of arrows in the grid.

Here's a detailed analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program only checks certain conditions involving pairs of cells in the grid but does not simulate the robot's movements step-by-step according to the rules provided. It specifically checks for certain patterns of '<' arrows but does not account for all possible valid paths the robot could take.

2. **Missing Path Simulation**: The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and then follow the arrow in the cell it lands in. The program does not simulate this movement process, which is crucial for determining if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle various edge cases, such as when the robot needs to move up or down multiple times to reach the target cell, or when the robot can reach the target cell through a series of complex movements that the current logic does not account for.

Let's consider a specific counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
6
><><><
><><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The robot can follow the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6), reaching the target cell (2, 6).

However, the provided program would likely output "NO" for this input because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movements and instead relies on a flawed condition check.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is False.
