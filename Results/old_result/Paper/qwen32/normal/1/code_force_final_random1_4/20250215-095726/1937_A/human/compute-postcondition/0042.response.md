The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer provided by the user. This means that the value of `n` changes based on the user's input, while the other variables remain unchanged unless further instructions modify them.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the integer provided by the user (initially, before the code snippet)

After executing the code snippet, `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n_cases` is equal to `t`; `i` is 2; `n` is the integer provided by the user.**
