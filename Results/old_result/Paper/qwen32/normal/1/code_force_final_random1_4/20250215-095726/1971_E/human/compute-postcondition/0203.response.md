Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `q`. It also receives two lists `a` and `b` of length `k`, and `q` queries `d`. The function processes these inputs to determine a result for each query `d` based on the provided constraints and relationships.**
