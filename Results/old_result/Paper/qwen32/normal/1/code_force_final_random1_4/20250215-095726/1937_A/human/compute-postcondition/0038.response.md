Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user.
- `power` is equal to `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: This is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user. Let's denote this integer as `x`. Therefore, `n = log2(x)`.
2. **Variable `power`**: This is defined as `n - 1`. Substituting the value of `n`, we get `power = log2(x) - 1`.
3. **Expression `2 ** power`**: We need to evaluate `2 ** (log2(x) - 1)`.

Using properties of logarithms and exponents:
\[ 2^{(\log_2(x) - 1)} = 2^{\log_2(x)} \cdot 2^{-1} = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \]

So, the expression `2 ** power` simplifies to `x / 2`, where `x` is the integer provided by the user.

### Output:
The code will print half of the integer provided by the user.

Output: **x / 2 (where x is the integer provided by the user)**
