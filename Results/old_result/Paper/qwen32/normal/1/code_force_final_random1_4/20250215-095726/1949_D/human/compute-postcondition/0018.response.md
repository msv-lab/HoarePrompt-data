The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value stored at index `j` in the array `a` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value at `a[2]` will be incremented by 1.

Since the initial state mentions that `a[1]` is incremented by 1, we infer that `a` is an array (likely a list) with at least 3 elements (indices 0, 1, and 2). However, the initial value of `a[2]` is not specified, so we denote its new value simply as `a[2]` being incremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, `j` is 2, `a[1]` has been incremented by 1, `a[2]` has been incremented by 1.**
