Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is `k - 1`; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
