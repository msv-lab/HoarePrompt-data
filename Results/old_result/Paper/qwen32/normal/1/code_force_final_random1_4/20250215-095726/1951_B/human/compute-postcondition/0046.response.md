Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: a list with two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively, and a list of `n` integers representing the unique Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Based on these inputs, the function returns different values depending on the conditions specified in the test cases. Specifically, the function may return 13, `k - 1`, a value from a list `ind` minus 1, the result of comparisons and calculations involving elements of `ind` and `k`, or the maximum of certain differences involving `ind` and `k`.**
