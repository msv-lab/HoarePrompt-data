The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over `y` starting from `max_p - 1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` was `1`. Since the loop decrements `y` by `1` each iteration, the loop will terminate if `y` becomes `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` should be initialized to a value greater than `1`.

Given that `max_p` is `2`, the loop should start with `y` equal to `max_p - 1`, which is `1`. However, since we are looking for the state at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `2` (the initial value before it gets decremented to `1`).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `y` set to `2`.

State: **`custo` is 175 if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` (which evaluates to `20 + 25 <= 20` being false, thus making `custo` 160). `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains 5, `max_p` remains 2, `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`, and `y` is 2**
