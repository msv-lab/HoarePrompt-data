The code snippet initializes an empty list `sa`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `xx`.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is an empty list.**
