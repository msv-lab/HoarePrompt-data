Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `new` is a list of integers where `new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` otherwise; `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` otherwise; `i` is the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]`. At this point, `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, indicating that there is at least one index where the elements of `a` and `b` differ.**
