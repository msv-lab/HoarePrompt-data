To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot accurately determine how the variables are affected. However, based on the given format and instructions, we'll assume that `func_1()` does not modify the variable `t` or introduce any new variables unless specified.

Given that `func_1()` is called and no other details about its functionality are provided, we will assume that `t` remains unchanged and no other variables are introduced or modified.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 0 < `t` <= 10^4.**
