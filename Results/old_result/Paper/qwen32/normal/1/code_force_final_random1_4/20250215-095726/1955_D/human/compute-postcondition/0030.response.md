The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `curr` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of `a[m]` decreased by 1 if `a[m]` is in `b_values`
- `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`
- `ans` is 0
- `curr` is either 1 or 0
- `i` is `m`

After executing `curr += 1`, the value of `curr` will be either 2 (if `curr` was initially 1) or 1 (if `curr` was initially 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of `a[m]` decreased by 1 if `a[m]` is in `b_values`; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is either 1 or 2; `i` is `m`.**
