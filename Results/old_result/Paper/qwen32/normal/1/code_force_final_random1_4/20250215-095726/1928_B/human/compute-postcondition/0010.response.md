The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will now contain three elements: the first two elements are `arr[0] * arr[0]` and the third element is `tem` which is `arr[0] * arr[0] * arr[1]`. The values of `arr`, `tem`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is a list containing three elements, the first two are `arr[0] * arr[0]` and the third is `arr[0] * arr[0] * arr[1]`, `tem` is `arr[0] * arr[0] * arr[1]`, `i` is `1`**.
