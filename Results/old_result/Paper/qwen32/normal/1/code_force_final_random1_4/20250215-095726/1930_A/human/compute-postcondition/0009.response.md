The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given that `i` is `i + 4`, it means that `i` has already been incremented by 4 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the value of `score` will be updated by adding the element at the new index `i` (which is `i + 4` from its previous value) of the list `l`.

Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is greater than 0, and `l` is a sorted list of integers, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `score`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 4`, `score` is updated by adding `l[i]` to its previous value.**
