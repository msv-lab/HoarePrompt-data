Postcondition: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i + m]` is in the set of `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` has been decremented by 1 and is now greater than or equal to 0. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, `curr` has been decreased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in the set of `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` has been incremented by 1.**
