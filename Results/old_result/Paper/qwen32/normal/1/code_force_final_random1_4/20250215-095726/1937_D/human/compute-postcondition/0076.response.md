The code snippet calculates a new value for `a` based on the existing values of `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, and `i`. Specifically, it uses the last element of `B` (which is `B[r - 1]`), adjusts it by adding the product of the difference between the last index of '<' (`idx_B[r - 1]`) and the current index `i`, multiplied by `r`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'.
- `l` is not less than `r`.
- `r` is greater than 0.

After executing the code, the only variable that changes is `a`, which is newly defined. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'; `l` is not less than `r`; `r` is greater than 0.**
