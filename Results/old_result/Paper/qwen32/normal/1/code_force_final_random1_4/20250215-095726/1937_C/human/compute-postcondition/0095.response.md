The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `k` will now also be 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `best`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is 2; `best` is 1; `res` is the value of the user's new input; `i` is 2**.
