The code snippet `b_values = []` reassigns `b_values` to an empty list. This means the previous contents of `b_values` are discarded and it is now an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is 0; `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, including the newly appended value; `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is 0; `max_p` is 0; `a_values` is an empty list; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
