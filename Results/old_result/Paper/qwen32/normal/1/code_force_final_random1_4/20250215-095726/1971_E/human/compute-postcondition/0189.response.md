Output State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point of the original `ql` in `a`. If `a[s]` was equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, the state of these variables remains unchanged, `l` is 2**

In natural language: The value of `m` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
