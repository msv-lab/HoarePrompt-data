### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program aims to determine whether a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`), the program prints 'yes'.
     - **Reasoning:** If both dimensions are even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of equal size, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   
   - **Condition 2:** The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` seems incorrect and does not make logical sense in the context of the problem. It appears to be a mistake or misinterpretation of the logic.
     - **Reasoning:** This condition does not correctly check any meaningful property of the rectangle dimensions. It should be removed or corrected.
   
   - **Condition 3:** The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` simplifies to `True` for any non-zero difference between \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, it will always print 'yes' when \(a \neq b\).
     - **Reasoning:** This condition is too broad and does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not account for the possibility that the difference being odd might not allow forming a new rectangle.
   
   - **Else Case:** If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'no'.
     - **Reasoning:** This would cover the case where \(a = b\), but due to the incorrect conditions, this part of the logic is not reliable.

### Issues Identified:
- The second condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and does not serve any purpose.
- The third condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is overly broad and incorrect for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
- The logic needs to be simplified and corrected to accurately reflect the problem requirements.

### Correct Logic:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, print 'yes'.
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are not both even, check if the product \(a \times b\) can be split into two parts that can form a new rectangle. This happens if at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
- If neither dimension is even, print 'no'.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided code, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
