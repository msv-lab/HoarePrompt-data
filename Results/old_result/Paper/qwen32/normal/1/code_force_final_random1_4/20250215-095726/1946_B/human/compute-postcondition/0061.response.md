To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.
- `suf` has a new element appended which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.

In the loop:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value such that the loop condition was satisfied. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`, `n` does not change at the start of each iteration unless specified otherwise in the loop body (which is omitted here).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains the same, and it must still be greater than `i_prev + 1` for the loop to continue.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `suf` has a new element appended which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

But to match the format requested:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), the final state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**. 

To be more specific and assuming `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration, the state would be:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

So, the most accurate representation adhering to the given format is:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**. 

Or more specifically:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
