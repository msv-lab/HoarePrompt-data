#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not take any parameters and returns an integer, likely representing user input for the number of test cases or other integer values required by the main logic of the program.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user for input and returns the input converted to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`. This function does not have any parameters and thus no preconditions can be derived from its signature alone.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the int function to each element of the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3()`. This function is expected to read input from standard input, split it into a list of strings, convert each string to an integer, and return the resulting list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were obtained by converting each string in the input, which was split into a list of strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into individual components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_4` does not take any parameters.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers derived from the space-separated string input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` prompts the user to input a space-separated string of integers, converts this string into a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_5`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the provided function signature alone.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element of the list obtained by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes no input parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to a string (though they are already strings), and returns a map object containing these strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no input parameters and returns a list of characters from the string provided by the user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the input, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into words, converts each word to a string, sorts these strings alphabetically, and returns the sorted list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]

    #State: `ans` is a list of cumulative products of `arr`, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of cumulative products of `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements up to that point in the original list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []

    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):

    #State: `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the end of the input list up to the current position.
