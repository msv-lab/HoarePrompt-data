The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is `a[i]` (which was the original value before the operation), and `a[i]` is now 0, `2 * opNum` is also 0. Therefore, the value of `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now being 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `stop` is True if the current element `a[i]` (which was originally less than 0) is less than 0; otherwise, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is `a[i]` (which was the original value before the operation).**
