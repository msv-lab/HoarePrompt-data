The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given that the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of `b_values`, the count associated with `a[i]` in `cnt_b` will increase by 1.

Output State: **`t` and `curr` are integers, `n` must be greater than `m`, the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
