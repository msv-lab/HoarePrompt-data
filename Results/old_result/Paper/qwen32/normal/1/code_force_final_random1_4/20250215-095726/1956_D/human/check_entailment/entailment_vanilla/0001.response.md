Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be designed to handle the case where `l == r`, setting `a[l]` to 0 if it's not already 0 and recording the operation.
   - For the general case (`l < r`), it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if `a[l]` needs to be updated to `r - l + 1`. If it does, it performs the operation and updates the array.
   - However, there is a critical issue here: `func_1` is modifying the global variable `ops` without passing it as a parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which means the operations won't be recorded properly.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if the current sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum condition is not met, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively calling itself on the left and right parts.
   - Similar to `func_1`, this function also modifies the global `ops` list without passing it as a parameter.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.
   - Since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not correctly pass and modify the `ops` list, the operations recorded will be incomplete or incorrect.

### Issues Identified:
- The functions `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` modify a global `ops` list without passing it as a parameter. This leads to incorrect recording of operations.
- The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` for splitting the array around the maximum element and updating the array might not be optimal for maximizing the sum.
- The overall structure of the program does not ensure that the operations are correctly recorded and applied.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect handling of the `ops` list and the potential inefficiency in maximizing the sum, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
