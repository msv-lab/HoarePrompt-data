The given code snippet contains a mistake because `num` is described as a list, and you cannot apply the modulus operation (`%`) directly to a list. However, assuming the intention was to iterate over each element in the list and add the last digit of each element to `a`, I will proceed with that assumption.

Given the Initial State: `num` is a non-empty list of integers with each element's last digit removed, `a` is updated to its original value plus the sum of the last digits of each element in the original `num`.

Let's assume the original `num` list before the last digits were removed was `[num1, num2, ..., numN]`. After removing the last digits, `num` would be something like `[num1//10, num2//10, ..., numN//10]`. The last digits of the original numbers would be `[num1 % 10, num2 % 10, ..., numN % 10]`.

The correct interpretation of the intended code would be something like:
```python
for number in original_num:
    a = a + (number % 10)
```
However, since we don't have the original list, let's denote the sum of the last digits of the original `num` list as `sum_of_last_digits`.

Thus, the new value of `a` would be its original value plus `sum_of_last_digits`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers with each element's last digit removed, `a` is updated to its original value plus the sum of the last digits of each element in the original `num`.**

In simpler terms: The list `num` remains unchanged, and `a` is now the sum of its original value and the sum of the last digits of the original elements in `num`.
