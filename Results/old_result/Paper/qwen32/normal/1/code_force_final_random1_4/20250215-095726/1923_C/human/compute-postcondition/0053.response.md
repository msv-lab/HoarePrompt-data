The given code snippet resets the variable `p` to `[0]`. This means that the previous value of `p`, which was `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the list `l`, is now simply `[0]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `p` is `[0]`, `i` is the sum of all elements in the previous `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in the previous `l`**.
