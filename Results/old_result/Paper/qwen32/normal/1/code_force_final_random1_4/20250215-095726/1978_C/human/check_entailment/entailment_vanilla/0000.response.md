To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic and steps involved in the code.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element of the permutation and its index (starting from 1).

2. **Constraints:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴`
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10⁵`
   - `0 ≤ k ≤ 10¹²`
   - Sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 × 10⁵`.

3. **Approach in the Code:**
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
     - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
     - Checks if `k` is odd; if so, returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
     - Calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`.
     - If `k > max_k`, returns `(0, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, returns `(n, k)` indicating the problem is solvable.

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - Constructs a permutation by iteratively adjusting elements.
     - Uses helper functions `func_2` and `func_3` to swap elements in the permutation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - Swaps two specific elements in the permutation to adjust the Manhattan value.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
     - Swaps two other specific elements in the permutation.

   - **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
     - Prints the permutation if a solution is found.

   - **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
     - Calls `func_4` to check if the problem is solvable.
     - If solvable, calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and prints it.
     - Otherwise, prints "NO".

4. **Key Observations:**
   - The code checks if `k` is even because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - The code calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` which is `(n^2 - 1) / 2` for odd `n` and `n^2 / 2` for even `n`.
   - The code uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation by iteratively adjusting elements.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for constructing the permutation in `func_1` seems complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
   - The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` might not always produce a valid permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the permutation construction logic and the potential issues with the swapping mechanism, it is challenging to verify the correctness of the entire program without extensive testing. However, based on the provided example outputs and the general logic, the program seems to follow a reasonable approach.

However, the provided code does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs within the constraints, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, while the program might work for some test cases, it cannot be definitively stated as correct for all scenarios.

**Correctness: False**
