Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`, and `i` is `i - 1`.**
