The value of `g` is updated to `int(n / count)`. Given the initial state, `count` is 3, so `g` becomes `int(n / 3)`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are still the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 3.
- `count` is still 3.
- `ans` is still `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`.
- `countmins` is still 2.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)`**.
