Let's break down the initial state and the logic leading to the `print(final[0])` statement:

1. **Determine `mini`:**
   - `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
   - This means `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`.

2. **Determine `final`:**
   - If `len(final)` is 0, then:
     - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
     - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to `[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `final` is set to a list containing `n`.
   - If `len(final)` is not 0, `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(final[0])` will print the first element of the `final` list.

Given these steps, let's analyze the possible states of `final`:

- **Case 1: Initially `len(final)` is 0:**
  - Calculate `c1` as `o * 100 // n`.
  - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`.
  - If `c1 < 50`, `final` becomes `[n]`.
  - In both cases, `final` will have at least one element, so `final[0]` will be either `0` or `n`.

- **Case 2: Initially `len(final)` is not 0:**
  - `final` already contains elements `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
  - Since `final` is sorted, `final[0]` will be the smallest element among those that satisfy `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

Based on the above analysis, the output of `print(final[0])` depends on the initial state of `final` and the calculations involving `c1` if `final` was initially empty. Here is the precise description:

- If `final` was initially empty and `c1 >= 50`, `final[0]` will be `0`.
- If `final` was initially empty and `c1 < 50`, `final[0]` will be `n`.
- If `final` was not initially empty, `final[0]` will be the smallest element in `lst` that satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

Since the exact values of `o`, `n`, `pk`, and `lst` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `final[0]` in all cases. However, we can describe it precisely based on the conditions.

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is 0 if c1 >= 50 and final was initially empty, n if c1 < 50 and final was initially empty, or the smallest element in lst that satisfies abs(pk - elem) == mini if final was not initially empty)**
