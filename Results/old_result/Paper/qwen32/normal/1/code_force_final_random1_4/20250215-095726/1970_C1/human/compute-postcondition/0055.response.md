Postcondition: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now added to `visited` and the `queue` includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`. `neighbor` remains the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
