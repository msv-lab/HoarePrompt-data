Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the newly input string; `j` is `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `i+1`; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains the same; `flag` is True indicating there is at least one '01' transition in `s`.**
