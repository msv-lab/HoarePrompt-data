The code snippet appends the value `0` to the list `A`. This means that the list `A` now contains an additional element which is `0`. The values of the variables `s`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `A` contains an additional element `0`.**
