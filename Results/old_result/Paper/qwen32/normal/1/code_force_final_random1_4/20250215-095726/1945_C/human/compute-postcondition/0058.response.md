To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for elem in lst:`. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust is `elem`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4;
- `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5;
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1';
- `s` is the input string;
- `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd;
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`;
- `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`;
- `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`;
- `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`;
- `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`;
- `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `lst` must have at least one element;
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`;
- `final` is a list that includes `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` for some `elem` in `lst`;
- `elem` is `next_elem` where `next_elem` is the next element in `lst` to be processed.

Since `elem` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in `lst` after the current `elem`. 

Let's denote the current value of `elem` as `current_elem`. The next value of `elem` would be the next element in `lst` after `current_elem`. If `lst` is indexed starting from 0, and assuming `current_elem` is at index `k`, then the next `elem` would be at index `k+1`.

However, since we don't have the exact position of `current_elem` in `lst`, we can simply say that `elem` will be the next element in `lst` after its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `lst` must have at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list that includes `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` for some `elem` in `lst`; `elem` is the next element in `lst` after the current `elem`.**
