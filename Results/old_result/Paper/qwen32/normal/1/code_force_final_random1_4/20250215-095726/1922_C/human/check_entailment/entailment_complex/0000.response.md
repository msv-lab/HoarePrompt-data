### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by precomputing distances using two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, which store cumulative distances from each city to the next closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of Distances**:
   - The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are initialized incorrectly. Specifically, `d1[2]` and `d2[n-1]` are set to 1, which doesn't align with the problem's requirements.
   - The loops that populate `d1` and `d2` do not correctly compute the minimum cost to reach the closest city. Instead, they seem to be adding distances unnecessarily.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The program assumes that the difference in values between `d1` and `d2` will give the correct result for the minimum cost between two cities. This is not accurate because `d1` and `d2` are not computed to reflect the correct minimal path costs.

3. **Logic for Closest City**:
   - The problem specifies that for each city, the closest city is unique. However, the provided code does not correctly identify the closest city and instead seems to be trying to accumulate distances in a way that does not reflect the problem's requirements.

### Example Analysis:

Given the example input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the provided program does not compute these values correctly due to the flawed logic described above.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
