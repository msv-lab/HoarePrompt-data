Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is an empty list, `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the new input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing three elements (the original input, the new input `m`, and the latest input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
