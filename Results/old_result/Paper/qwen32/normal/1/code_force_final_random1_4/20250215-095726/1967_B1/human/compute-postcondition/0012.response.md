The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans`. Here's the calculation:

- `ans` is initially set to `n`.
- The line `ans += int(g / count) + 1` updates `ans` by adding the result of `int(g / count) + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `g` is calculated as `(n // 2) - 1`.
- `count` is 2.

So, `int(g / count) + 1` translates to `int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `(n // 2) - 1`.**
