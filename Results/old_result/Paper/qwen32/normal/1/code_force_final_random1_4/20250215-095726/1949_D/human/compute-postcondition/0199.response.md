To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop's behavior step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a`: Cumulative counts of 'F' transitions.
- `b`: Cumulative counts of 'S' transitions.
- `xx`: A list containing `n + 1` elements, where the first element is an empty string and the remaining `n` elements are input strings.
- `sa`: Indices `i` from 1 to `n` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb`: Indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.

### Loop Behavior:
For each iteration `i` from 1 to `n`:
- A new string `nx` is constructed.
- For each character position `j` from 1 to `n`:
  - If the character at `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it is added to `nx`.
  - If the character at `xx[i][j-1]` is '?':
    - If `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, 'F' is added to `nx`.
    - Otherwise, 'S' is added to `nx`.
- The constructed string `nx` is printed.

### Given Outputs:
- After 1 iteration: `nx` is constructed based on `xx[1]`.
- After 2 iterations: `nx` is constructed based on `xx[2]`.
- After 3 iterations: `nx` is `aFbScSdS`, which means `xx[3]` was processed to produce this string.

### Final Output State:
Since the loop runs `n` times, we need to construct `nx` for each `xx[i]` from 1 to `n`. However, the problem statement only provides specific outputs for the first three iterations. To generalize, we can infer that the pattern observed in the third iteration (`aFbScSdS`) will continue similarly for the remaining iterations unless there are changes in `sa` or `sb` that affect the construction of `nx`.

Given the pattern `aFbScSdS`, it seems that:
- Characters that were '?' in `xx[3]` were replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`.
- Since no further specific outputs are provided, we assume the same pattern continues for all subsequent iterations.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations would be a series of constructed strings `nx` for each `xx[i]` from 1 to `n`, following the same pattern as observed in the third iteration.

### Conclusion:
The output state after all iterations will be a series of strings, each constructed based on the rules provided in the loop. Since the problem does not provide more specific details about the input strings `xx[i]` for `i > 3`, we can only describe the general pattern.

However, if we assume the pattern `aFbScSdS` continues for all iterations (which is a reasonable assumption given the information), the final output state can be described as a repetition of such patterns.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the final output state after all iterations would be:

Output State: **aFbScSdSaFbScSdSaFbScSdS... (repeated n times)**

This means that for each of the `n` iterations, the string `aFbScSdS` (or a similar pattern based on the rules) is constructed and printed.
