The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` by reading a new list of integers from the input. This means the previous value of `l` is replaced with the new list provided by the user.

Since `l` changes, `p`, `i`, and `j` also need to be recalculated based on the new `l`. However, the code snippet does not perform these recalculations. Therefore, `p`, `i`, and `j` retain their previous values unless explicitly updated elsewhere in the code (which is not shown here).

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the previous `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in the previous `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in the previous `l`**.

In simpler terms, the list `l` is updated to the new input list, but `p`, `i`, and `j` remain based on the old list `l`.
