Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, and `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`; `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`; `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`; `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the first input integer; `b` is the second input integer; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` hold true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`; `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`; `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`; `m` is `m - 1`; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Regardless of whether `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` holds true or not, the values of `i`, `j`, `p`, `c`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`; `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`; `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`; `m` is `m + 1`; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Regardless of whether `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` holds true or not, the values of `i`, `j`, `p`, `c`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
