The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `j` was either `1` (if `next_x` is `1`) or `0` (otherwise). After incrementing, `j` will be `2` if it was initially `1`, or `1` if it was initially `0`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `i` is `next_x`, `j` is `2` if `next_x` is `1` else `j` is `1`, and `c` is `[0, j]`**
