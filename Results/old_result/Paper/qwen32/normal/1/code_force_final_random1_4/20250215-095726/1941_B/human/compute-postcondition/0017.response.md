Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is the newly input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables `t`, `a`, or `b` are used in this `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
