Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Lists `a` and `b`:** These are lists of integers.
2. **List `new`:** This list is constructed based on the following rules:
   - For indices where `a[j] == b[j]`, `new[j]` takes the value of `max(a[j], b[j])`. Since `a[j]` equals `b[j]`, `max(a[j], b[j])` is simply `a[j]` or `b[j]`.
   - Starting from the smallest index `j` where `a[j] != b[j]`, `new[j]` takes the value of `min(a[j], b[j])` for this index and all subsequent indices.
3. **List `new2`:** This list is constructed similarly but with opposite logic for `min` and `max`:
   - For indices where `a[j] == b[j]`, `new2[j]` takes the value of `min(a[j], b[j])`, which is again `a[j]` or `b[j]`.
   - Starting from the smallest index `j` where `a[j] != b[j]`, `new2[j]` takes the value of `max(a[j], b[j])` for this index and all subsequent indices.
4. **Variable `i`:** This variable is set to `len(a)` if `a` and `b` differ at any index. Otherwise, it remains the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` or `len(a)` if all elements are equal.

The `print` statement outputs the elements of the `new` list joined into a single string.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Case 1:** If `a` and `b` are identical (`a[j] == b[j]` for all `j`), then `new[j]` will be equal to `a[j]` (or `b[j]`) for all `j`. In this case, `new` will be exactly the same as `a` (or `b`).
- **Case 2:** If `a` and `b` differ at some index `k`, then:
  - For indices `j < k`, `new[j]` will be equal to `a[j]` (or `b[j]`).
  - For indices `j >= k`, `new[j]` will be equal to `min(a[j], b[j])`.

Given these rules, the output of the `print` statement will be the string representation of the `new` list, which is constructed based on the comparison between `a` and `b` as described above.

### Final Output:

Output: **string representation of the `new` list (constructed based on the comparison between `a` and `b` as described above)**

To make it more precise, let's consider an example:
- Suppose `a = [1, 3, 5, 7]` and `b = [1, 4, 5, 6]`.
- The lists differ at index 1 (`a[1] != b[1]`).
- For `j < 1`, `new[j] = a[j]` (or `b[j]` since they are equal).
- For `j >= 1`, `new[j] = min(a[j], b[j])`.
- Therefore, `new = [1, 3, 5, 6]`.

In this specific example, the output would be:
Output: **1356**

However, without the specific values of `a` and `b`, the most precise description is:
Output: **string representation of the `new` list (constructed based on the comparison between `a` and `b` as described above)**
