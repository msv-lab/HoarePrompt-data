To determine the new state, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` using the given initial state values.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` must be at least 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2

Let's substitute these values into the expression:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (1 + 2) * 1 = 3 * 1 = 3
   \]

2. Calculate `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   n / 3
   \]
   Since `n` must be at least 3, the minimum value of `n / 3` is `3 / 3 = 1`.

3. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (1 + 2) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6
   \]

4. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   m // 6
   \]
   Since `m` must be at least 6, the minimum value of `m // 6` is `6 // 6 = 1`.

Now, we need to find the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`. Given the minimum values calculated above, the minimum of `1` and `1` is `1`.

Thus, `cnt` is incremented by `1`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
