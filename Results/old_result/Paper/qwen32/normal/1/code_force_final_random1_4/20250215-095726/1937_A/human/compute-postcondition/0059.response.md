Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n_cases` is equal to `t`; `i` is 2; `n` is the integer provided by the user. If `n` is equal to 1, the program does not change any additional variables. Otherwise, `power` is either `ceil(log2(t))` or `ceil(log2(t)) - 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `ceil(log2(t))`. Otherwise, `power` is `ceil(log2(t)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
