The code snippet `results.append(missing)` appends the current value of `missing` to the `results` list. This means that `results` will now include the newly calculated `missing` as its last element.

Other variables such as `freq`, `missing`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character corresponding to `chr(i + ord('A'))` in `a`; `missing` is the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`; `results` now includes the newly calculated `missing` as its last element; `t` is decremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from `test_cases[_]`.**
