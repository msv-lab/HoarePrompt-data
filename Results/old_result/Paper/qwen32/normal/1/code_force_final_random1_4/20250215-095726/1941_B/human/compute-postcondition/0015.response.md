The given code snippet assigns a new integer value to the variable `a` from user input. This means the previous value of `a` is overwritten by the newly input integer. The variables `t` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the newly input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input. The next input for the number of iterations must be greater than 0.**
