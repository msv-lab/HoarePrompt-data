The given code snippet modifies the defaultdict `d1` by setting `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `i + 2` is 4 and `i + 1` is 3.

From the initial state, we know that `d1` can be either `{2: 1, 3: 2}` or `{2: 1, 3: l[2] - l[1] + 1}`. 

If `d1` is `{2: 1, 3: 2}`, then `d1[3]` is 2, and thus `d1[4]` will be `1 + 2`, which equals 3. So, `d1` becomes `{2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3}`.

If `d1` is `{2: 1, 3: l[2] - l[1] + 1}`, then `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, and thus `d1[4]` will be `1 + (l[2] - l[1] + 1)`, which simplifies to `l[2] - l[1] + 2`. So, `d1` becomes `{2: 1, 3: l[2] - l[1] + 1, 4: l[2] - l[1] + 2}`.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains either {2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3} if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or {2: 1, 3: `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, 4: `l[2] - l[1] + 2`} otherwise, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
