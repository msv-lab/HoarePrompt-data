Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in an `n x m` grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Operation Characteristics**: The operation affects a rectangular area and only changes the color of squares that are already the same color as the selected squares.
2. **Grid Configuration**: To make the entire grid the same color, there must be a way to propagate the color of one square to all other squares using the allowed operations.
3. **Critical Condition**: If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have different colors, it's generally impossible to make the whole grid the same color unless there's a continuous path of the same color connecting these corners.

### Solution Explanation:
The provided solution checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color. If they don't, it further checks if there's a continuous path of the same color along the top row or the leftmost column. If such a path exists, it might still be possible to make the entire grid the same color.

However, the logic in the code has some issues:
- The code checks if the top row or the leftmost column has a continuous path of the same color, but this is not sufficient to guarantee that the entire grid can be made the same color.
- It doesn't consider the possibility of having multiple regions of the same color that could eventually be connected through intermediate operations.

### Correctness Analysis:
The provided solution fails to cover all scenarios correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that having a continuous path along the top row or the leftmost column is sufficient to make the entire grid the same color. This is not always true, as there could be isolated regions of the same color that cannot be connected through the allowed operations.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the following grid:
```
WBB
BBW
BBW
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, but there's no continuous path along the top row or the leftmost column that would allow making the entire grid the same color. However, the code would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks the top row and leftmost column.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
