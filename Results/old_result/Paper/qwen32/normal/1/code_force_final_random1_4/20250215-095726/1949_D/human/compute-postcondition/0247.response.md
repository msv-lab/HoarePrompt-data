The code appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition regarding `sb[:n // 4]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the sublist `sb[:n // 4]`**.
