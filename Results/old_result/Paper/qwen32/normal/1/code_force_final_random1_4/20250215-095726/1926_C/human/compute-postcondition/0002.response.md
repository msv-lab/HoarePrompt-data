The given code attempts to add the modulus of the entire list `num` by 10 to the variable `a`. However, the operation `num % 10` is not valid for a list in Python. It seems like the intention might have been to take the modulus of each element in the list by 10 and then sum these values.

Assuming the intention was to sum the last digits of each number in the list `num`, the correct operation would involve iterating through the list and applying the modulus operation to each element. Since the provided code does not include such iteration, it will raise a TypeError.

However, if we interpret the task as intended (summing the last digits of each number in the list), the corrected code would look something like this:

```python
for n in num:
    a = a + n % 10
```

Given the initial state and assuming the corrected interpretation, here's the output state:

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), and the length of `num` is between 1 and \( 10^4 \), inclusive; `a` is the sum of the last digits of each integer in `num`.**

This means `a` will hold the sum of the last digits of all integers in the list `num`.
