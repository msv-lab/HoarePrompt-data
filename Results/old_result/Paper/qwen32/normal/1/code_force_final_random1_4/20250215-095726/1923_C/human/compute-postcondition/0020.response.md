The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `j` was part of the list `c` which was `[0, j, j]`. After incrementing `j`, the list `c` will now be `[0, j, j+1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `c` is `[0, j, j+1]`, `x` is the next element in `l` after the current `x`**.
