Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * i) % i` equals 0, `q` is incremented by 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value, `q` is still incremented by 1, and `x` remains divisible by `i`.**
