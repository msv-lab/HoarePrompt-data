To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `i` is defined as `n - m`. This indicates that `i` is the result of subtracting `m` from `n`.
- `curr` is described as reflecting the net effect of increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`. This suggests that `curr` is a running total that changes depending on the values in `a` and whether those values are found in `b_values`.
- `ans` is described as reflecting how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution. This means `ans` is a counter that increments each time `curr` meets or exceeds the threshold `k`.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will output the final value of `ans`, which is the count of how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` throughout the loop's execution.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b_values`, `k`, and the detailed operations within the loop are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know what `ans` represents based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of how many times curr was greater than or equal to k during the loop's execution)**
