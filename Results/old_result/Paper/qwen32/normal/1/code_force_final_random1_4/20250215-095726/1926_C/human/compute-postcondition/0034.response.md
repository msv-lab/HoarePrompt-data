The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, and assuming that the loop has not yet finished (i.e., `t` is still greater than 0), we decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive minus 1, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`, `i` is 200001, `n` is an input integer.**
