The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input, converted to an integer, to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` changes based on the input provided, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, and `year`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` using the given loop logic.**
