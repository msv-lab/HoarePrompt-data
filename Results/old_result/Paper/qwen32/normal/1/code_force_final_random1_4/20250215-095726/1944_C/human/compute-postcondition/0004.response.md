The code adds the value of `start` to the set `vis`. Given that `start` is initially 0, the set `vis` will now contain the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is {0}.**
