The code snippet reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the user input. The initial value of `n` (which was between 3 and 78) is overwritten by this new input value, which must be a positive integer. The values of `t` and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
