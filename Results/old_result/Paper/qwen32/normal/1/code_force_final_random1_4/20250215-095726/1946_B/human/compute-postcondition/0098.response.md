Given the initial state, the value of `sm` is less than 0, and `a` is calculated as `abs(sm) // 10`. The code modifies `sm` by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` to it.

Let's determine the new value of `sm`:

1. `a = abs(sm) // 10`
2. `sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`

Since `sm` is less than 0, `abs(sm)` is `-sm`. Therefore, `a` becomes `(-sm) // 10`.

Let's denote the original value of `sm` as `sm_original`. Then `a` is `(-sm_original) // 10`.

The new value of `sm` will be:
\[ \text{sm\_new} = \text{sm\_original} + \left(\frac{-\text{sm\_original}}{10} + 1\right) \times (10^9 + 7) \]

Since the exact value of `sm_original` is not specified, we will keep the expression in terms of `sm_original`.

The value of `smin` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `smin`.

Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is `sm_original + ((-sm_original // 10) + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`; `a` is `abs(sm_original) // 10`**
