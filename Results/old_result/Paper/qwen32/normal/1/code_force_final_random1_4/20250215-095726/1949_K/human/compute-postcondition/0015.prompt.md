You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the total number of integers, na, nb, nc are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the total number of integers, `na` is `ceil(n/3)`, `nb` is `floor(n/3)`, `nc` is `floor(n/3)` (or `floor(n/3) - 1` if `n % 3 == 1`), `numbers` is an empty list, `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list, `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`.
    #
    #In natural language:
    #After all iterations, `group_a` will contain every third number starting from the first, `group_b` will contain every third number starting from the second, and `group_c` will contain every third number starting from the third. The sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` will be the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively. The `numbers` list will be empty.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c. Here, group_a contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; group_b contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; and group_c contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is initially an empty list, group_a, group_b, and group_c are also empty lists.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n` (an integer representing the total number of integers), `na`, `nb`, `nc` (integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that their sum equals `n`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). The function returns 'YES' along with three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) if the conditions are met, where `group_a` contains every third element starting from the first, `group_b` contains every third element starting from the second, and `group_c` contains every third element starting from the third. If the conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'. Since `numbers` is initially an empty list, all groups are also empty lists.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c. Here, group_a contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; group_b contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; and group_c contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is initially an empty list, group_a, group_b, and group_c are also empty lists.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
