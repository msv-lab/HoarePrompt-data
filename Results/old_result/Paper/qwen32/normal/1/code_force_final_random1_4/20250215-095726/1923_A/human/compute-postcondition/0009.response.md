The code snippet `n = int(input(''))` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
