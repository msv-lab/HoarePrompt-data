Let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet provided:

### Initial State:
- `test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first element of `feat`.
- `f` is the second element of `feat`.
- `a` is the third element of `feat`.
- `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `array2` is a list containing `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The precondition provides details about the variables and lists involved but does not affect the output of this specific print statement. The condition mentioned (the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` being less than `f`) is used to determine whether this print statement would be executed in a larger context, but it doesn't change the content of what is printed here.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Yes')` statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
