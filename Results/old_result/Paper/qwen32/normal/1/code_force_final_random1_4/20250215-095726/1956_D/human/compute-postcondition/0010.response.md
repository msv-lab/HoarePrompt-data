To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes the `ops` list. The loop iterates over each tuple `(l, r)` in the `ops` list and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Since the loop iterates over all elements in the `ops` list, the final output state will be reached when all tuples in `ops` have been processed. This means that the loop will print `l + 1` and `r + 1` for every tuple `(l, r)` in `ops`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged as it is not used within the loop.
- The values `s` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not used within the loop.
- The list `ops` is fully consumed by the loop, meaning all its tuples have been processed and printed.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where all tuples in `ops` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, the list `a`, the integer `n`, and the values `s` and `m` remain as they were initially, and all operations specified in the `ops` list have been executed and printed.
