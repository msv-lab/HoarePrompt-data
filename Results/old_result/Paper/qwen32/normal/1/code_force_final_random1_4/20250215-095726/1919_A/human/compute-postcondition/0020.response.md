To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `results` is a list containing at least three elements, which includes the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration and at least one more element.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration.
- `t` is set to 1.
- `result` is the next element in `results`.

Given this information, the key point here is understanding what `result` refers to. Since `result` is described as "the next element in `results`," it means that `result` is the element at index `t` in the `results` list because `t` is initialized to 1.

Thus, `result` is `results[1]`.

Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that it is the second element in the `results` list.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the second element of the `results` list.

Output: **results[1] (where results[1] is the second element of the results list)**
