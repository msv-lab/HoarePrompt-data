To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved. The loop iterates over each element in the list `b` and appends its integer value to the list `b_values`. Since the loop continues until all elements in `b` are processed, the final state will reflect this complete iteration.

Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can infer that after all iterations, `b_values` will contain all the integer values from the list `b`.

Let's summarize the final state:

- `custo` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `custos` remains unchanged as no additions to `custo` occur within the loop.
- `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `num_fila` remains `int(nf[0])` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `max_p` remains `int(nf[1])` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `a_values` remains `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `b_values` will now contain all integer values from the list `b` after the loop completes.
- `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing, `b_values` will include all the integer values from the list `b`, while all other variables retain their initial or previously set values.
