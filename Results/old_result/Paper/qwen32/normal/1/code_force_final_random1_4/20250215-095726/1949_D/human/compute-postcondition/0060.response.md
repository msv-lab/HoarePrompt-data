The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented back to `n` (or set to a value less than or equal to `n`), but since the loop increments `i` at the start of each iteration, we should set `i` to `n` right before the loop starts the next iteration.

Thus, to prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be set to `n`.

State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations, `i` is `n`**
