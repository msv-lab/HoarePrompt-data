The code initializes a list `a` with `n` zeros. This means that the length of the list `a` is now `n`, and each element in the list is `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**
