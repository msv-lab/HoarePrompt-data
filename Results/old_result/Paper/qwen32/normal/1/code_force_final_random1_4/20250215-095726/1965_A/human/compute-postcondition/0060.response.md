The given initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `j`, `test`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`:** An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
2. **Variable `n`:** Another input integer.
3. **Variable `l`:** A map object containing integers from the new input.
4. **Variable `lis`:** A sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements.
5. **Variables `i` and `j`:** These are incremented by 1 but their exact values are not relevant to the `print` statement.
6. **Variable `test`:** Remains unchanged but is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('Alice')`, it directly outputs the string `'Alice'` without referencing any of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **Alice**
