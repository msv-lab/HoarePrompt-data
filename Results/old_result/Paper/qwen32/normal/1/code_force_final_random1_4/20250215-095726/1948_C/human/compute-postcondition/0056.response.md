Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` and two strings, each consisting of `n` characters where each character is either '<' or '>'. The function returns "YES" if it's possible to pair each '<' in the first string with a '>' in the second string such that each pair is aligned vertically and no two pairs overlap; otherwise, it returns "NO".**
