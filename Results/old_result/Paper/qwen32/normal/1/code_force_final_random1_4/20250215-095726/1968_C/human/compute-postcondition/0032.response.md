The given code modifies the list `a` by setting the value of `a[i]` to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given that `a` initially has its first element set to 1000 and the rest are zeros, and `x` is a list of integers, the value of `a[i]` will be updated based on the value of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet, let's assume `i` is a valid index within the range of the lists `a` and `x`. After executing the line `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, the value at `a[i]` will be the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

Given that `t` is mentioned to be decreased by 1, this operation does not affect the lists `a` and `x` or the value of `n`. The condition `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for `i > 0`.**
