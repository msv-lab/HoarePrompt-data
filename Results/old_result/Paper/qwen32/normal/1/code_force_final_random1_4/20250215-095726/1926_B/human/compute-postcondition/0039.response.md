The initial state tells us that `k` is a list where the first element is equal to the second element. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference the list `k` or any of its elements. Instead, it directly prints the string `'SQUARE'`.

Therefore, the execution of the `print` statement will simply output the string `'SQUARE'`.

Output: **SQUARE**
