You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

It returns a list of integers, each representing the number of missing problems for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of additional problems needed. Specifically, the code calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level across all rounds, but it does not account for the fact that each round requires a unique set of problems of each difficulty level 'A' through 'G'. 

Let's break down the issue with an example:

Consider the following test case:
- `n = 7`, `m = 2`, `a = 'ABCDEFG'`

In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level for one round. However, since he needs to hold 2 rounds, he needs another complete set of problems of each difficulty level. Therefore, he needs 7 more problems ('ABCDEFG').

However, the current code will calculate the number of missing problems as follows:
- For each difficulty level, the frequency is 1.
- Since `m = 2`, the code will calculate `missing` as `sum(max(0, 2 - 1) for _ in range(7))`, which equals `7`.

While this calculation is correct for this specific example, the code does not generalize correctly for all cases. For instance, if the input is:
- `n = 14`, `m = 2`, `a = 'ABCDEFGABCDEFG'`

The code will still calculate the number of missing problems as 0 because each difficulty level appears twice, which satisfies the requirement for 2 rounds. However, this is incorrect because each round needs a unique set of problems, and having all problems of the same difficulty level repeated does not satisfy the requirement.

To fix this, the code should ensure that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level. This means that the code should check if the frequency of each difficulty level is at least `m` and calculate the missing problems accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        missing = sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))
        results.append(missing)
    return results

# Corrected version
def func_1_corrected(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        missing = sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))
        results.append(missing * m)  # Each round needs a unique set of problems
    return results
```

However, the above correction is still incorrect. The correct approach should be:

```python
def func_1_corrected(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]

        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        missing = sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))

The correct approach should be:

```python
def func_1_corrected_final(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        missing = sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))
        results.append(missing)
    return results
```
