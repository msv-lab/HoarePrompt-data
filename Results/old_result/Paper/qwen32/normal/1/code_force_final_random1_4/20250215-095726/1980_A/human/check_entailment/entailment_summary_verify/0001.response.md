Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - He has `n` problems available, each with a specific difficulty level.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round can have one problem of each difficulty level.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program defines `t` as the number of test cases and `test_cases` as a list of tuples containing `n`, `m`, and `a` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case by:
     - Initializing a frequency array `freq` of size 7 to count occurrences of each difficulty level.
     - Iterating through the string `a` to populate the `freq` array.
     - Calculating the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level using `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the current frequency of a difficulty level.
     - Summing up the missing problems across all difficulty levels and appending this total to the `results` list.
     - Returning the `results` list.

3. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the function's behavior: it calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the current distribution of problem difficulties and the required number of problems per difficulty level for upcoming rounds.

4. **Verification Against Example:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2, A=0, F=0.
     - Missing: A=1, F=1 (since each difficulty level is needed once per round).
     - Total missing: 2.
     - Output: 2 (correct).
   - **Test Case 2:** `n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2, A=0, F=0.
     - Missing: A=2, F=2 (since each difficulty level is needed twice per round).
     - Total missing: 4.
     - Output: 5 (incorrect, should be 5 because we need 2 for A and 2 for F, plus 1 more for any other missing difficulty level like C).
   - **Test Case 3:** `n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2, A=0.
     - Missing: A=1 (since each difficulty level is needed once per round).
     - Total missing: 1.
     - Output: 1 (correct).

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the first and third test cases but incorrectly handles the second test case.
- The issue arises because the program does not account for the fact that if `m` rounds are needed, each difficulty level must appear at least `m` times. The current implementation only calculates the deficit for each difficulty level but does not ensure that the total number of problems meets the requirement for `m` rounds.

### Corrected Logic:
- For each test case, calculate the frequency of each difficulty level.
- Determine the number of problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
- Sum the deficits to get the total number of additional problems needed.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the incorrect handling of the second test case, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
