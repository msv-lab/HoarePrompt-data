Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no additional changes are made to `A`, `B`, or `C`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, no additional changes are made to `A`, `B`, or `C`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
