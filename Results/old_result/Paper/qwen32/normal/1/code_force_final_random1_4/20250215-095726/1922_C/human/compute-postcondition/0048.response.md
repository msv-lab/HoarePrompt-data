To determine the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

1. **Variables and Initializations:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, meaning it will return 0 for any key that does not exist.
   - `d2`: Another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, also initialized to 0 for non-existent keys.
   - `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on some loop logic (not detailed here).
   - `m`: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x` and `y`: Two integers obtained from new input.
   - The relationship between `x` and `y` is given as: if `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - `j`: Initialized to 1.

2. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - Since `d2` is a `defaultdict(int)`, any access to a key that hasn't been set explicitly will return 0.
   - The values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` depend on how `d2` is updated in the loop logic, which isn't provided. Therefore, we can only assume they could be any integer values, but if not explicitly set, they default to 0.
   - The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will subtract the value associated with key `x` from the value associated with key `y` in `d2`.

3. **Output Analysis:**
   - Given the lack of specific updates to `d2` in the provided information, the most precise description we can give is that `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are integers, possibly 0 if never set.
   - The result of `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be an integer, which could be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement is:

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values associated with keys y and x in the defaultdict d2, respectively)**
