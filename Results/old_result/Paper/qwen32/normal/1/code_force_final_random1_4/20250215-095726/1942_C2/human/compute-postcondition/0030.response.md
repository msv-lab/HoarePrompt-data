Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 5. If `a[5] - a[4] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[5] - a[4]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[5] - a[4]) // 2 - 1`, then `tmp` contains the additional element `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `tmp`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2 - 1`. No changes are made to `tmp`, `ans`, or `y` in any other case.**
