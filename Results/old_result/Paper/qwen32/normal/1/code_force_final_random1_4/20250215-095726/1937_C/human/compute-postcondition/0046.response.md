The code snippet `k = i` assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Given the initial state, the value of `k` changes from 1 to the value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received; `res` is the value of the input received and `res` equals `'<'`.**
