Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n` (an integer representing the total number of integers), `na`, `nb`, `nc` (integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that their sum equals `n`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). The function returns 'YES' along with three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) if the conditions are met, where `group_a` contains every third element starting from the first, `group_b` contains every third element starting from the second, and `group_c` contains every third element starting from the third. If the conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'. Since `numbers` is initially an empty list, all groups are also empty lists.**
