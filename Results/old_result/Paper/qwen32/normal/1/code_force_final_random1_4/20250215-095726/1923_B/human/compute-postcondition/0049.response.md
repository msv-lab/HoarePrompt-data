The code snippet `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Given that `delta` is 0, the value of `rest` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only thing that changes is the explicit acknowledgment that `rest` has not changed.

Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `rest` must be non-zero, `delta = 0`, `pos` must be less than 3**
