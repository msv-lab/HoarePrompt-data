Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. If `n` is not equal to `m`, the following conditions apply: if `m` is greater than `n`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and either `m` equals `n - 1` or both `m` and `n` are even, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of `m` or `n` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` equals `m`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `m` is greater than `n`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` equals `n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. In all other cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged regardless of whether both `m` and `n` are even or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` equals `m`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
