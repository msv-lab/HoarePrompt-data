The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2` and `n` is 2, `m` evaluates to `(2 + 1) // 2`, which is `3 // 2`, resulting in `1`. Therefore, `L`, which was initially `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]` or `[1, 1]`, will now be `[1, 1, 1]`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 3; `n` is 2; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is `[1, 1, 1]`; `tot` is 5; `pow` is 8; `m` is 1**.
