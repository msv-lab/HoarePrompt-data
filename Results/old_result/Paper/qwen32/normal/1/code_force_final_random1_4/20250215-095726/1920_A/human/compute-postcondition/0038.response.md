Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `i` is incremented by 1; `t` and `v` are integers obtained from the input; if `t` equals 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is updated to the value of `v`; if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to the value of `v`; if `t` equals 3, then `v` is appended to `num`.**
