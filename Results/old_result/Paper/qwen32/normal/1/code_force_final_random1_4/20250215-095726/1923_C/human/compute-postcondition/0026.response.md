In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function produces a sequence with at least one element, which means `m` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`) are not directly involved in the condition for the loop to execute.

Let's analyze the state before the loop starts:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input
- `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`
- `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`
- `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`
- `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`

To ensure the loop executes, the only variable we can adjust according to the loop head is `m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`**
