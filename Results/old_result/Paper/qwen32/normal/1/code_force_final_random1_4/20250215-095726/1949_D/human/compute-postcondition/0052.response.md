The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the array `a` by 1. This affects only the array `a` and does not change the values of `x`, `xx`, `b`, `j`, or `n`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the element at index `i` in the array `a` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` is updated such that `a[i]` is incremented by 1, `b` arrays are based on previous counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.**
