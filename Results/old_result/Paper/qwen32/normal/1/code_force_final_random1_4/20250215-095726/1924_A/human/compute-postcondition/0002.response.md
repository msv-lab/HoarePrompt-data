The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. This means the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `m` provided in the initial state are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given that the initial state specifies the ranges for `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the code overwrites these variables, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `k`, and `m` as read from the input. The variable `s` remains unchanged because it is not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets**.
