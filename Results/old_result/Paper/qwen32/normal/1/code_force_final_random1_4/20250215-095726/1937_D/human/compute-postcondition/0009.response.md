The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, and the calculation of `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `A` now contains one element, which is the value of `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list containing one element `x`, `idx_A` is a non-empty list, `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)`**.
