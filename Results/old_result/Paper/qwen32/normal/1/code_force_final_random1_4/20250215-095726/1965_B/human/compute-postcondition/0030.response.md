The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value being appended. Since the value of `i` is unknown, we'll represent the appended value as `2 ** i`.

Output State: **`n` is 32, `k` is 10, `b` is '100000', `l` is 6, `bk` is '1010', `ans` is [2, 8, 16, 32, -49, 11, 21, 2 ** i], `lk` is 5**
