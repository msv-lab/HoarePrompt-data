Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440. Each test case consists of a string `s` of length 5 formatted as "hh:mm", representing a time in hours and minutes. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given time.**
