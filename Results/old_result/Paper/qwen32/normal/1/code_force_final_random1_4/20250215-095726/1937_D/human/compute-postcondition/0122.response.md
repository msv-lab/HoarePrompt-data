Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `b` has been updated to be the original value of `b` minus `B[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
