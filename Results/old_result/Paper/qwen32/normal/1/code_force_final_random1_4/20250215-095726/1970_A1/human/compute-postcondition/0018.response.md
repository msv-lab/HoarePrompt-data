Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `balance_info` contains a new `BalanceInfo` object with the arguments `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]` appended to it; `balance` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the string `s` remains unchanged as it still consists only of balanced parentheses. The length `n` of `s` remains the same. The index `i` is incremented by 1. The `balance_info` list now includes a new `BalanceInfo` object with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. The `balance` variable is reduced by 1.
