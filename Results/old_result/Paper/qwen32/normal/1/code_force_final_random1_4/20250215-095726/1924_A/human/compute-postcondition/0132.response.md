Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to its previous value plus \(2^{\text{cur\_ss}}\). `cnt` is 1 if `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1` after the update, otherwise `cnt` remains 0. `ans` is a string containing the value of `ss` if `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1` after the update, otherwise `ans` remains an empty string. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) != 0`, then `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `ss` is still the next character in the string `s`.**
