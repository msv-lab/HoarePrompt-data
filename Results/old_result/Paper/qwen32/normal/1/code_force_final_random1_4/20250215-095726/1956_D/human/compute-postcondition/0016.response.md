Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of the elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in the list `a` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` was not equal to `l` initially, `pos` may have changed based on the function's logic.**
