In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range defined by the variable `tt`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `tt` since it directly influences whether the loop will run or not.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for ii in range(tt):` will execute if `tt` is greater than 0. If `tt` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
2. The variable `t` is mentioned as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but it is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute.
3. The variable `ii` is the loop variable and is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust its initial state manually.

Given this, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `tt` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than 0**
