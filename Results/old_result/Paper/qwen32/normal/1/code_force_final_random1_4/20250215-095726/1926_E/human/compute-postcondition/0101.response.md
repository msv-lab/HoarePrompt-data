To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement step by step using the given initial state:

The expression is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `pow` is 4
- `k` is the second integer from the input (let's denote it as `k`)
- `tot` is 2

Let's substitute these values into the expression:

1. Calculate `k - tot`:
   \[
   k - tot = k - 2
   \]

2. Multiply the result by 2:
   \[
   2 * (k - 2)
   \]

3. Subtract 1 from the result:
   \[
   2 * (k - 2) - 1
   \]

4. Finally, multiply the entire result by `pow` (which is 4):
   \[
   4 * (2 * (k - 2) - 1)
   \]

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[
4 * (2 * (k - 2) - 1)
\]

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can express the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **4 * (2 * (k - 2) - 1) (where k is the second integer from the input)**
