The code snippet appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `resultats` now includes `-1` appended to its previous contents.**
