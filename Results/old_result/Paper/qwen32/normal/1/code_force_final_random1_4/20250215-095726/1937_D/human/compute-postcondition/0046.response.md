Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
