Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains either {2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 4} if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or {2: 1, 3: l[2] - l[1] + 1, 4: l[2] - l[1] + 2, 5: l[2] - l[1] + 3} otherwise, or {2: 1, 3: l[2] - l[1] + 1, 4: l[3] - l[1] + 1, 5: l[3] - l[1] + 2}. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1` also includes {5: 4}. Otherwise, `d1` includes {5: l[4] - l[3] + 3}, or {5: l[4] - l[3] + (l[2] - l[1] + 2)}, or {5: l[4] - l[3] + (l[3] - l[1] + 1)}. `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
