### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with their wallets.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- Each player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
- The game revolves around the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
- If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
- The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each.

#### Code Review:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly checks if `a + b` is even or odd and returns "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.
- The function `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the results.

#### Testing Potential Cases:
Let's consider the provided test cases and verify the logic:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `a + b = 2` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

2. **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - `a + b = 5` (odd), Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Actual Output: "Alice"

3. **Test Case 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - `a + b = 8` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

4. **Test Case 4**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `a + b = 2000000000` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

5. **Test Case 5**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
   - `a + b = 55134` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the expected outputs for some of the test cases:

- **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - `a + b = 5` (odd), Expected Output: "Alice" (as per the problem statement)
  - Actual Output: "Alice" (from the program)

- **Test Case 5**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
  - `a + b = 55134` (even), Expected Output: "Bob" (as per the problem statement)
  - Actual Output: "Bob" (from the program)

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment seems to have a mistake in the expected output for Test Case 5. According to the problem statement, if `a + b` is even, Bob should win. Therefore, the expected output for `a = 53110`, `b = 2024` should indeed be "Bob".

The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the sum of coins. The discrepancies noted were due to misinterpretation of the expected outputs in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing of various cases, the program appears to be correct. It accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins in both players' wallets.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
