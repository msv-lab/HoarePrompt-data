To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

The provided loop iterates over each element in `b_values` and sets the corresponding value in `cnt_b` to 0. The variables `i`, `curr`, and `ans` are mentioned as being part of the state but are not modified within the loop. Therefore, their values will remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.

Here's the loop again for reference:
```python
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0
```

### Analysis of the Loop Execution:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `i` is set to `n - m`.
- **Loop Iteration**: For each iteration, `i` takes on the value of the next element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` is set to 0.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when all elements in `b_values` have been processed.

### Final Output State:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following will be true:
- `i` will hold the last element of `b_values` (or will be undefined if `b_values` is empty, but the problem states that `b_values` contains at least one element).
- `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for every `i` in `b_values`.
- `curr` and `ans` will remain unchanged from their initial values because they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be:
- `i` will be the last element of `b_values`.
- `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.
- `curr` and `ans` will retain their initial values.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`, and `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.**
