### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The variable `t` represents the number of test cases.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n` (number of problems), `m` (number of rounds), and `a` (string of problem difficulties).

2. **Function Definition (`func_1`)**:
   - This function processes each test case to determine how many additional problems Vlad needs to create.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it unpacks the values `n`, `m`, and `a`.
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (since there are 7 difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G') to count occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a`.

4. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `freq` array based on the character's position relative to 'A'.

5. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - It calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by taking the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` (number of rounds) and the frequency of each difficulty level.
   - It sums these values to get the total number of missing problems for the current test case and appends this value to the `results` list.

6. **Returning Results**:
   - After processing all test cases, it returns the `results` list containing the number of missing problems for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Missing Problems**:
  - The calculation `sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)` is incorrect because it assumes that each difficulty level must appear at least `m` times across all rounds, which is not the requirement.
  - The requirement is that each round must have one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, for `m` rounds, each difficulty level should appear at least `m` times in total, but the current implementation incorrectly treats each difficulty level independently for each round.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that each difficulty level appears at least `m` times in total across all rounds. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, a = test_cases[_]
        
        freq = [0] * 7
        
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        
        missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
        
        # Each difficulty level must appear at least m times in total
        total_missing = max(0, m * 7 - sum(freq))
        
        results.append(total_missing)
        
    return results
```

However, the original implementation does not correctly address the problem requirements, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
