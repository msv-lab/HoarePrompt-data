The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given that the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we assume `nx` was a string before this operation. After appending 'F', `nx` will be whatever its original value was plus 'F'.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'**.
