Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 2, then no additional changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, `b` is the string `s` sorted alphabetically, `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and if `b` is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted alphabetically; otherwise, `s` is not sorted alphabetically.**
