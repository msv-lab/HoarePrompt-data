To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the number of opening parentheses `(` equals the number of closing parentheses `)`, and at no point in the sequence does the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening ones.
2. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
   - Compute the balance of each prefix of the input sequence.
   - Sort these prefixes based on their balance in ascending order. If two prefixes have the same balance, sort them by their position in descending order.
   - Form a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Provided Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to be intended for comparison but is not used in the provided code. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the sequence.
  - Iterates over the input string `s`, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
  - Sorts `balance_info` using a lambda function that sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
  - Constructs the result string from the sorted `balance_info` and prints it.

### Code Issues:
- The program uses a class `BalanceInfo` which is not defined in the provided code snippet. This class should have attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.
- The sorting logic seems correct based on the problem statement.
- The construction of the result string from the sorted `balance_info` is correct.

### Implementation of Missing Class:
To ensure the program runs correctly, the missing `BalanceInfo` class should be implemented as follows:
```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

### Conclusion:
Assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is correctly implemented, the logic of the provided program matches the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
