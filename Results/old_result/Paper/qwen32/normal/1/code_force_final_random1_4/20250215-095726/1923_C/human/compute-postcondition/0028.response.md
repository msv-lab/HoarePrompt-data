The given code snippet modifies the value of `i`. The new value of `i` is calculated as the difference between the cumulative counts of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative counts of `1`s up to index `a-1`.

Given:
- `c` is a list where `c[k]` represents the cumulative count of `1`s from the start of the list `l` up to (but not including) index `k`.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.

The new value of `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which essentially gives the count of `1`s in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**
