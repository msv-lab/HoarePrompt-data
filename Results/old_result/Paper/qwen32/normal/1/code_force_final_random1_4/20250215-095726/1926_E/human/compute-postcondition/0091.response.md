Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is set to 3.
- `n` is set to 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `L` is a list `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- `tot` is set to 0.
- `pow` is set to 1.
- `m` is set to 1.
- There is a condition that `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
- `tot` is explicitly given as 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input, but since it's not specified, we'll keep it as `k`.
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

Substituting the known values:
- `pow` = 1
- `tot` = 0

So the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{print}(1 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1)) \]
\[ \text{print}(1 * (2 * k - 1)) \]
\[ \text{print}(2 * k - 1) \]

Thus, the output depends on the value of `k`, which is the second integer from the input.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is the second integer from the input.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the second integer from the input)**
