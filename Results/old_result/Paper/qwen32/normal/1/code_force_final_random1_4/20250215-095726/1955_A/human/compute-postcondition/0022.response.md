To determine the output of the `print(A * B)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `X` is not defined or retains its previous value (which is irrelevant for this print statement).
- `i` is k + 1 (which is also irrelevant for this print statement).

The key variables here are `A` and `B`, both of which are integers read from the input. Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical result. However, we know that the output will be the product of these two integers.

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
