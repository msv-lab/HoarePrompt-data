The given code snippet sorts the list `final`. This means that the order of elements within `final` will be changed to ascending order, but the contents of `final` remain the same.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**

In simpler terms, the list `final` is now sorted in ascending order, while all other variables retain their previous values.
