To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `t` is greater than the new value of `i`.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `count` is set to `m + 1`.
- `ans` is the accumulated sum calculated as described.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(ans))
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement converts `ans` to an integer and prints it. To determine what is printed, we need to understand the value of `ans`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `ans` is the accumulated sum calculated as described, but the description does not specify how `ans` is calculated. However, since `ans` is mentioned as an accumulated sum, it implies that `ans` holds some computed value based on the inputs and possibly other variables like `i`, `n`, `m`, etc.

Given that the exact method of calculating `ans` is not specified, we can only describe `ans` based on the information provided.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of `ans`, which is an accumulated sum calculated based on the inputs and other variables described in the initial state.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum calculated based on the inputs and other variables described in the initial state)**
