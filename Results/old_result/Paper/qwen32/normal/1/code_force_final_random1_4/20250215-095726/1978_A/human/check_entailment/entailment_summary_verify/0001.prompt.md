You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` integers and the last integer in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and maximize the sum of the largest book in each pile. The key point here is that we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and choose the division that gives the maximum sum of the largest books in each pile.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided code snippet does not correctly solve the problem. Here’s why:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.
3. It calculates the maximum number of pages in all books except the last one (`max(nums[:-1])`) and adds it to the number of pages in the last book (`nums[-1]`).
4. It prints this sum as the result.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The code does not consider all possible ways to split the books into two non-empty piles.
- It assumes that the optimal solution is always to take the largest book from all but the last book and add it to the last book. This is not necessarily true.
- The code fails to check other possible splits, which might yield a higher sum.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Sort the list of books by the number of pages in descending order.
2. Consider the two largest books; these will be the ones that maximize the sum when placed in separate piles.

Here’s how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
