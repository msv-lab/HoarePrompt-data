The given code snippet only updates the value of `i`. The new value of `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. Since the problem states that `i` was already defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]` before the code snippet, the value of `i` remains unchanged by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State except that we reiterate the definition of `i` for clarity.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` is `m - 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.**
