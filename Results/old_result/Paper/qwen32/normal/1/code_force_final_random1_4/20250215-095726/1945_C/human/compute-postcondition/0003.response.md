The code snippet reads an input string `s`. This input does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, or `a` directly. The variable `s` is newly introduced and assigned the value of the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string.**
