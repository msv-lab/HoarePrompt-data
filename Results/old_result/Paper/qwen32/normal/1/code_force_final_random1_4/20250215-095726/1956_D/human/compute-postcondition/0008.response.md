To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `(l, r)` and `ops`.

Given:
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples.
- `(l, r)` is the next tuple in `ops`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `(l, r)` has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple in `ops` to process.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple in `ops`.

Let's denote the next tuple in `ops` as `(l_next, r_next)`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples; `(l, r)` is the next tuple in `ops` which is `(l_next, r_next)`**

Since we don't have specific values for `l_next` and `r_next`, we express the state in terms of these variables.

Final Answer:
State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples; `(l, r)` is `(l_next, r_next)`**
