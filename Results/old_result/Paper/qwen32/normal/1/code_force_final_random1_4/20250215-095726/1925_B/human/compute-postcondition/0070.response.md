To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit upper limit `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 5.

There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 5, and `ans` retains its previous value unless `x % i == 0`. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 4`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.**
