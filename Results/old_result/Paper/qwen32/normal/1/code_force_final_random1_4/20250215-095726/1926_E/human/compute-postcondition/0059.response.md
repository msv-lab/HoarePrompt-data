The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given the initial state, `pow` is initially 1. After executing the code, `pow` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [3, 1, 1], `pow` is 2, `m` is 1, `tot` is `tot + a`. If `tot` (before increment) is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` (after increment) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `tot` relative to the condition.**
