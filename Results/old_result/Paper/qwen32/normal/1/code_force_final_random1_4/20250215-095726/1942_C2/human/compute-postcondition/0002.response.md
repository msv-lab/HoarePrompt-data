The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and `tt` must be greater than 0. These conditions are not affected by the code snippet provided.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are set based on the input. The output state includes these new assignments while keeping the conditions on `t` and `tt` unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input.**
