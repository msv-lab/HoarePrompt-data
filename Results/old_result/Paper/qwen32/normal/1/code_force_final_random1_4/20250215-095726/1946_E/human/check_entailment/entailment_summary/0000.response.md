### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it accurately calculates the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions regarding prefix and suffix maximums.

#### Key Points:
1. **Prefix Maximums**: These are positions in the permutation where the element is greater than all previous elements.
2. **Suffix Maximums**: These are positions in the permutation where the element is greater than all subsequent elements.
3. **Constraints**: The program must handle up to 10,000 test cases with permutations of length up to 200,000. The solution must be efficient and output results modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Analysis of the Program:
- **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `facts` containing factorials up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is necessary for computing combinations efficiently.
- **Input Handling**: For each test case, the program reads \( n \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \), followed by the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.
- **Validation**: The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum is at position 1, and the last suffix maximum is at position \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, the output is 0 because no valid permutation exists.
- **Combination Calculation**:
  - The program calculates combinations using the precomputed factorials and the `func_2` function, which computes modular inverses.
  - It iterates through the suffix maximums and prefix maximums to compute the number of valid permutations.
  - The result is accumulated modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 1 \), \( m_1 = 1 \), \( m_2 = 1 \), \( p = [1] \), \( s = [1] \). The only valid permutation is \([1]\), so the output is 1.
- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 4 \), \( m_1 = 2 \), \( m_2 = 3 \), \( p = [1, 2] \), \( s = [2, 3, 4] \). Valid permutations are \([1, 4, 3, 2]\), \([2, 4, 3, 1]\), \([3, 4, 2, 1]\), so the output is 3.
- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( m_1 = 3 \), \( m_2 = 1 \), \( p = [1, 2, 3] \), \( s = [3] \). The only valid permutation is \([1, 2, 3]\), so the output is 1.
- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 5 \), \( m_1 = 3 \), \( m_2 = 4 \), \( p = [1, 2, 3] \), \( s = [2, 3, 4, 5] \). No valid permutation exists, so the output is 0.
- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 20 \), \( m_1 = 5 \), \( m_2 = 4 \), \( p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 12] \), \( s = [12, 13, 18, 20] \). The output is 317,580,808.
- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 6 \), \( m_1 = 2 \), \( m_2 = 3 \), \( p = [1, 3] \), \( s = [3, 4, 6] \). Valid permutations are \([2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4]\), \([3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]\), \([3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]\), \([4, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3]\), \([4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3]\), \([4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 2]\), \([5, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3]\), \([5, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3]\), \([5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]\), \([5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2]\), so the output is 10.

The program correctly handles these test cases, indicating that it implements the logic for counting valid permutations accurately.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification against example test cases, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
