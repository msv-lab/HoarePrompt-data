The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains two more elements (one more element which is the input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless changed, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is 5**
