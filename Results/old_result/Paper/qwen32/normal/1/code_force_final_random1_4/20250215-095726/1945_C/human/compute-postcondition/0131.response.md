The code sorts the list `final`. This means the order of elements in `final` will change to be in ascending order. The values of `mini` remain unchanged because sorting does not affect the minimum absolute difference calculated earlier.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
