Output State: **`y` is 1, `custo` is 155, `custos` is `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` is `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input. Additionally, `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
