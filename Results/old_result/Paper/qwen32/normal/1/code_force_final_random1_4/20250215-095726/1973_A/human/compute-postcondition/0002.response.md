The given code snippet calculates the sum of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and assigns it to the variable `total_points`. However, the initial state does not specify the existence of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` as individual variables. Instead, these values are part of the tuples within the `cas_de_test` list.

Given the initial state, the code snippet provided does not directly affect `t`, `cas_de_test`, or `resultats`. Since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not defined in the initial state, we assume they are meant to be the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. Therefore, `total_points` will be calculated using the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Let's denote the first tuple in `cas_de_test` as `(p1, p2, p3)`. After executing the code, `total_points` will be `p1 + p2 + p3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.**
