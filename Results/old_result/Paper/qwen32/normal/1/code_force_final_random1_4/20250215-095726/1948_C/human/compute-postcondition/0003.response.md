The code snippet provided reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` is an input integer, and there are two strings consisting of '<' and '>' characters.

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` will hold the value of the input string. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the precondition about the strings still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `a` is the input string.**
