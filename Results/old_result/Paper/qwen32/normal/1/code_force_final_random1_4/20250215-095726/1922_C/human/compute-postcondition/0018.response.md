The code snippet updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2` by setting it to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `d1[5]` is updated to `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d1[5]` is now `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
