The code adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This means that `neighbor` is now included in the `visited` collection. The values of `current`, `queue`, and `tree[current]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one neighbor. Additionally, `neighbor` is in `visited`.**
