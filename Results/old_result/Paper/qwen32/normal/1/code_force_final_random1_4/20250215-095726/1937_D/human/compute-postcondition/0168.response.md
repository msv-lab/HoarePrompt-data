To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the variables and their relationships based on the initial state provided:

1. **String `s`**: Consists of '<' and '>'.
2. **Length `n`**: Length of the string `s` and is greater than 0.
3. **List `A`**: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
4. **List `idx_A`**: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
5. **List `B`**: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
6. **List `idx_B`**: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
7. **Variable `i`**: Defined as `i_end + 2`.
8. **Variable `a`**: Defined as `A[l]`.
9. **Variable `x`**: Defined as `r - (l + 2)`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is calculated as `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
10. **Variable `b`**: Finally, `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Given the complexity of the calculations and the lack of specific values for `s`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `i_end`, `l`, and `r`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`.

However, we can describe the expression that will be printed based on the given variables:

- `a * 2`: Twice the value of `a` (which is `A[l]`).
- `b * 2`: Twice the value of `b` (which is calculated based on the conditions provided).
- `i + 1`: One more than the value of `i` (which is `i_end + 2`).

Combining these, the expression inside the `print` statement is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a = A[l], b is calculated based on the conditions provided, and i = i_end + 2)**
