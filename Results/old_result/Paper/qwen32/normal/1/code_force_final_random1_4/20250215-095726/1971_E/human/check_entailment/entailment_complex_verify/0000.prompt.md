You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

    #State: All `t` iterations have been completed. For each iteration, the following steps were performed:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, along with two lists `a` and `b` of length `k`, and `q` queries `d`. For each query `d`, it calculates and prints a value based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes the following:
1. The final destination `n`, the number of points `k`, and the number of queries `q`.
2. The list of points `a` where the car arrives at specific times `b`.
3. It calculates the distances between consecutive points `ad` and the corresponding time differences `bd`.
4. It computes the speeds `v` for each segment between points.
5. For each query `d`, it determines the segment the point `d` falls into using binary search (`bisect_left`).
6. It calculates the exact time taken to reach point `d` based on the segment information and prints the result.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases such as:
   - When `d` is exactly at a known point `a_i`.
   - When `d` is at the start or end of the number line.
   - When there is only one segment (i.e., `k=1`).

2. **Correct Speed Calculation**: The speed calculation for each segment should be accurate.
3. **Time Calculation**: The time calculation for reaching a point within a segment should be correct.
4. **Binary Search Usage**: The usage of `bisect_left` should correctly identify the segment for the query point `d`.

### Testing Potential Cases

Let's consider some potential cases:

1. **Exact Match at Known Point**:
   - Input: `n=10, k=1, q=1`, `a=[10]`, `b=[10]`, `d=10`
   - Expected Output: `10`
   - The program correctly identifies the exact match and returns `10`.

2. **Point Between Known Points**:
   - Input: `n=10, k=2, q=1`, `a=[4, 10]`, `b=[4, 7]`, `d=6`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - The program correctly identifies the segment `[4, 10]` and calculates the time as `5`.

3. **Point at Start or End**:
   - Input: `n=10, k=1, q=2`, `a=[10]`, `b=[10]`, `d=0`, `d=10`
   - Expected Output: `0 10`
   - The program correctly handles the start point and returns `0` for `d=0`.

4. **Single Segment**:
   - Input: `n=10, k=1, q=2`, `a=[10]`, `b=[10]`, `d=5`, `d=10`
   - Expected Output: `5 10`
   - The program correctly handles a single segment and calculates the time accurately.

5. **Large Numbers**:
   - Input: `n=1000000000, k=1, q=1`, `a=[1000000000]`, `b=[1000000000]`, `d=99999999`
   - Expected Output: `99999999`
   - The program correctly handles large numbers and calculates the time accurately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing several potential cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all specified scenarios according to the problem description. There are no evident issues or edge cases that the program fails to address.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all edge cases, including exact matches at known points, points between known points, points at the start or end, single segments, and large numbers. The speed and time calculations are accurate, and the use of `bisect_left` correctly identifies the relevant segment for each query.
