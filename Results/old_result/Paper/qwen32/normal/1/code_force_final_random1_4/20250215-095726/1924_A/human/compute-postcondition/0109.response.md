The given code snippet appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. 

Based on the initial state, `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters, and `tmp` is either `'a' + (k - 1)` if the `k`-th bit of `cur` is not set, or an empty string if it is set.

After executing `ans += tmp`, the new value of `ans` will be the original `ans` concatenated with `tmp`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; n and k remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; m remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; s remains the same non-empty string read from the input; cnt is less than n; ans is a string containing the last character from each sequence of k unique characters plus the value of tmp; tmp is 'a' + (k - 1) if the k-th bit of cur is not set, otherwise tmp remains an empty string; i is k; cur is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach k unique characters.**
