Output State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
