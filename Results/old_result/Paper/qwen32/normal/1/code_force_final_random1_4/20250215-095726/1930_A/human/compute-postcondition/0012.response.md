The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute as many times as the integer provided by `input()`. Since `_` does not affect the state of other variables within the loop, we don't need to adjust its value manually; it will be incremented automatically by the `range` function.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the input integer (which determines the number of iterations) must be decremented by 1 each time the loop completes an iteration. But since we are looking at the state just before the next iteration starts, we don't change the input integer itself. Instead, we acknowledge that the loop will continue to execute as long as the input integer is greater than 0.

Given that the loop head does not involve `t`, `n`, `l`, or `score`, these variables remain unchanged. The state of the program just before the next iteration starts is the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop control variable `_` is implicitly set to the next value by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state remains:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices of `l` (i.e., `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*(n-1)]`)**.
