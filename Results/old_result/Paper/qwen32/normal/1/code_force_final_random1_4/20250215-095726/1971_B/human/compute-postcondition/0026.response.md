Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new input string `s`, `b` is the original `s` sorted alphabetically, `c` is the original `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and if `b` is equal to the original `s`, then the original `s` is already sorted alphabetically; otherwise, the original `s` is not sorted alphabetically, `i` is `i + 1`. Regardless of whether the length of `a` is 2 or not, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described.**
