Output State: **`even` is a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0 with at least one more element, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list, `y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * 0`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` has been set to 0. The values of `even`, `gap`, and `ans` remain as described in the initial state, except `y` is now 0, and `ans` is updated to `ans + gap`.
