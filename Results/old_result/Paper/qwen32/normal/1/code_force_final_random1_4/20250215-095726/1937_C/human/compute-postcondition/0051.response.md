Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received; `res` is the value of the input received, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the last iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` is now set to the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous values.
