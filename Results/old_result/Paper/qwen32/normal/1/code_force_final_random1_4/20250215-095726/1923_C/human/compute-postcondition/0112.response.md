Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `x` is an integer.
- `i` is increased by `x`.
- If `x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
- `p` has `i` appended to it.

### Code Snippet:
```python
c.append(j)
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The variable `c` has `j` appended to it.

### Output State Calculation:
- `x` remains an integer.
- `i` is increased by `x` (this was already done in the initial state, so no further change here).
- `j` remains unchanged unless `x` was 1, in which case it was increased by 1 (this was also handled in the initial state).
- `p` has `i` appended to it (this was already done in the initial state, so no further change here).
- `c` now includes `j` as its last element.

### Output State:
Output State: **`x` is an integer; `i` is increased by `x`; if `x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `p` has `i` appended to it; `c` has `j` appended to it.**
