The given code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them into `u` and `v`, and converts them to integers. This means the values of `u` and `v` will be updated to the new input values.

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the sublist at index `v` contains the values `v` and `u`; the sublists at other indices contain their original values; `u` is an input integer minus 1; `v` is an input integer minus 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `u` and `v` are reassigned to the new input values (not `input integer minus 1` anymore).

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the sublist at index `v` contains the values `v` and `u`; the sublists at other indices contain their original values; `u` is the first input integer; `v` is the second input integer.**
