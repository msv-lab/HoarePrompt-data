The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the value at index `i + 1` in the list `a` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is 0, but this does not affect the value at `a[i + 1]`.

Since `a[i + 1]` is being updated, its new value will be its original value minus `2 * opNum`. However, the initial value of `a[i + 1]` is not specified, so we'll denote it as `a[i + 1]` before the operation and then express its new value as `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `stop`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `stop` is not explicitly set or remains False**.
