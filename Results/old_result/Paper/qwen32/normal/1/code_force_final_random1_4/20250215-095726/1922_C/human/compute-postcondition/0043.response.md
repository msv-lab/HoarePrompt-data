To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on some loop's logic.
   - `m`: Greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x` and `y`: Two integers obtained from the input, with `y` being less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Logic and Calculation:**
   - The `d2` dictionary is updated in a loop, but the specific logic of this update isn't provided in the initial state. This means we don't know the exact values stored in `d2` for any keys.
   - The `print` statement computes the difference between `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

3. **Output Analysis:**
   - Since the specific values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and updated based on the loop's logic)**
