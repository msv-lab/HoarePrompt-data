The given code snippet modifies the variable `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by the value of `cur_ss` and then adding the result to `cur`. However, the variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it exists and is initialized to some value before this line of code is executed. Since `cur` is not part of the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value before this operation. We will denote the new value of `cur` after the operation as `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `tmp`, `i`, `cur_ss`, `ss`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either '' or `s[1]`, `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[2]`, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
