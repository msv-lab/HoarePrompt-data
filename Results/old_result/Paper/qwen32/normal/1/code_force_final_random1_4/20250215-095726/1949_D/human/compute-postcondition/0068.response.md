Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', `b[n]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `b[n]` has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
