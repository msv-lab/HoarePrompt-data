Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in `line`; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings with at least one element; `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player entity, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', the corresponding goal list is updated with the position `(i, ind)`.**
