The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. The value of `x` is given as `x_next_next`. The condition for `j` (whether it is increased by 1 or remains unchanged) depends on whether `x` is equal to 1, but since `x` is `x_next_next`, the value of `j` is not affected by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` is `x_next_next`; `i` is `i` + `x_next_next`; `j` remains unchanged**.
