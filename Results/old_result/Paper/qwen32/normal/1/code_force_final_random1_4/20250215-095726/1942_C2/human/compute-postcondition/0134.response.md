Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the third integer read from the input, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`, `c` is `i // 2`, and `y` is less than `c`.**
