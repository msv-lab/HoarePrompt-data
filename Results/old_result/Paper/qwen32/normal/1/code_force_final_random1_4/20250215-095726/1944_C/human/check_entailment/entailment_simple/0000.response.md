### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- To maximize the MEX of `c`, Alice should try to include as many consecutive numbers starting from 0 in `c` as possible.
- Bob, on the other hand, will try to prevent Alice from achieving this by removing elements strategically.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. It then iteratively tries to construct the sequence of numbers starting from 0 by decrementing the counts of these numbers in the `Counter`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
1. **Initialization**: A `Counter` object `nums` is created to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. **Processing**: Starting from `start = 0`, the solution checks if `start` exists in `nums`:
   - If `start` exists, it is added to the set `vis` and its count in `nums` is decremented.
   - Then, the solution checks if `start + 1` exists in `nums`:
     - If `start + 1` exists, its count in `nums` is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
     - If `start + 1` does not exist, the current value of `start + 1` is printed as the MEX of `c` and the function returns.
3. **Termination**: The loop continues until an integer `start` is found that does not exist in `nums`, at which point `start` is printed as the MEX.

#### Correctness:
- The solution correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` by simulating the game between Alice and Bob.
- By using a `Counter` and decrementing counts as elements are "picked" by Alice and Bob, the solution effectively tracks the state of the game.
- The condition to check if `start + 1` exists ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` is correctly identified and printed as the MEX.

Given the above analysis, the solution appears to be correct and efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
