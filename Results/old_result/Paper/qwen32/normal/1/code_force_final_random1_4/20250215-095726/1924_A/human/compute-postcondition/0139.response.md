The given code snippet modifies the value of `cur` by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it. Here's the updated state:

- `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`. Given that `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `1 << cur_ss` shifts the number 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions in binary, effectively calculating 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`.

Therefore, the new value of `cur` is the old value of `cur` plus `2^cur_ss`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cur` equals its previous value plus `2^cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `ans` includes `ss` or remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
