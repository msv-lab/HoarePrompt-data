Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a grid of `n` lines with `m` characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The function processes each grid and returns a result based on the configuration of 'W' and 'B' in the grid.**
