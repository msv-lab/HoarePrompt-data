Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. `cnt_b[a[2m + 1]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, `curr` is increased by 1.**
