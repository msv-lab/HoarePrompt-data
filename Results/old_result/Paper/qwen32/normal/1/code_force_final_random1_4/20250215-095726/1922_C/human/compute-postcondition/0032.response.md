To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 3`. For the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Adjust `i`:** Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 4`.
2. **Adjust other variables:** The variables `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2` do not change their values based on the loop head; they remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
