Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code systematically using the function summary and the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given encoded integer `n`.
- The sum `n` is calculated as the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
- The letters are indexed from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z').
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `n`.
3. Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs a 3-letter word:
   - If `n > 52`, it sets the first letter to `alphabet[n - 53]` and the last two letters to 'zz'.
   - If `52 >= n > 26`, it sets the first letter to 'a', the second letter to `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the third letter to 'z'.
   - If `n <= 26`, it sets the first two letters to 'aa' and the third letter to `alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the provided logic correctly handles all possible values of `n` within the given constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

1. **Case 1: n > 52**
   - For `n > 52`, the formula `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` seems incorrect.
   - The maximum value for `n` is 78, so `n - 53` can be at most 25, which corresponds to 'z'.
   - However, the formula does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `n = 78`, the formula gives 'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz', but the correct answer should be 'rzz'.

2. **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**
   - For `26 < n ≤ 52`, the formula `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` is also incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 52`, the formula gives 'a' + 'y' + 'z' = 'ayz', but the correct answer should be 'czz'.

3. **Case 3: n ≤ 26**
   - For `n ≤ 26`, the formula `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` is incorrect.
   - For example, for `n = 3`, the formula gives 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa', which is correct, but this is a special case and doesn't generalize well.

### Verification Using Function Summary:
The function summary indicates that the function constructs a specific string based on the value of `n`. However, the summary does not specify how the constructed string ensures the lexicographically smallest word. Given the examples and the analysis above, the constructed strings do not always match the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
