To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the logic of the provided code and how it processes each test case.

### Code Analysis:
- The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a grid.
- It then reads `n` lines of `m` characters each, forming a grid `gr`.
- The variable `ans` is initially set to `'YES'`.
- If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`), it checks if all the cells in the first row and the last row are alternating. Similarly, it checks the first and last columns.
- If any of these conditions fail, `ans` is set to `'NO'`.
- Finally, it prints `ans` for each test case.

### Output State After All Iterations:
After processing all `t` test cases, the output state will be a series of `t` lines, each containing either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, based on the conditions described above.

### Final Output State:
The final output state will be a sequence of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case. Each line will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, depending on whether the grid meets the specified conditions.

**Output State: **A sequence of `t` lines, each being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, indicating the result for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after all test cases have been processed, the output will consist of `t` lines, where each line indicates whether the corresponding grid satisfies the given conditions ('YES') or not ('NO').
