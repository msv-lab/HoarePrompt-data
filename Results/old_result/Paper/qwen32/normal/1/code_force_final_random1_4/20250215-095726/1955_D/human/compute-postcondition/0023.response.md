The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decreasing the count of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` is in `b_values`), otherwise `curr` remains 0; `i` is `m`**
