Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `tc` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
