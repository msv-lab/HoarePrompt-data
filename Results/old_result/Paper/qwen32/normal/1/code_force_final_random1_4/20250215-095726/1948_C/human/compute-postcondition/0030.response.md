Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is the next odd number less than `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
