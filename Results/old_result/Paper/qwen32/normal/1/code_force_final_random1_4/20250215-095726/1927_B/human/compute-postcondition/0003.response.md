The provided code snippet initializes a list `alp` containing the lowercase English alphabet letters. However, none of the existing variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `array`) are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet letters.**
