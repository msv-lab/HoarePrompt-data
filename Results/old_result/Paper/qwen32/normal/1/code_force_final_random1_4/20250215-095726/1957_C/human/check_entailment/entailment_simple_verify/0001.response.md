To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the implementation details, especially focusing on the dynamic programming approach and the handling of the board configurations.

### Problem Recap

The task involves determining the number of distinct final configurations of an n x n chessboard after k moves by the player and the corresponding responses by the computer. The key points are:
- Players alternate placing rooks on the board.
- The player places a white rook at (r, c).
- The computer mirrors this move by placing a black rook at (c, r).
- If r == c, the computer skips its turn.
- No two rooks can attack each other (same row or column).
- We need to compute the number of distinct configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis

#### Dynamic Programming Approach

The program uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of ways to fill the board for different sizes. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board:
     - Place a rook in the top-left corner.
     - Place a rook in the top-right corner.
     - Place a rook in the bottom-left corner.
     - Place a rook in the bottom-right corner.
     - However, placing rooks in opposite corners results in the same configuration, so there are effectively 3 distinct configurations.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]) % 1000000007`: This relation considers the number of ways to fill an i x i board by either:
     - Placing a rook in a new row/column and filling the remaining (i-1) x (i-1) board (`dp[i-1]`).
     - Placing rooks in two different rows/columns and filling the remaining (i-2) x (i-2) board (`2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]`).

#### Precomputation

- The function `func_1(n)` computes the values of `dp` up to `n = 300000`. This ensures that the program can handle the maximum board size efficiently.

#### Processing Each Test Case

- For each test case, the program reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
- It reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing the moves.
- It adds both `r` and `c` to a set `invalid` to track rows and columns that are already occupied.
- The number of remaining valid positions is `n - len(invalid)`.
- The result for the test case is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of ways to fill the remaining board.

### Validation Using Annotations

The annotations confirm the state of the program before and after key operations:
- Before the function call `func_1(n)`, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are read correctly.
- After the function call, `dp[n]` holds the precomputed values for the number of ways to fill the board.

### Edge Cases

- The program handles the case where `len(invalid) >= n` by ensuring `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` is used, preventing negative indices.
- The program efficiently handles large inputs due to the precomputation of `dp` values.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem using dynamic programming. It precomputes the number of ways to fill the board for different sizes and efficiently processes each test case by leveraging these precomputed values.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
