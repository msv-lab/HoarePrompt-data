Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n + i - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string; `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 4 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n + i - 3])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus two additional empty strings; `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is `int(data[2*n + 2*q + 5]); `r` is `int(data[idx - 1]); `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. Additionally, if `x` equals 0, `results` has an extra empty string appended to it; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then the conditions inside the if block are met. Otherwise, the conditions inside the else block are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*(q + 1) + 4 + n + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4]) + 1` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n + i - 5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus three additional empty strings; `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)`, the conditions inside the if block are met. Otherwise, the conditions inside the else block are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*(q + 1) + 4 + n + 2 + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n + i - 7])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus five additional empty strings (the last one being 'NO' if the if condition is not met); `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, a new string 'YES' has been appended to `results`. Otherwise, the last element of `results` remains 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
