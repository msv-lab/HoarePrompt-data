The code appends the last element of `smin` to itself. Initially, `smin` is `[0]`. After appending `smin[i]` (which is `smin[0]` or `0`) to `smin`, `smin` becomes `[0, 0]`.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, 0]`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`**.
