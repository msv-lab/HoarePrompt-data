Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly influence the print statement.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `X`:** 
   - `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2. This operation discards any remainder and gives the largest whole number less than or equal to `A / 2`.

2. **Expression `X * C + B`:**
   - First, `X * C` is computed. Since `X` is `A // 2`, this part of the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C`.
   - Then, `B` is added to the result of `X * C`.

### Final Output:
The expression `X * C + B` translates to `(A // 2) * C + B`. Given the initial state, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `A`, `B`, and `C`. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of these variables.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers read from the input)**
