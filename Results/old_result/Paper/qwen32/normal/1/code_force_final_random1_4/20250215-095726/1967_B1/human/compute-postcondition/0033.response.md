The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged except for the precondition that `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
