To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `time`: This variable is incremented by 1 at some point in the code, but its exact value isn't specified in the initial state. We'll denote it as `time`.
   - `GoalName`: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to goal names. Since the exact contents of this dictionary aren't provided, we'll refer to the value associated with `team` as `GoalName[team]`.
   - `team`: This variable is determined based on the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', `team` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.
   - `obj`, `com`, and `el`: These are elements of the `command` list, but their specific values aren't provided in the initial state.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses a formatted string to output two pieces of information:
     - `%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`: This format specifier indicates that the first placeholder (`%d`) will be replaced by an integer (`time`), and the second placeholder (`%s`) will be replaced by a string (`GoalName[team]`).

3. **Output Description:**
   - The integer `time` will be printed as it is.
   - The string `GoalName[team]` will be printed, where `team` is either 0 or 1 based on the first character of `obj`.

Given the information above, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **time GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where time is the current value of the time variable and GoalName[team] is the goal name corresponding to the team identifier)**
