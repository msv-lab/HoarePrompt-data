The code assigns the variable `x` the value of the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` is assigned the value `-1`.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. `n` also remains unchanged. The string `arr` is already defined with all whitespace removed.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**
