### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that it meets the problem requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If so, it returns `(0, 0)` because an odd Manhattan value cannot be achieved with the given constraints.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because it's impossible to achieve a Manhattan value greater than `max_k`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates through the list in reverse, adjusting the list based on the value of `k`.
   - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current list `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to make the final adjustments.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_3` to swap elements and reduce `k`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c-k` in the list `l`.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the `c`-th element from the end with the element at index `c-1`.

5. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l` if a valid permutation was found.
   - It prints "NO" if no valid permutation exists.

6. **Function `func_6`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is zero (indicating an invalid case), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where `k` is odd by returning `(0, 0)` from `func_4`.
  - It also correctly handles cases where `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k`.

- **Generating Permutations:**
  - The algorithm in `func_1` seems to follow a strategy to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
  - The use of `func_2` and `func_3` to adjust the list `l` ensures that the Manhattan value is correctly adjusted.

- **Output:**
  - The function `func_5` correctly prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid one is found.
  - It prints "NO" if no valid permutation exists.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly handle all specified cases and constraints. It efficiently constructs permutations with the desired Manhattan value when possible and correctly identifies cases where it is not possible.

**Correctness: True**
