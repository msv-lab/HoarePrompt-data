Postcondition: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`; `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`; `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`; `m` is `m - 1`; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Regardless of whether `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` holds true or not, the values of `i`, `j`, `p`, `c`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
