You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and then calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0-based). It prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `2n` positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform `n` moves where in each move, we choose two integers `x` and `y`, add `min(x, y)` to our score, and erase `x` and `y`.
- Our goal is to maximize the final score after `n` moves.

### Strategy:
To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that we are adding the smallest possible value to our score in each move, which is beneficial since we want to maximize the sum of these minimum values.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
3. **Scoring**: It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices `0, 2, 4, ...`), and adds these elements to the score.
4. **Output**: It prints the score for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together.
- **Scoring**: By adding every second element from the sorted list, the program effectively adds the smaller of each pair (since the list is sorted).

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Single Pair**: When `n = 1`, the list has two elements. The program correctly adds the smaller of the two.
- **Multiple Pairs**: For larger `n`, the program pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring the maximum possible score.
- **All Identical Numbers**: If all numbers are the same, the program will correctly add the same number `n` times.
- **Mixed Numbers**: The sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are always paired together, maximizing the score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together. It handles all edge cases and works as expected for every potential input scenario.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program sorts the list of numbers and sums up every second element starting from the first, which corresponds to the smallest numbers in each pair, thus maximizing the score as required by the problem description.
