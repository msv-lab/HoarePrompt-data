Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `t - 1`, and for each of the `t` test cases, the program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions provided in the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = t - 1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. The program will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on the relationship between `n` and `m` as defined in the loop's conditions. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the process.
