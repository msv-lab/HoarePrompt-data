The code snippet provided modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` from its current value.

Given the initial state, `b` is initially set to `A[l - 1]`. After executing the code, `b` is updated to `b - A[l - r - 2]`.

Since `l - r - 1 > 0` is given, it implies that `l - r - 2` is also a valid index into the array `A`.

Thus, the new value of `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1; `a` is `B[r]`; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**
