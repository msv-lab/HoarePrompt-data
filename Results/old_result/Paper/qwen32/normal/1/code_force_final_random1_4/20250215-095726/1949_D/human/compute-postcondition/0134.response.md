The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `j - 1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. 

Given the initial state, `xx` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are input strings. `j` is incremented by 1 before this line, so `j - 1` refers to the current position in the strings within `xx`.

After executing the line, `nx` will have the new character appended to it.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` has the character `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it.**
