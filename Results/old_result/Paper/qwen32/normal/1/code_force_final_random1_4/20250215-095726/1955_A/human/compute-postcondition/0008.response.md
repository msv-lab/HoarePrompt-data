Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `X` is calculated as `A // 2`. Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will result in the integer division of `A` by 2, which effectively removes the fractional part (i.e., it rounds down to the nearest whole number).

For example, if `A` is 5, then `X` would be `5 // 2`, which equals 2.

Thus, the value of `X` is determined by the integer division of `A` by 2. All other variables (`t`, `B`, and `C`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`; `A` is an odd integer; `X` is `A // 2`.**
