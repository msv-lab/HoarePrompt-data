You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a new list `res` where each element is determined by subtracting the corresponding element in `a` from a decreasing value starting from `n`. The function then prints the resulting list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a`, where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array up to that point.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to reconstruct the permutation `p` in reverse order. It initializes `mex` to `n` (the maximum possible value for `MEX` at the start) and iterates through the array `a` from the last element to the first. For each element `a_i`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i`. It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - a_i`.

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value for `MEX` initially.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program processes the array `a` from the end to the beginning. This approach is logical because `MEX` values are influenced by all previous elements, and processing in reverse allows us to use the `mex` value effectively.
3. **Calculation of `p_i`**: For each `a_i`, `p_i` is calculated as `mex - a_i`.
4. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p_i`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
5
1 1 -2 1 2

Processing:
i = 4: a[4] = 2, mex = 5 -> p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3, mex = min(5, 3) = 3
i = 3: a[3] = 1, mex = 3 -> p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2, mex = min(3, 2) = 2
i = 2: a[2] = -2, mex = 2 -> p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4, mex = min(2, 4) = 2
i = 1: a[1] = 1, mex = 2 -> p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1, mex = min(2, 1) = 1
i = 0: a[0] = 1, mex = 1 -> p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0, mex = min(1, 0) = 0

Result: p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]
```

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` by iterating in reverse and updating the `mex` value appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
