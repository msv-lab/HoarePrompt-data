Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` including the newly added `i`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
