The given code modifies the value of `sm` based on its current value and the value of `k`. Specifically, `sm` is updated to `2 ** k * sm - sm`.

Let's break down the transformation:
- `2 ** k` computes 2 raised to the power of `k`.
- This result is then multiplied by the current value of `sm`.
- Finally, the original value of `sm` is subtracted from this product.

This can be rewritten as:
\[ \text{new\_sm} = (2^k - 1) \times \text{sm} \]

Thus, the new value of `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

The variable `smin` remains unchanged because it is not referenced or modified in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` and `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.**
