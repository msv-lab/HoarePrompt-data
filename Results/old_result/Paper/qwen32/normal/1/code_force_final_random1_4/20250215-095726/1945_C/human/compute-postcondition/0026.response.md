To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` since the loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates numbers from `0` to `n - 2`).

2. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
   - Given that the loop condition is `i < n - 1`, the next valid value for `i` would be `i + 1` from the previous iteration.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `lst`, `mini`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Thus, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is `(zero * 100) // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`**
