To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head specifies that `i` iterates from `n - 2` down to `1`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.
- The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`, which means `i` should be `n - 3`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's iteration logic.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 2. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
