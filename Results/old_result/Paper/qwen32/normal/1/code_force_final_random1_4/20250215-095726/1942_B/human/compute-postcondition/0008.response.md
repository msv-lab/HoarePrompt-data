Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`; `mex` is `n - ar[i]` and `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
