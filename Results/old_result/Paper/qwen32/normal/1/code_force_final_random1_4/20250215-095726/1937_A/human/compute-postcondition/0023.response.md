The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. This means the value of `n` will change based on the user's input, but the values of `t`, `n_cases`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, and `i` is 1. The value of `n` could initially be either 1 or `log2(n_cases)`, but after the input operation, `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the user.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, and `n` is the integer provided by the user.**
