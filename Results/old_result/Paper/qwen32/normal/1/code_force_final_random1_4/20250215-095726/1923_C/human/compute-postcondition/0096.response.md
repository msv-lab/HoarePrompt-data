Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`m`**: It is mentioned as `m - 2`, but there is no explicit value given for `m` before this operation. This means `m` was initially some value, and then it was decremented by 2. However, the value of `m` itself is not relevant to the `print` statement.
2. **`a` and `b`**: These are described as "new integers read from the input". This means their values depend on the user input or some external source, and they are not explicitly provided in the initial state.
3. **`i`**: It is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. Here, `c` is presumably a list, and `i` is the difference between the `b`-th element and the `(a-1)`-th element of `c`. However, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and the contents of `c` are not provided.
4. **`s`**: It is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Similarly, `p` is presumably a list, and `s` is the difference between the `b`-th element and the `(a-1)`-th element of `p`. Again, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and the contents of `p` are not provided.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `s` are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
