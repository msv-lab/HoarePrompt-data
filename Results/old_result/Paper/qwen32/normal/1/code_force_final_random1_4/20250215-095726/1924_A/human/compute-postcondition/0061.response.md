The code snippet sets the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string read from the input, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state remains as described. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
