### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - It also reads two lists: `a` (costs to swap with people ahead) and `b` (costs to pass through people ahead).

2. **Adjustments for Zero-Indexing**:
   - The program adjusts `n` and `m` to zero-based indexing by subtracting 1 from both.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes `total` to 0 (total cost incurred so far) and `best` to a very large number (10^12) representing the minimum cost found so far.
   - It iterates from the last person in the queue (`na_frente`) to the first person (`v = 0`).
     - If the current position `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` (Kirill's target position):
       - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` is less than the current `best`. If so, it updates `best`.
       - It adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If the current position `v` is greater than `pos_final`:
       - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, it prints the value of `best`, which represents the minimum cost for Kirill to reach his target position.

### Analysis:

- **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
  - The logic correctly considers the cost of swapping and passing through people.
  - It ensures that the cost to reach the target position is minimized by always choosing the cheaper option between swapping and passing through.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `m == n`, Kirill can stay at the end of the queue, and the cost will be the sum of the minimum costs to pass through all people.
  - If `m == 1`, Kirill must reach the front of the queue, and the cost will be the minimum cost to swap with the person at the front.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.
  - It efficiently computes the minimum cost using a single pass through the list of people.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

**Correctness: True**
