Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - He currently has `n` problems with specific difficulty levels.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can organize all `m` rounds.

2. **Program Overview:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level in the existing problems.
   - It then computes how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems per level.
   - Finally, it sums up the required additional problems across all difficulty levels and outputs the result.

3. **Detailed Breakdown of the Code:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (for 'A' to 'G') to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - It iterates over the string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems and updates the frequency array accordingly.
   - It calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. Specifically, for each difficulty level, it computes `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the current frequency of that difficulty level. This ensures that if the current frequency is already sufficient (`f >= m`), no additional problems are counted for that level.
   - It appends the total number of missing problems to the `results` list.
   - The function returns the `results` list, which contains the number of additional problems needed for each test case.

4. **Verification Against Example:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - **Test Case 1:** `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
       - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2
       - Missing: A=1, F=1, G=0, E=0, C=0, D=0, B=0
       - Total Missing: 2
     - **Test Case 2:** `n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
       - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2
       - Missing: A=2, F=2, G=0, E=0, C=1, D=0, B=0
       - Total Missing: 5
     - **Test Case 3:** `n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`
       - Frequencies: B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2
       - Missing: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=0, G=0
       - Total Missing: 1

   - The program's output matches the expected results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case based on the given problem description and example.

**Correctness: True**
