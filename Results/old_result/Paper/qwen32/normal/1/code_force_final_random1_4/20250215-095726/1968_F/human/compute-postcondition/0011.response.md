Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; the first element of `data` is the integer `t`; the remaining elements are the integers `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` and the queries, all as strings; `idx` is 3; `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a dictionary with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that a new dictionary `mp` has been created with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
