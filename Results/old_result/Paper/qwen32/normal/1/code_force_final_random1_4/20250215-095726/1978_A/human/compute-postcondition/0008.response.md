To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the components based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. This variable `t` represents the number of test cases but is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is the new input integer, which represents the length of the list `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

Let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. `nums[:-1]` refers to all elements of the list `nums` except the last one.
2. `max(nums[:-1])` computes the maximum value among all elements of `nums` except the last one.
3. `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `nums`.
4. The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements of `nums` to the last element of `nums`.

Thus, the output will be the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements of `nums` and the last element of `nums`.

Given the lack of specific values for `nums`, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements of `nums` and the last element of `nums` (where `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the latest input)**
