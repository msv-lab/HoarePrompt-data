Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The core logic for calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is missing. Instead, the program contains several utility functions (`func_1` through `func_16`) that do not directly address the problem at hand.

Specifically, the function `func_15` seems to be attempting to calculate something related to the problem, but it does not correctly implement the required logic. Let's analyze why this function is incorrect:

### Analysis of `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i:` is not clearly related to the problem's requirement.
- The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correspond to checking whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The final result `ans - 1` does not make sense in the context of the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a more appropriate implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        m = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly iterates over all pairs (a, b) and checks the condition specified in the problem statement. Since the original program does not contain this logic, it is incorrect.
