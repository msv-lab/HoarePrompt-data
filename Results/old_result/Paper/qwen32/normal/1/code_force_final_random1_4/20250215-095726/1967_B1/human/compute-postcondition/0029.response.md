Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 4; `count` is 5; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2 + int(g / 4) + 1`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3` if `int(n / 4) >= 3`, otherwise `g` is `int(n / 4)`**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables retain their initial values.
