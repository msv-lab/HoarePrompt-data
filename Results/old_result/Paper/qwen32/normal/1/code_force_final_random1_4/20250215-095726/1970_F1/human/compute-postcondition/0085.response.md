To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `ind`.

Given the loop:
```python
for ind in range(len(line)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `ind` was 0.
- The loop iterates over the indices of the `line` list.

Since the loop increments `ind` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `ind` should be 1.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because there are no other variables in the loop head besides `ind`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(i, ind)` for all `ind` where `line[ind]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in `line`; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `ind` is 1; `i` is the next integer after the previous value of `i` (i.e., `i + 1`). Additionally, if `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[0]]` is now `(i, 0)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)`**
