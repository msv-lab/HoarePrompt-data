The provided code snippet is a function definition without any implementation details. Since there is no actual code to execute, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the same initial conditions.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
