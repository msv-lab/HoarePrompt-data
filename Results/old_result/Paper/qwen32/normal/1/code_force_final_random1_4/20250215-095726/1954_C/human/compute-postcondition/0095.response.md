The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements; `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `b[1]` is equal to `a[1]`, and `b[2]` is equal to `a[2]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `new[2]` is `a[2]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2[1]` is `a[1]`, and `new2[2]` is `a[2]`; `i` is 3**
