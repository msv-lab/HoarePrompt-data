Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
