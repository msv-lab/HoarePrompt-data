The code assigns the second element of the list `feat` to the variable `f`. Given that `n` is the first element of `feat`, the only change is the introduction of the variable `f` which now holds the value of the second element of `feat`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `feat` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is the first element of `feat`; `f` is the second element of `feat`.**
