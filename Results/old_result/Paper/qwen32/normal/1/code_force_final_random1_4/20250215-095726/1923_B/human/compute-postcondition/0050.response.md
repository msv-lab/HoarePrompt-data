The given code snippet modifies the list `a` by subtracting `delta` from the element at the index specified by `sorted_indices[pos]`. Given that `delta` is 0, the subtraction operation does not change the value of the element in the list `a`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` translates to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= 0`, which means no change to the value at the specified index in `a`.
- Since `delta` is 0, the list `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `rest` must be non-zero, `delta = 0`, `pos` must be less than 3**.
