Postcondition: **`x` is the new input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[n]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[n]` is incremented by 1. `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n`.**
