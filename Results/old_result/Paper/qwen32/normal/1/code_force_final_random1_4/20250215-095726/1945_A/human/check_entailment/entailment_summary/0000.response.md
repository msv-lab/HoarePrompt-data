### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if it correctly computes the minimum number of tents required.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each needs a tent by themselves.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each needs a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Can be placed in any type of tent.

The goal is to find the minimum number of tents such that:
- All introverts have their own tents.
- All extroverts are in tents with exactly two others.
- Universals can fill in any remaining spots.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided code does the following for each test case:
1. Reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. Combines `b` and `c` into a single variable `b` (i.e., `b += c`). This step implies treating universals as potential candidates to fill in for extroverts who need pairs.
3. Calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts by integer division `b // 3` (since each extrovert needs a tent with two others).
4. Checks if there are enough universals (`c`) to fill any leftover spots after forming groups of three with extroverts (`b % 3`).
5. Prints the total number of tents required (`a + (b // 3)`) if there are enough universals to cover the leftovers; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

However, there is a logical flaw in this approach. Specifically:
- The line `print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])` has a syntax error due to the double negative (`- -b // 3`), which should be `a + b // 3`.
- More importantly, the logic does not correctly account for the fact that universals can be used to form additional pairs with extroverts or to fill single-person tents for introverts.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Allocate tents for introverts first (`a` tents).
2. Try to form groups of three with extroverts and universals.
3. Check if there are enough universals to fill any leftover spots after forming groups of three with extroverts.
4. Ensure that no extroverts are left without forming a group of three.

The corrected logic should look something like this:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        # Tents for introverts
        tents = a
        # Remaining extroverts after forming groups of three
        remaining_extroverts = b % 3
        # Number of full groups of three extroverts
        full_groups = b // 3
        # Add tents for full groups of extroverts
        tents += full_groups
        # If there are remaining extroverts, we need at least one more tent
        if remaining_extroverts > 0:
            # Check if we have enough universals to fill the remaining spots
            if c >= 3 - remaining_extroverts:
                # Use universals to fill the remaining spots
                c -= 3 - remaining_extroverts
                tents += 1
            else:
                # Not enough universals to fill the remaining spots
                print(-1)
                continue
        # Any remaining universals can be placed in single-person tents
        tents += c // 3
        if c % 3 != 0:
            tents += 1
        print(tents)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
