Output State: **a and b are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; t is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
This means that the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and a new variable `t` is introduced, which holds the integer value of the number of test cases entered by the user.
