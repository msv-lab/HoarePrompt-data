n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited and coef are lists of length n initialized with None, and tot and bipartite are variables used within the function.
