The value of `power` is incremented by 1. Initially, `power` is 2, so after the operation, `power` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n_cases` is equal to `t`; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; `power` is 3**.
