The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of the new tuple to the `ops` list.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
