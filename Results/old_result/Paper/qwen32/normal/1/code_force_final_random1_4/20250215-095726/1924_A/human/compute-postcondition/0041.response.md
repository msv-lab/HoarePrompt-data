The code snippet assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the current value of `i` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, `tmp` will be assigned the character `'a'`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` remains a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `cnt` remains the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, and `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` remains 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set.
- `ans` remains the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters.
- `tmp` is now `'a'`.
- `i` remains 0.
- The condition `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` remains true.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `tmp` is `'a'`, `i` is 0, and `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true.**
