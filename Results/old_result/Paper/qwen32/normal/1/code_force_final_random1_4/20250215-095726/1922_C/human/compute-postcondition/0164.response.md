To determine the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. For keys `k` from 3 to `n`, `d1[k]` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
- `d2` is another `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. For keys `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `d2[i]` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` as described in the loop.
- `m` is a new integer obtained from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- `x` and `y` are a pair of integers obtained from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y > x`; otherwise, `y \leq x`.

### Calculation of `d1`:
The `d1` dictionary is constructed such that for each key `k` from 3 to `n`, `d1[k]` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. Specifically, it seems like `d1[k]` would store some cumulative or aggregated value related to these differences, but without the exact formula, we can only describe it generally.

### Calculation of `d1[y] - d1[x]`:
Given that `d1` stores some values based on differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be the difference between the values stored at keys `y` and `x` in `d1`. Since the exact values of `d1[k]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these keys.

### Output Description:
The output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement will be the difference between the values stored in `d1` at keys `y` and `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are the values in the defaultdict d1 at keys y and x respectively, based on the differences between consecutive elements of the list l)**
