### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Reading Input**: The function reads the dimensions of the field (`N` and `M`), initializes the grid, and maps the positions of all entities on the field.
- **Processing Commands**: For each command, it updates the positions of players and the Quaffle, handles catching and throwing the Quaffle, and checks if a goal is scored.
- **Scoring**: When a player places the Quaffle in a goal, the function updates the score accordingly and prints the event.
- **Final Output**: After processing all commands, the function prints the final score of the game.

#### Function 2: `goalIn(pos)`
- **Purpose**: This function checks if a given position `pos` corresponds to a goal.
- **Implementation**: It checks if `pos` is in the list of red goals (`goal[0]`) or blue goals (`goal[1]`) and returns the corresponding team index (0 for red, 1 for blue) or -1 if `pos` is not a goal.

#### Function 3: `isPlayer(el)`
- **Purpose**: This function determines if a given entity `el` is a player.
- **Implementation**: It checks if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Goals**:
   - The function `func_1()` uses `goalIn(pos)` to determine if a goal is scored, but `goalIn(pos)` is not defined within the scope of `func_1()`. This would lead to a `NameError`.
   - The `goal` variable used in `goalIn(pos)` is not accessible within `func_1()` because it is defined locally within `func_1()`.

2. **Incorrect Team Indexing**:
   - The `goalIn(pos)` function uses `goal[0]` for red goals and `goal[1]` for blue goals, but the problem statement specifies that the blue team tries to put the ball in a red goal (RG) and vice versa. Therefore, the indexing should be reversed.

3. **Missing Global Variables**:
   - The `goal`, `elements`, and `allPlayers` variables are defined within `func_1()` but are accessed in `goalIn(pos)`. These variables need to be defined globally or passed as arguments to `goalIn(pos)`.

4. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The function `func_1()` checks if a goal is scored by calling `goalIn(pos)`, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. The logic should check if the goal belongs to the opposing team.

5. **Incorrect Movement Handling**:
   - The movement handling in `func_1()` does not account for boundaries or invalid moves, although the problem states that all actions are guaranteed to be valid.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the scope and accessibility problems with variables and the incorrect handling of goal scoring, the program as provided is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
