The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables directly. Therefore, none of the variables `i`, `bd`, `v`, `q`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, or `l` will be modified by this statement.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is the integer value from user input, `s` is the new insertion point of `ql` in `a` found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `l` is 2.**

In natural language: The values of all variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not alter any of the variables; it simply moves to the next iteration of the loop.
