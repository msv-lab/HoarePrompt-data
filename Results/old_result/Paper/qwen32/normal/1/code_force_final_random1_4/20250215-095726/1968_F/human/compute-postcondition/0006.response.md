The code assigns the integer value of the second element in the `data` list (which is at index 1) to the variable `n`. This means `n` now holds the integer value of what was previously the string `data[1]`.

The other variables (`data`, `idx`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; the first element of `data` is the integer `t`; the remaining elements are the integers `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` and the queries, all as strings; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
