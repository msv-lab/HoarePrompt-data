The code snippet assigns the length of list `B` to the variable `r`. Since `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in the string `s`, the length of `B` is the count of '<' characters in `s`.

Given that `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`, the length of `B` (and thus `r`) is the same as the number of elements in `idx_B`.

Therefore, `r` is now equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.**
