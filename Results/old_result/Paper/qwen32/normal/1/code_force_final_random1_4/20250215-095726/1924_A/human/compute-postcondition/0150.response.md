The given Python code snippet only initializes a new variable `tmp` with an empty string. None of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `cur`, `cnt`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is i + len(s), `cur` is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete), `cnt` is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively, and `cnt` is less than n; `tmp` is an empty string.**
