Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` can be split into two equal parts that are not equal to the other number. If such a condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
