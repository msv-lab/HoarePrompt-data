Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of a string, an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` integers, each representing the missing value for the corresponding test case. If `t` is 0, the `results` list is empty.**
