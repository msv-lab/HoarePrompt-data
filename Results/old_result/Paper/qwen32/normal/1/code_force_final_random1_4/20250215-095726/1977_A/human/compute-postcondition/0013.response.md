The initial state provides several conditions about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement in the given code snippet. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers with specific constraints (`n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, `m` is even, and `n` is even).

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Output: **Yes**
