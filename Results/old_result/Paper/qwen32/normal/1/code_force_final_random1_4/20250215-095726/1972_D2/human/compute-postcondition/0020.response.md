To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 4 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `cnt` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)

Currently, `x * x` is `2 * 2` which equals 4, and 4 is less than or equal to `n` (which is 5). Therefore, the loop can still execute one more time with the current values.

Since the loop can certainly execute one more time with the current values of `n` and `x`, we don't need to adjust any of these variables.

State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 2, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 0**
