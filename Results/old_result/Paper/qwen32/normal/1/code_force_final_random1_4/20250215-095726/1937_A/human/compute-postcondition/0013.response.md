Output State: **`power` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `t` is greater than 4, `n_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables (`n`, `t`, and `n_cases`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
