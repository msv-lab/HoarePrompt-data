To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the given information about its state after the first three iterations.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```
This loop will execute `func_1()` exactly `t` times, where `t` is the integer value provided by the user input and satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution. The only change is the number of times `func_1()` is called.

Since the loop runs `t` times and `t` is not modified within the loop, after all iterations are complete, the value of `t` will still be the same as it was initially.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is simply that `t` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` will still hold the same integer value that was provided by the user, which is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
