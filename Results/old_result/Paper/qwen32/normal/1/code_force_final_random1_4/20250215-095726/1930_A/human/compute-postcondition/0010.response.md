To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop works and how many times it will run.

The loop runs with the following parameters:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    score += l[i]
```
This means the loop starts at `i = 0` and increments `i` by 2 each time until `i` reaches `2 * n`. Therefore, the loop will execute `n` times (since `2 * n / 2 = n`).

Given the initial state and the way the loop updates the `score`, we can infer the final state as follows:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The list `l` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `score` accumulates the sum of every second element in the list `l` starting from the first element (`l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*(n-1)]`).

After the loop completes all `n` iterations, the `score` will be the sum of the elements at even indices of the list `l`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices of `l` (i.e., `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*(n-1)]`).**

In simpler terms, the `score` will be the sum of the first, third, fifth, ..., (2n-1)th elements of the list `l`.
