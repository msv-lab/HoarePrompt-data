### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - For each round, Vlad needs exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - Given `m` rounds, Vlad needs `m` problems of each difficulty level.
   - The program must determine how many additional problems Vlad needs to create to meet this requirement.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (representing the counts of problems for difficulties 'A' to 'G').
   - It then iterates over the string `a` to populate the `freq` array.
   - The calculation `sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))` computes the total number of additional problems needed across all difficulty levels. This is done by checking how many more problems are needed for each level (`m - f`) and summing these values, ensuring that the count does not go negative (`max(0, m - f)`).

3. **Verification Against Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2
     - Missing: A=1, F=1, G=1 (but G already has 2, so only A and F are needed)
     - Total missing: 2
   - **Test Case 2:** `n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2
     - Missing: A=2, B=0, C=1, D=0, E=0, F=2, G=0
     - Total missing: 5
   - **Test Case 3:** `n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2
     - Missing: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=0, G=0
     - Total missing: 1

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided logic and example outputs.

### Correctness: **True**
