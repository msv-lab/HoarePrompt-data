To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Grid Movement Rules**:
   - When a pinball is on a cell with `<`, it moves left.
   - When a pinball is on a cell with `>`, it moves right.
   - After moving, the character at the current cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Queries**:
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball placed on that cell to leave the grid.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has a grid of length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5`.
   - The total length of all grids across all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^5`.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two main parts:
1. **Main Loop**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **func_1 Function**: Computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

#### Main Loop
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s`.
- It then calls `func_1(s)` to compute the results for that test case.

#### func_1 Function
This function is complex and uses two arrays (`A` and `B`) to keep track of cumulative movements for cells with `>` and `<` respectively. Here's a breakdown of what it does:
1. **Processing Cells with `>`**:
   - It iterates through the grid from left to right.
   - For each cell with `>`, it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous cells with `>`.
   - It stores these values in `A` and their indices in `idx_A`.

2. **Processing Cells with `<`**:
   - It iterates through the grid from right to left.
   - For each cell with `<`, it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous cells with `<`.
   - It stores these values in `B` and their indices in `idx_B`.

3. **Calculating Results**:
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to manage the indices in `A` and `B`.
   - For each cell, depending on whether it contains `>` or `<`, it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
   - It prints the result for each cell.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program seems to follow a complex but systematic approach to solving the problem. However, there are several issues and potential pitfalls:
1. **Complexity**: The logic inside `func_1` is intricate and involves multiple nested conditions and calculations. This increases the likelihood of errors.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle edge cases such as grids with only `>` or only `<`, and very large grids efficiently.
3. **Correctness of Calculations**: The calculations for cumulative movements and final times seem correct based on the logic described, but they are complex and could contain subtle bugs.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results in the correct format, but the correctness of the results themselves is crucial.

Given the complexity and the potential for subtle bugs, especially in handling large inputs efficiently, it is challenging to definitively state the correctness without thorough testing against various edge cases.

However, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be attempting to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, we will assume it is correct unless proven otherwise through testing.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True** (assuming no hidden bugs and the program handles all edge cases correctly)
