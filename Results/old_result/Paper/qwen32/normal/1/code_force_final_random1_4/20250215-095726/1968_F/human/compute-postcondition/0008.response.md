Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; the first element of `data` is the integer `t`; the remaining elements are the integers `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` and the queries, all as strings; `idx` is 3; `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `idx` has been incremented by 2, changing its value from 1 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
