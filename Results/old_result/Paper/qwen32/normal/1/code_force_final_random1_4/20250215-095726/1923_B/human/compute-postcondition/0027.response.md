Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta` unless `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was initially 0. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters. `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second such that `k > 2 * delta`. `n` is the length of the list `a` and is greater than 0. `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`. `distance` is 0. `pos` is either 0, 1, or 2. `rest` is `k - 3 * delta`. `delta` is `min(k - 2 * delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` unless `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was initially 0, in which case `pos` is updated to be either 1, 2, or 3 and `delta` is recalculated as `min(k - 2 * delta, a[sorted_indices[pos-1]])`.**
