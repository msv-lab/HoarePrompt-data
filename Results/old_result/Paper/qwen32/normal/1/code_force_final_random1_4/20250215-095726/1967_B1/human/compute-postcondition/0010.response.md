Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables.**
