Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis:

The program is supposed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the total points are even. If not, it returns `-1` because points are awarded in pairs (2 for a win, 1+1 for a draw).
2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches is calculated by dividing the total points by 2.
3. **Constraints Check**: The program checks if the total matches exceed 3 (since there are only 3 players, the maximum number of unique matches is 3) and if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total matches.
4. **Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If this value is negative, it returns `-1`; otherwise, it divides this value by 2 to get the number of draws.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Total Matches Constraint**: The condition `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. The maximum number of matches among 3 players is not limited to 3; it can be more depending on how many games they played. For example, if all three players played against each other multiple times, the total number of matches can be greater than 3.
- **Incorrect Draws Calculation Formula**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` seems incorrect and does not correctly account for all possible scenarios of wins and draws.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 2`, `p3 = 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (This can be achieved with 2 wins for player 3 and 2 draws among players 1 and 2)
- Actual Output: The program will likely output `-1` due to the incorrect constraints and formula.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly limits the total number of matches to 3 and uses an incorrect formula to calculate the number of draws, leading to incorrect results for certain valid inputs.
