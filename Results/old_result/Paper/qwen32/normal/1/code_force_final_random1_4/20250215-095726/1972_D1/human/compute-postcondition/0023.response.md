Functionality: **The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` initialized to 0, an integer `da` which is a key present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank`. The function returns `1` if a certain condition is met (Case_1). Otherwise, it returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from recursive calls to `func_12` for each element `di` in the list `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0` (Case_2).**
