Postcondition: **`mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'; `zero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**
