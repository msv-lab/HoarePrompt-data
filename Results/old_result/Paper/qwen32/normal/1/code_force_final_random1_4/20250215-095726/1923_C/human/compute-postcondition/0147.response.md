To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. This represents the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a - 1` in the list `c`.
- `j` is the count of `1`s in the list `l`.
- `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`.
- `m` is incremented by `1` (`m = m + 1`).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. This represents the sum of elements in the sublist of `l` from index `a - 1` to `b`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `i`, `j`, `p`, `c`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
