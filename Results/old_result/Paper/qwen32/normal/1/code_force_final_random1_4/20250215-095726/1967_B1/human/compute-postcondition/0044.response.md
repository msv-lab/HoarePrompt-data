Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + n // 4`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
