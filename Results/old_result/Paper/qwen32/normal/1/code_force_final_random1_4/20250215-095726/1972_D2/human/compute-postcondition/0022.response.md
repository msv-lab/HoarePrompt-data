To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop header:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is 0

Let's evaluate the conditions with these values:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the given values: `(2 + 1) * 2 <= 5`
   - Simplifying: `3 * 2 <= 5`
   - Result: `6 <= 5` which is **False**

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the given values: `(2 + 1) * 1 <= 20`
   - Simplifying: `3 * 1 <= 20`
   - Result: `3 <= 20` which is **True**

Since the first condition is `False`, the entire loop condition is `False`, and the loop will not execute with the current values.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust either `x`, `y`, `n`, or `m` such that both conditions become `True`.

Let's try adjusting `x` and `y` to find suitable values:

- Let's set `x` to 1 and `y` to 1:
  - `(1 + 1) * 1 <= 5` evaluates to `2 * 1 <= 5` which is `2 <= 5` (True)
  - `(1 + 1) * 1 <= 20` evaluates to `2 * 1 <= 20` which is `2 <= 20` (True)

Both conditions are now `True`, so the loop will execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 0**
