Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq n \leq 26\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 26\).
- `m` is an integer with \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is updated to `i + len(s)`.
- `cur` is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete).
- `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were seen consecutively.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('NO')` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `cur`, `cnt`). The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the `print` function.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
