Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, and `x` is a string from user input. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` and `a[j]` are each incremented by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each incremented by 1.**
