Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variable `t`:** It is an integer with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can take any integer value within this range.
2. **Variables `a` and `b`:** These are integers that are read from the input. Their specific values are not provided, but they are known to be integers.
3. **Variable `i`:** This variable is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, nor is the context of the loop or iterations.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement directly outputs the string `'no'`. 
- None of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i` are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
Based on the analysis, the print statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
