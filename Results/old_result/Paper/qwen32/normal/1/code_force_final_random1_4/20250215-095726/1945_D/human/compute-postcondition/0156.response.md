The code appends the integer value of `y` to the list `a_values`. Given that `a_values` initially contains two elements, both equal to `int(y)`, after the execution of the code, `a_values` will contain three elements: the original two `int(y)` values followed by another `int(y)`.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y), int(y), int(y)]`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `y` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `y`**.
