Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an input integer; `custos` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custo` is the sum of the minimum costs calculated by the loop, and `custos` is a list of the values added to `custo` during the iterations, including the current value of `custo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custo` is the sum of selected values from `a_values` and `b_values` based on the condition `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` for `y` ranging from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, with additional adjustments based on the if-else condition until `y` reaches 1; `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, including the newly appended value; `i` is incremented by `num_fila - max_p`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custo` is 140, `custos` is [50, 90, 120, 140], `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55], `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
