Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The function does not utilize any additional parameters related to moves (r_i, c_i) or the number of moves (k) as described in the parameter constraints for the entire problem context. Based on the given output description, the functionality of `func_1` is not fully specified, but it processes the integer `n` and returns some output, which is not detailed in the provided output conditions.**
