The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the ASCII value of the character 'a', adds the current value of `i` to it, and converts the resulting ASCII value back to a character. Given that `i` is initially 2, the calculation proceeds as follows:

- `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97.
- Adding `i` (which is 2) to 97 results in 99.
- `chr(99)` converts the ASCII value 99 back to the character 'c'.

Thus, `tmp` is assigned the value 'c'.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'c'; `i` is 2; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.**
