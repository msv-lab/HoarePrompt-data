Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n and k are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, cnt is the number of times all k characters were seen in any order within the string s, cur is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of k characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, ans is the last character ss that completed a set of k characters, and cnt is greater than or equal to n.**
