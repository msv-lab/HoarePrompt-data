### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The sum of the scores `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3` must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
   - If `total_points` is odd, it means the scores cannot be achieved through any combination of games, so the program correctly appends `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - Since each game contributes 2 points, the total number of matches played is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - If `total_matchs` exceeds 3, it's impossible because there are only 3 players, and each player can play a maximum of 3 games (one against each other player twice). Hence, appending `-1` is correct.
   - Additionally, if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`, itâ€™s also impossible because the highest score cannot exceed the total number of games played. Appending `-1` is correct.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
     - This formula attempts to account for the points awarded to the top scorer (`p3`) and the middle scorer (`p2`), assuming they won some games against the lowest scorer (`p1`).
     - If `egalites` is negative, it indicates an inconsistency in the scores, and appending `-1` is correct.
     - Otherwise, the number of draws is calculated as `egalites // 2`.

### Testing the Program with Given Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case (0, 0, 0):**
   - `total_points = 0`, which is even.
   - `total_matchs = 0`, which is not greater than 3.
   - `p3 = 0`, which is not greater than `total_matchs`.
   - `egalites = 0 - 2*(0-0) - 2*(0-0) = 0`.
   - `egalites // 2 = 0`.
   - Output: `0` (Correct).

2. **Test Case (0, 1, 1):**
   - `total_points = 2`, which is even.
   - `total_matchs = 1`, which is not greater than 3.
   - `p3 = 1`, which is not greater than `total_matchs`.
   - `egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) - 2*(1-0) = 0`.
   - `egalites // 2 = 0`.
   - However, this test case should have 1 draw, indicating a mistake in the formula.
   
3. **Test Case (0, 2, 3):**
   - `total_points = 5`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

4. **Test Case (3, 3, 3):**
   - `total_points = 9`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

5. **Test Case (3, 4, 5):**
   - `total_points = 12`, which is even.
   - `total_matchs = 6`, which is not greater than 3.
   - `p3 = 5`, which is not greater than `total_matchs`.
   - `egalites = 12 - 2*(5-4) - 2*(5-3) = 4`.
   - `egalites // 2 = 2`.
   - Output: `6` (Incorrect, should be `6` but needs verification).

6. **Test Case (1, 1, 10):**
   - `total_points = 12`, which is even.
   - `total_matchs = 6`, which is not greater than 3.
   - `p3 = 10`, which is greater than `total_matchs`.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
There seems to be an issue with the formula used to calculate the number of draws, especially for the test case `(0, 1, 1)`. The formula does not correctly compute the number of draws in all scenarios.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
