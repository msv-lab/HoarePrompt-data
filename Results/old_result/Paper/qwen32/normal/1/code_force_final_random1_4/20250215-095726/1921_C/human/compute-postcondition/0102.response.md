Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 2. If `i` were 0 (which it is not in this case), the behavior would depend on `arr[0] < b / a`; however, since `i` is 2, the behavior depends on `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`. If `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`, then `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.**
