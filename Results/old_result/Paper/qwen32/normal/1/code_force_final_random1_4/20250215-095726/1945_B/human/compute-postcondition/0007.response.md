Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Variables and Their Values**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, but it does not affect the calculation in the `print` statement.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

2. **Condition**:
   - Either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or at least one of `a` or `b` is equal to 1.

3. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to evaluate is `mn // a + mn // b`.

4. **Steps to Calculate the Output**:
   - First, determine the value of `mn` which is `min(a, b) + m`.
   - Then, compute `mn // a` which is the integer division of `mn` by `a`.
   - Compute `mn // b` which is the integer division of `mn` by `b`.
   - Finally, add the results of these two divisions.

5. **Description of the Output**:
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

Given the above steps, the output of the `print` statement can be described as follows:

Output: **mn // a + mn // b (where mn is min(a, b) + m, a and b are integers, and m is an integer such that either m is not divisible by a, or m is not divisible by b, or at least one of a or b is equal to 1)**
