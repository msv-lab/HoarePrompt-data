The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- Specific conditions are defined based on the relationship between `n` and `m`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` will be updated to the values read from the input.
- `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
