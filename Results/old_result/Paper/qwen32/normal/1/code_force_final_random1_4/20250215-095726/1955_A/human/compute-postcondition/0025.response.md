Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means it is the integer division of `A` by 2.
- `i` is defined as `k + 1`, but `k` is not mentioned anywhere in the given initial state, so we can ignore this variable for the purpose of determining the output of the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Analysis:
- `X` is `A // 2`, meaning `X` is the integer part of `A` divided by 2.
- `C` is an integer read from the input.
- `B` is an integer read from the input.
- The expression `X * C + B` computes the product of `X` and `C`, then adds `B` to the result.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Given that `A`, `B`, and `C` are not explicitly provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of these variables.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers read from the input)**
