The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'No'`. The initial state describes various conditions related to the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
