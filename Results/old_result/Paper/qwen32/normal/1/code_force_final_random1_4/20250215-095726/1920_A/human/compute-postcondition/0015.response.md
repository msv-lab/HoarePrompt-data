Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1, `num` is an empty list, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`.**
