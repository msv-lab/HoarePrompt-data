The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Yes'` to the console. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Based on the given information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
