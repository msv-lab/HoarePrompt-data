Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the newly input string of length `n`. If at the current index `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` and `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the control continues without breaking.**
