The given code snippet only includes the line `current_year = next_year`. This means that the value of `current_year` is being updated to the value of `next_year`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the value of `current_year` was previously set to `next_year`. After executing the line `current_year = next_year`, the value of `current_year` remains the same as `next_year`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing one element which is the LCM of the first tuple's list `a`; `current_year` is `next_year`; `next_year` is updated to `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, otherwise `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`; `n` is the first element of `test`; `a` is the second element of `test` and must contain at least one element; `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.**
