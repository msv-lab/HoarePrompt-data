The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list. Since `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and `results` initially contains two elements that are also the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, after appending `winner`, `results` will contain three elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing three elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.**
