Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `3*(p1 + p2 - p3)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `-1` is appended to `resultats`. Otherwise, `resultats` includes the new value `egalites // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `-1` is appended to `resultats` regardless of the value of `egalites`.**
