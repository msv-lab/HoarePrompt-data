The code snippet provided resets the list `gr` to an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `tc`, `ans`, and `impossible`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is an empty list, `tc` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged.**
