Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. It then processes each of these `t` test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it implicitly returns the results of processing the test cases through the operations performed within `func_1()`.**
