Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `ans` is the final value after all iterations (if applicable). If the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. If the difference is not 2, `ans` remains unchanged unless `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, in which case `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains one element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is reduced by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
