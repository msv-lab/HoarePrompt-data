The code modifies the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). Given that `sm` is initially equal to `suf[n]` and `sm` is non-negative, the new value of `sm` will be the remainder when `sm` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the initial value of `sm` is non-negative and the modulus operation does not change the fact that `sm` is non-negative, the updated value of `sm` remains non-negative and is less than \(10^9 + 7\).

Output State: **The list consists of all zeros, `sm` is equal to `suf[n] % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0**.
