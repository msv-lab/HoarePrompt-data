The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 2, so now `y` is 3. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1.**
