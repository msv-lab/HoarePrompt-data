The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. Specifically, `na_frente` is assigned the first integer read from the input minus 1, and `pos_final` is assigned the second integer read from the input minus 2. However, the provided code snippet does not reflect these adjustments; it simply reads two integers and assigns them directly to `na_frente` and `pos_final`.

Given this, the new values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be the integers read from the input without any modification.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `total` is the accumulated cost from `na_frente` to `0` using the smallest possible costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`; `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
