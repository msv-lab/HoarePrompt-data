Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first `n-2` elements are `0`. If the last element of `a` or the second-to-last element of `a` is not `0`, they remain decremented by their respective `opNum` values. If both the last and second-to-last elements of `a` are `0`, then they remain `0`. If `stop` is True, it remains True. If `stop` is False, it remains False.**
