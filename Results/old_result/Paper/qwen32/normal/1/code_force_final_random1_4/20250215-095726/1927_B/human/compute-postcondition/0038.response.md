The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. Additionally, `l` must be greater than 4 to allow the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 4, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one character from `alp`, `j` is 4**
