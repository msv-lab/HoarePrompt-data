You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()` which calls `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_14()` which calls `func_7()` to read two integers from the input.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The binary representation of `n` is computed using `bin(n)[2:]` and stored in `b`.
   - The length of this binary representation is stored in `l`.

3. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`**:
   - If `k` is 1, the program handles this case separately.
     - If `n` is 2, it returns `[2]` as the sequence.
     - Otherwise, it initializes the sequence `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 2.

4. **General Case**:
   - For `k != 1`, the binary representation of `k` is computed using `bin(k)[2:]` and stored in `bk`.
   - The length of this binary representation is stored in `lk`.
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with powers of 2 up to `lk - 1`.
   - It then calculates and appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Finally, it appends additional powers of 2 starting from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed followed by the sequence itself.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
  - The program specifically ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by calculating `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and appending `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`.

- **Subsequences Sum to All Values Between 1 and `n` Except `k`**:
  - By including powers of 2 and carefully chosen values, the program aims to cover all sums between 1 and `n` except `k`.
  - This is achieved through the inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and other strategically chosen values.

- **Sequence Length Constraint**:
  - The sequence length is kept within the limit of 25 by carefully selecting the values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements by ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing subsequences to sum to all other values between 1 and `n`. The sequence length constraint is also respected.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
