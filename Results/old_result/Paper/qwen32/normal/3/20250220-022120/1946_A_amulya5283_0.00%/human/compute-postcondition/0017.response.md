The loop condition is `while heap[0] <= current_median`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the smallest element in the `heap` (which is `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `heap[0]` and `current_median` such that `heap[0]` remains less than or equal to `current_median`. Since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we can modify `heap[0]` or `current_median`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, which is the next smallest element after the popped one plus one.
- `current_median` is the element at the index `median_index` in the sorted list `arr`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `heap[0]` does not exceed `current_median`. Since we can adjust `heap[0]`, we can simply set `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Let's assume `current_median` is `m`. We can set `heap[0]` to `m - 1` (assuming `m > 1`), or to any value less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes the next smallest element after the popped one plus one; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of the heap; `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`**.

Since we can't specify the exact value of `current_median` without more information, we'll just ensure `heap[0]` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `current_median`.
