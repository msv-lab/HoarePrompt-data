The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their values and descriptions. Specifically, `t` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` still contains the list of tuples with the specified constraints, and `results` is still an empty list. The variable `n` is still the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is now the sorted version of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
