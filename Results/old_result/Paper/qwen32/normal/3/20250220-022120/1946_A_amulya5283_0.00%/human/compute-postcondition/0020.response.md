Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes the next smallest element after the popped one plus one, excluding the smallest element that was just removed, and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of the heap; `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median` (assuming the heap property is maintained after the pop operation)**

The only change in the output state is that the value of `operations` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
