Output State: **`smallest` is `smallest + 1`; `heap` has one more element, `smallest + 1`; the heap property is restored; `current_median` must be less than or equal to `smallest`; `operations` is incremented by 2.**

Explanation: The code pushes `smallest + 1` onto the heap, increasing the number of elements in the heap by one. The heap property is maintained after the push operation. The value of `smallest` remains `smallest + 1` as it was before the push operation, and `current_median` must still be less than or equal to `smallest`. The `operations` counter is incremented by 2, as stated in the initial conditions.
