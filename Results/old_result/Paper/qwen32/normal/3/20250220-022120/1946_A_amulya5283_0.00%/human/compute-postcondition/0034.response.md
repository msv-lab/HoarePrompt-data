Output State: **`smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`; `heap` has the same number of elements as before, with the heap property restored, and includes the value `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the `operations` variable has been increased by 1, while the `smallest` variable and the `heap` structure remain as described in the initial state, with the heap now including the value `smallest + 1`.
