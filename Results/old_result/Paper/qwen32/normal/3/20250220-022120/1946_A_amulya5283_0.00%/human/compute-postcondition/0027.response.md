Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4; `n` is the first element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.**

Explanation: The variable `current_median` is assigned the value of the element at the `median_index` in the sorted list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
