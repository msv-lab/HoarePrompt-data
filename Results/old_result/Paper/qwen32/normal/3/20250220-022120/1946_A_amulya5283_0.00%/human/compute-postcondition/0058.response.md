The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Given that `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, after this operation, `smallest` will hold the smallest element that was in the heap before the operation, and the heap will be updated to reflect the removal of this element.

Since `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` before the operation, after the operation, the new `heap[0]` will still be less than or equal to `current_median` because `heapq.heappop` ensures the heap property is maintained.

The other variables (`operations`, `results`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 1, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation, `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`**.
