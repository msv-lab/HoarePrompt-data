The code snippet appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. None of the other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **heap is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than the current median, operations is the total number of iterations the loop ran, results contains the value of operations and possibly other values from previous iterations, i is `k + 1`, t is `t`, n and arr are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with arr sorted in ascending order, median_index is `n // 2`, current_median is `arr[n // 2]`.**
