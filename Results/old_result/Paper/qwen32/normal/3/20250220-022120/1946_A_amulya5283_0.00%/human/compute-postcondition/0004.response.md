The code snippet calculates the median index of the sorted list `arr` for the i-th test case. The variable `median_index` is assigned the value of `n // 2`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, or `arr`. It only introduces a new variable `median_index` with the calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
