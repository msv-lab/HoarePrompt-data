The given Python code snippet modifies the `heap` variable by assigning it the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of the array. This means `heap` will now contain the second half of the sorted array `arr`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `heap` is now `arr[median_index:]`, containing the second half of the sorted array `arr`.
- All other variables (`operations`, `results`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is the total number of increments performed to achieve the initial state, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.**
