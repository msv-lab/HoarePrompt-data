Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the heap's root element is greater than `current_median`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the heap will only contain elements that are greater than the `current_median`. The `operations` variable will reflect the total number of times the loop ran, which is the number of times the smallest element in the heap was incremented until it exceeded the `current_median`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial definitions, except for the `heap` and `operations`.
