To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`, so the variables of interest are `i` and `t`.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Variable `t`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. Since `t` is already provided as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. No adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

2. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop control variable that gets automatically initialized to 0 before the first iteration and increments by 1 after each iteration. Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and `t` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. No adjustment is required for `i` before the loop starts.

Given that `t` is already a positive integer and `i` will be initialized properly by the `range` function, the loop is guaranteed to execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The other variables `test_cases` and `results` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already correct for the loop to execute. Here is the final state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `i` is 0**.

However, since `i` is automatically initialized by the `range` function, we typically do not explicitly state its value before the loop starts. Thus, the state can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list**.
