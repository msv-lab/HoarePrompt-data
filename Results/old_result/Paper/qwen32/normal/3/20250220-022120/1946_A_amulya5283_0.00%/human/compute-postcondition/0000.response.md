Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; results is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
