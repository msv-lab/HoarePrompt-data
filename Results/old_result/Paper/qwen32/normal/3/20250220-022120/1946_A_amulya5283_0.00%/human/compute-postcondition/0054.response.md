The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation modifies the `heap` by removing the smallest element from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 0, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**

In natural language: The smallest element from the heap has been removed and stored in the variable `smallest`. The heap itself is now missing this smallest element, while all other variables retain their initial values.
