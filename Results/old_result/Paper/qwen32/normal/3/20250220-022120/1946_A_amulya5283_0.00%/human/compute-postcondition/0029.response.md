The given Python code snippet uses `heapq.heapify(heap)` to transform the list `heap` into a heap in-place. This operation rearranges the elements in `heap` to satisfy the heap property, but it does not change the elements themselves or the other variables in the initial state. Specifically, `heap` will now be a valid heap, but its elements will still be the same integers from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`.

Here is the Output State:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4; `n` is the first element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`.**

In simpler terms, the list `heap` is now a heap, but all other variables remain unchanged.
