To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the heap and other variables. The loop continues to execute as long as the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to the current median of the array.

### Key Points:
1. **Heap Operations**: The loop pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and then pushes it back into the heap.
2. **Operations Count**: Each time the loop runs, the `operations` counter is incremented by 1.
3. **Condition for Loop Termination**: The loop terminates when the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.

### Final State Analysis:
- The loop will continue until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
- The heap will be modified such that all elements are at least as large as the current median.
- The `operations` counter will reflect the total number of times the loop ran.

### Output State:
- **heap**: A heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than the current median.
- **operations**: The total number of iterations the loop ran.
- **results**: Contains the value of `operations`.
- **i**: Remains `k + 1`.
- **t**: Remains `t`.
- **n**: Remains the same as assigned from `test_cases[k + 1]`.
- **arr**: Remains sorted in ascending order.
- **median_index**: Remains `n // 2`.
- **current_median**: Remains `arr[n // 2]`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop finishes executing, the heap will contain elements that are all greater than or equal to the current median. The `operations` counter will indicate how many times the loop ran to achieve this state. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **heap is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than the current median, operations is the total number of iterations the loop ran, results contains the value of operations, i is `k + 1`, t is `t`, n and arr are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with arr sorted in ascending order, median_index is `n // 2`, current_median is `arr[n // 2]`.**
