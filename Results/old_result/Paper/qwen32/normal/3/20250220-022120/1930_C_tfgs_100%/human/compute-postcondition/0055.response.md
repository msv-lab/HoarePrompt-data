Given the code snippet `cnt -= adv`, and the initial state where `adv` is 0, the value of `cnt` will not change because subtracting 0 from any number results in the same number.

Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0; `a` remains unchanged; `ans` includes `adv` additional elements: `a[i - 1] - 0 - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`; `counter[a[i]]` is -1 for the specific `i`; `cur` is the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `adv` is 0; `cnt` remains unchanged.**
