The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, provided it is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, and `a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `i` is 1**
