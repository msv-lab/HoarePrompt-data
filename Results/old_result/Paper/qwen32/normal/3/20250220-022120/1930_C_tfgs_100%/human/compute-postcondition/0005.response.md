The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and thus `a[1]` (which is `a_2` in the list since indexing starts at 0) will be incremented by `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.

The initial state specifies that `a_1` is `a_1 + 1` and `a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. However, since `a_2` is specifically affected by the code, we need to update its value. The other elements of `a` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, and `a_3, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `i` is 1**.
