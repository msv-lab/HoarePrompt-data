Postcondition: **`n` remains greater than 0; `a` remains unchanged; if `i > 0`, `ans` includes `adv` additional elements: `a[i - 1] - 0 - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`; `counter[a[i]]` is -1 for the specific `i`; `cur` is the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values minus `adv`; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `adv` is 0; `cnt` remains unchanged. If `i` is not greater than 0, the state of `ans`, `counter`, `cur`, `adv`, and `cnt` remains as described in the precondition.**
