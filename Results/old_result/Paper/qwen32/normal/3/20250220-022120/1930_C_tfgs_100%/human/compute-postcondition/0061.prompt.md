Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing unique integers derived from the original list where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n` with duplicates removed, sorted in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2; `ans` contains its previous elements plus `a[i]`; `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1; `cur` is increased by `counter[a[i]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains greater than 0; `a` remains a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2; if `i > 0`, `ans` will contain all the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for each `i` and `j` in the specified ranges plus `a[i]`, `counter[a[i]]` will be -1 for the specific `i`, `cur` will be the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, and `adv` will be recalculated in the last iteration to be the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for the last valid `i`; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`. If `i` is not greater than 0, the program does nothing additional to the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains greater than 0; `a` remains unchanged; if `i > 0`, `ans` includes `adv` additional elements: `a[i - 1] - 0 - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` and now includes `a[i]`; `counter[a[i]]` is -2 for the specific `i`; `cur` is the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values minus `adv` minus 3; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `adv` is 0; `cnt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
