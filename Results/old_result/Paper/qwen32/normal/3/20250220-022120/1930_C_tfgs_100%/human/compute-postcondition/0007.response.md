The value of `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. Given `i` is 2, `a[2]` is incremented by `2 + 1 = 3`. Therefore, `a_2` becomes `a_2 + 3`.

The initial state specifies that `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, and `a_3, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. After the code execution, `a_1` and `a_3, ..., a_n` remain the same, but `a_2` is adjusted by an additional 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 5`, and `a_3, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `i` is 2**.
