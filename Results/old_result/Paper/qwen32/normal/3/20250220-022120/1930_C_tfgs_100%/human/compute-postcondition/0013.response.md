The code snippet calculates the difference between `n` and the length of the list `a`, and assigns this value to the variable `cnt`. The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing unique integers derived from the original list where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n` with duplicates removed, sorted in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.
