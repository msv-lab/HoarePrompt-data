The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cur` to 0. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the initial conditions for `n`, `a`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n`, `i` is `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the list `a`, `cur` is 0.**
