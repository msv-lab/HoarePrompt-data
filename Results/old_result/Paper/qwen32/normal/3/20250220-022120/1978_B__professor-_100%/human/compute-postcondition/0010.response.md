Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input. `b` is greater than `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
