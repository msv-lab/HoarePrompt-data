The `print(n * a)` statement will output the product of the integers `n` and `a`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `a` is an integer read from the input.
- `b` is an integer read from the input and is less than or equal to `a`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, but it is also not used in the print statement.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n * a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
