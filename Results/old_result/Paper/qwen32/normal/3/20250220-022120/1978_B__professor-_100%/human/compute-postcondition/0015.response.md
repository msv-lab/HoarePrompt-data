Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). 
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
- Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` function is:
\[ \text{int} \left( \frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2} \right) \]

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Calculate \(2 \cdot b - n + 1\):**
   - This part of the expression depends on the values of `b` and `n`.
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it doesn't directly affect this part of the expression.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the difference between `b` and `a` is either \(\geq n\) or \(< n\), but this condition does not directly influence the calculation of \(2 \cdot b - n + 1\).

2. **Multiply the result by `n`:**
   - This scales the result of the previous step by `n`.

3. **Divide by 2 using integer division (`//`):**
   - This divides the result of the multiplication by 2 and takes the floor of the result, ensuring the final output is an integer.

### Output Description:
The output of the `print` statement is the integer value of the expression \(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\).

Given that the exact values of `b` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `b` and `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)** (where `b` and `n` are the input integers)
