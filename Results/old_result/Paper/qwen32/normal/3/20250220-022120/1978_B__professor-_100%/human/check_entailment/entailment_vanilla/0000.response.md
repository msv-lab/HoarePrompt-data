Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob is selling buns with a usual price `a` and a modified price for the first `k` buns. The price of the `i`-th bun sold at the modified price is `(b - i + 1)` coins. We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling all `n` buns.

### Conditions to Consider

1. **If `b <= a`**:
   - Selling any bun at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` will yield less or equal profit compared to selling it at the usual price `a`.
   - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price.
   - **Profit = n * a**

2. **If `b - a >= n`**:
   - In this case, the modified prices for the first `n` buns will be strictly decreasing and higher than the usual price `a`.
   - The modified prices will be: `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-(n-1)`.
   - The sum of these prices is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-(n-1))`.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is `n/2 * (first_term + last_term)`.
   - Here, the first term is `b` and the last term is `b-(n-1) = b-n+1`.
   - **Profit = n/2 * (b + (b-n+1)) = n/2 * (2b - n + 1)**

3. **If `b - a < n`**:
   - We need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is the sum of the series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
   - The sum of this series is `k/2 * (b + (b-k+1)) = k/2 * (2b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price is `(n-k) * a`.
   - The total profit is `k/2 * (2b - k + 1) + (n-k) * a`.
   - However, since `b - a < n`, the maximum `k` for which the modified price is higher than the usual price is `b - a`.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the profit for `k = b - a` and add the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - **Profit = (b - a)/2 * (2b - (b - a) + 1) + a * n = (b - a)/2 * (b + a + 1) + a * n**

### Program Analysis

The given program correctly handles the three cases described above:

1. **If `b <= a`**:
   - It prints `n * a`.

2. **If `b - a >= n`**:
   - It prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.

3. **If `b - a < n`**:
   - It prints `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

### Conclusion

The program covers all possible scenarios and calculates the maximum profit correctly for each case.

**Correctness: True**
