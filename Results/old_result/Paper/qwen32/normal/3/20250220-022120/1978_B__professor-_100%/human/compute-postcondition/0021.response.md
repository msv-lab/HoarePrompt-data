The `print(n * a)` statement will output the product of the integers `n` and `a`. According to the initial state, `n` and `a` are integers that are read from the input, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
