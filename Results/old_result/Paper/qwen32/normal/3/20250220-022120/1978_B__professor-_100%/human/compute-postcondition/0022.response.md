To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement step by step using the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

Let's analyze the expression inside the `print` function:

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `2 * b`: This multiplies the integer `b` by 2.
   - `2 * b - n + 1`: This subtracts `n` from `2 * b` and then adds 1.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result of `2 * b - n + 1` by `n`.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`: This performs integer division of the result by 2.

2. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`. Since the result of the integer division `//` is already an integer, the `int()` function does not change the value.

3. **Output Description**:
   - The output is the result of the expression \(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\) after performing integer division.

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of the expression.

Output: **\(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\) (where \(n\) and \(b\) are integers read from the input)**
