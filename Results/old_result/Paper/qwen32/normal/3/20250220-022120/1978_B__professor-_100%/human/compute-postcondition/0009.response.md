Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement step-by-step based on the given initial state:

The expression is:
```
int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)
```

1. **Identify the components:**
   - `b` and `a` are integers where `b > a` and `b - a < n`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, but `t` is not used in the expression.

2. **Evaluate the expression:**
   - `(b - a)`: This is the difference between `b` and `a`, which is a positive integer.
   - `(b - a + 1)`: This is one more than the difference between `b` and `a`.
   - `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`: This part of the expression calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers, starting from `1` up to `(b - a)`. This is a well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - `a * n`: This is simply `a` multiplied by `n`.

3. **Combine the results:**
   - The expression first calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers.
   - Then, it adds `a * n` to this sum.

The expression essentially calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `a` up to `b` and then adds `a * n`.

4. **Final output:**
   - The final output is the integer value of the entire expression.

Given the constraints and the structure of the expression, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **The sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` plus `a * n`**

To make it more precise:
- The sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` is given by the formula for the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers, starting from `1`, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`. This sum is then adjusted to start from `a` instead of `1` by adding `a * (b - a)`.
- Adding `a * n` to this sum gives the final result.

Thus, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **The sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` plus `a * n` (where the sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` is calculated as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * (b - a)` and `a * n` is `a` multiplied by `n`)**

For simplicity, we can describe it more succinctly as:

Output: **The sum of the arithmetic series from `a` to `b` plus `a * n`**
