To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression step by step based on the given initial state and the formula in the `print` statement.

The given expression is:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

Let's analyze the components of this expression:

1. **`b - a`**: This is the difference between `b` and `a`.
    - If `b <= a`, then `b - a <= 0`.
    - If `b > a`, then `b - a > 0`.

2. **`(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**: This part of the expression calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers if `b > a`. If `b <= a`, this part evaluates to 0.
    - If `b <= a`, then `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 = 0`.
    - If `b > a`, then this is the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers, which is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\).

3. **`a * n`**: This is simply `a` multiplied by `n`.

Putting it all together:
- If `b <= a`, the expression simplifies to `a * n` because the first part of the expression is 0.
- If `b > a`, the expression becomes the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus `a * n`.

Thus, the final output depends on the relationship between `b` and `a`:
- If `b <= a`, the output is `a * n`.
- If `b > a`, the output is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\).

Given the initial state, we can't determine exact numerical values for `a`, `b`, and `n`, but we can describe the output based on the conditions.

Output: **\(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\) if \(b > a\); otherwise, \(a \times n\) (where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers and \(n\) is an integer)**
