To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variables evolve with each iteration and what the final conditions are when the loop terminates.

### Understanding the Loop:
- **Initialization**: For each test case, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are initialized.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `min(n, k)` iterations, updating `b`, `s`, `bp`, `sp`, `bm`, and `sm` in each iteration.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `k` becomes 0 or after `n` iterations, whichever comes first.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.
- **`i`**: Will be `min(n, k) - 1` when the loop finishes for a single test case.
- **`n`**: Remains the same for each test case.
- **`k`**: Will be 0 if `k` was greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, it will be `k - min(n, k)`.
- **`b`**: Will be `p[p[...p[b]...]] - 1` (updated `min(n, k)` times).
- **`s`**: Will be `p[p[...p[s]...]] - 1` (updated `min(n, k)` times).
- **`p`**: Remains the same for each test case.
- **`a`**: Remains the same for each test case.
- **`sp`**: Will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for `min(n, k)` iterations.
- **`bp`**: Will be the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for `min(n, k)` iterations.
- **`bm`**: Will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for `min(n, k)` iterations.
- **`sm`**: Will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for `min(n, k)` iterations.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop for a single test case, the final output state will depend on the values of `bm` and `sm`. The program will print "Bodya" if `bm` is greater than `sm`, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater than `bm`, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `min(n, k) - 1`; `n` is unchanged; `k` is 0 if `k` was greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k - min(n, k)`; `b` is `p[p[...p[b]...]] - 1` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `s` is `p[p[...p[s]...]] - 1` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `p` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for `min(n, k)` iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for `min(n, k)` iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for `min(n, k)` iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for `min(n, k)` iterations.**

In simpler terms, the final output state after all iterations for a single test case will determine whether "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" is printed based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm`.
