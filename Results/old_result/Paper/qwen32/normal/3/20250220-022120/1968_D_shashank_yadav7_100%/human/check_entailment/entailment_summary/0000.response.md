### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be 0-based indices (`b` and `s`), as Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - It initializes `sp` and `bp` with the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. These represent the initial scores of Sasha and Bodya.
   - It also initializes `bm` and `sm` with the potential maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, assuming they stay in their current positions for all `k` turns.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation `p` and adds the corresponding values from `a` to their scores.
   - It updates `bm` and `sm` to be the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, considering the current and future moves.

5. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - After simulating the game for `k` turns, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Potential Scores:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates `bm` and `sm` by multiplying the current position's value with the remaining turns `k` and adding it to the initial score. This does not correctly simulate the game, as it assumes the player will stay in the same position for the remaining turns, which is not necessarily the case.
  - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the scores based on the actual moves.

- **Loop Condition:**
  - The loop condition `for i in range(n)` is incorrect. It should be `for i in range(k)` because the game lasts for exactly `k` turns.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the game and therefore does not provide the correct results.

**Correctness: False**
