To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop and the changes it makes to the variables in each iteration.

The loop iterates `n` times, but it breaks if `k` becomes 0. Therefore, the actual number of iterations is the minimum of `n` and `k`.

Let's summarize the changes in each iteration:
- `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `b` and `s` are updated based on the `p` list.
- `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
- `sm` and `bm` are updated to the maximum of their current values and the new computed values.

Given the initial state and the first 3 iterations, we can see the pattern:
- After 1 iteration: `k` is decreased by 1, `b` and `s` are updated, `sp` and `bp` are doubled, and `sm` and `bm` are updated to the new maximum values.
- After 2 iterations: `k` is decreased by another 1, `b` and `s` are updated again, `sp` is now 3 times `a[s]`, and `bp` is now 3 times `a[b]`. `sm` and `bm` are updated again.
- After 3 iterations: `k` is decreased by another 1, `b` and `s` are updated again, `sp` is now 4 times `a[s]`, and `bp` is now 4 times `a[b]` minus `a[b]` from the previous iteration. `sm` and `bm` are updated again.

Following this pattern, after `min(n, k)` iterations:
- `k` will be `k - min(n, k)`.
- `b` and `s` will be updated `min(n, k)` times based on the `p` list.
- `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` added `min(n, k) + 1` times.
- `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` added `min(n, k) + 1` times.
- `sm` and `bm` will be the maximum of their current values and the new computed values in each iteration.

The final output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be `min(n, k) - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` will be `k - min(n, k)`.
- `b` and `s` will be updated `min(n, k)` times based on the `p` list.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `sp` will be `a[s] * (min(n, k) + 1)`.
- `bp` will be `a[b] * (min(n, k) + 1)`.
- `sm` and `bm` will be the maximum of their computed values across all iterations.
- `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `min(n, k) - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer minus `min(n, k)`; `b` is `p[p[p[...[b]...]] - 1]` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `s` is `p[p[p[...[s]...]] - 1]` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s] * (min(n, k) + 1)`; `bp` is `a[b] * (min(n, k) + 1)`; `sm` is the maximum of all computed values of `a[s] * k + sp` across iterations; `bm` is the maximum of all computed values of `a[b] * k + bp` across iterations; `p` is a list of integers read from the input.**
