Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input with `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is decremented by 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `k` is decremented by 1.**

Natural language: The value of `k` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
