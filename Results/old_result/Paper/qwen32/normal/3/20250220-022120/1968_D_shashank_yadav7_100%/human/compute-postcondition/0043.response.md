Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `n-1`; `n` is the number of iterations; `k` is 0; `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1` (nested `p` operations `n` times); `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration; and `bm` is greater than `sm`.**
