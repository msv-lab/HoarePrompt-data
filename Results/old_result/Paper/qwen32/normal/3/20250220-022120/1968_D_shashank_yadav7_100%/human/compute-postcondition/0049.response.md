Let's break down the given information and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` is the number of iterations.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is defined as the result of nested `p` operations `n` times starting from `b`.
- `s` is defined as the result of nested `p` operations `n` times starting from `s`.
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is a simple string literal.

Output: **Draw**
