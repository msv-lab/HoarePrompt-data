Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Inputs:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `k`: An input integer minus `min(n, k)`.
   - `i`: `min(n, k) - 1`.
   - `b`: Initially set to some value, then updated `min(n, k)` times using a nested indexing method on list `p`.
   - `s`: Initially set to some value, then updated `min(n, k)` times using a nested indexing method on list `p`.
   - `a`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `sp`: Calculated as `a[s] * (min(n, k) + 1)`.
   - `bp`: Calculated as `a[b] * (min(n, k) + 1)`.
   - `sm`: The maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across iterations.
   - `bm`: The maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across iterations.
   - `p`: A list of integers read from the input.

2. **Special Condition:**
   - `bm` is explicitly set to `sm`.

### Print Statement Analysis

The print statement is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Explanation

The print statement `print('Draw')` is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The value `'Draw'` is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or calculations described in the initial state.

### Conclusion

The print statement will output the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
