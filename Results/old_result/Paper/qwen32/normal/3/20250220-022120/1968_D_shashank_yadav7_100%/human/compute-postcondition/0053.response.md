The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. This will override the previous values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` as described in the initial state. The values of `t`, `i`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `n`; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `s` is an input integer; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration; and `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.**
