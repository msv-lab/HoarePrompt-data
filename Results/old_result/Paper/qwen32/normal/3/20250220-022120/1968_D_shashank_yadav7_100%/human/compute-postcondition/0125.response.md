The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(0, bp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
