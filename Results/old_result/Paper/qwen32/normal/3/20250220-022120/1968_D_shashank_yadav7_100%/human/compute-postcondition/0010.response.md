The code snippet `sm = a[s] * k` assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to the variable `sm`. The value of `s` is already decremented by 1, so `a[s]` refers to the element at the index `s` in the list `a`. The variable `k` remains unchanged and is used in the multiplication.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input with `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is decremented by 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`.**
