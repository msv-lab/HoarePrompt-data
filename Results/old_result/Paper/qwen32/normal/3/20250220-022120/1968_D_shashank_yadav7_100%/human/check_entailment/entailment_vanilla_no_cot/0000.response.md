Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Loop Condition and Movement**: The current loop condition and movement logic are incorrect. The loop runs `n` times, but it should run `k` times since the game lasts for `k` turns. Additionally, the movement logic inside the loop should be updated to correctly simulate the game turns.

2. **Score Calculation**: The score calculation is incorrect. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the scenario where players can choose to stay or move in each turn. Instead, it only considers moving to the next position in the permutation.

3. **Initialization of Scores**: The initial scores are correctly set, but the subsequent score updates inside the loop are not correctly implemented.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        visited_b = [False] * n
        visited_s = [False] * n
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            if not visited_b[b]:
                visited_b[b] = True
                b = p[b] - 1
            if not visited_s[s]:
                visited_s[s] = True
                s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The loop runs `k` times to simulate `k` turns.
- The scores are updated correctly by adding the value of `a` at the current position in each turn.
- The players move to the next position in the permutation if they haven't visited it before, simulating the movement logic.
- The `visited` lists keep track of whether a player has visited a position before to avoid infinite loops in cycles.
