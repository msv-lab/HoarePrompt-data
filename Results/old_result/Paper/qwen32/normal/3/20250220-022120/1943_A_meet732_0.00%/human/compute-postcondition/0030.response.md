The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `c` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cntl`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `c` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.**
