Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
