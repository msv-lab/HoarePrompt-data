Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Additionally, either `c` is False or `j` is equal to `n`.**
