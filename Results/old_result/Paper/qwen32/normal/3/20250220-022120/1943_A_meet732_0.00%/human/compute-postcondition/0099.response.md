Let's analyze the given initial state and code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. 
- The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0.
- `c` is either -1 or 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is initialized to 2.
- The condition `if cntl[j] < 2` determines the value of `c` or whether to break out of a loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
- `j` is initialized to 2.
- There is no code provided that modifies the value of `j` before the `print` statement. Therefore, `j` remains 2.
- The `print(j)` statement will output the current value of `j`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
