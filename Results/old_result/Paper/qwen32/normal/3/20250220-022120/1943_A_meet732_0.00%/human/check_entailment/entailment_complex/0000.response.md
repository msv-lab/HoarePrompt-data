### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - An array `cntl` of size `n + 1` is initialized to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - The program then iterates through `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cntl` for each element.

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is `0`, it means `0` is not present in `a`, and hence, the MEX is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the program sets `c` to the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most two `0`s to maximize the MEX.
   - The program then iterates through `cntl` starting from `1` to `n`. For each element `j` in `cntl`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, it means there are fewer than two occurrences of `j` in `a`. The program decrements `c` by `1`.
     - If `c` reaches `0` or `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop. This is because `j` is the smallest integer that does not have at least two occurrences in `a`, which is the MEX.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX by ensuring that the smallest integer that does not have at least two occurrences in `a` is chosen. This is because Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and she can pick at most two `0`s, and Bob will try to minimize the MEX by picking elements that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The program handles edge cases, such as when `0` is not present in `a` (MEX is `0`), and when there are no integers with fewer than two occurrences up to `n` (MEX is `n`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
