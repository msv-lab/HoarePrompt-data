### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score, which is defined as the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. The strategy revolves around the counts of elements in the array `a`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, reads `n` and the list `a`.
2. **Counting Elements**: It counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using a list `cntl`.
3. **Handling Case When 0 is Not Present**: If `0` is not present in `a` (`cntl[0] == 0`), then the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`.
4. **Handling General Case**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s in `a` (`cntl[0]`). This is because Alice can add up to two `0`s to `c` if they are available.
   - The program then iterates through the numbers from `1` to `n`. For each number `j`, if the count of `j` in `a` is less than `2`, it decrements `c` by `1`. This step is based on the observation that Bob will try to block Alice from adding more elements that could increase the MEX.
   - When `c` reaches `0` or `j` reaches `n`, the program outputs `j` as the MEX.

#### Correctness of the Strategy:
- If `0` is not present in `a`, the MEX is indeed `0`.
- If `0` is present, Alice can place up to two `0`s in `c` initially. After that, each time an element `j` with a count less than `2` is encountered, it effectively decreases the number of elements Alice can add to increase the MEX. When `c` reaches `0`, it means that Alice can no longer add elements that would increase the MEX further, and `j` is the smallest integer not in `c`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy and computes the MEX of `c` as intended.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
