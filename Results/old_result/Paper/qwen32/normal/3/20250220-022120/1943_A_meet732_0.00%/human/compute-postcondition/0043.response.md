The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes values from the list `a`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next value that `i` will take from the list `a`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element.
- `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` has taken a value from the list `a`. To start the next iteration, `i` should take the next value from the list `a`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `i` took the `k`-th element of the list `a`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should take the `(k+1)`-th element of the list `a`.

However, we do not have the exact value of `k` from the provided state. But we know that `i` will take the next value in the list `a` for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can't specify the exact next value of `i` in the state. But we know that `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.

To be more precise, if we denote the current index of `i` in the list `a` as `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1, and `i` should be `a[k+1]`.

Since we do not have the value of `k`, we can say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.

If we assume `i` was the `k`-th element in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` will be the `(k+1)`-th element. But without the exact `k`, we can't specify `i` precisely. Therefore, the most accurate state we can provide is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.
