The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` reduces the value of `lex` by 26. Given the initial state, `lex` has already been adjusted to either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26` based on its initial value. After this operation, the new value of `lex` will be further reduced by 26.

Let's consider the possible initial values of `lex` after the first adjustment:
1. If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, it was adjusted to `lex - 1`. After `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` will be `(lex - 1) - 26` or `lex - 27`.
2. If the initial `lex` was greater than 26, it was adjusted to `lex - 26`. After `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` will be `(lex - 26) - 26` or `lex - 52`.

Therefore, the new value of `lex` will be either `lex - 27` or `lex - 52`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], `lex` is either `lex - 27` or `lex - 52`, and `j` is 1.**
