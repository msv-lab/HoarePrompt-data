To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to examine how the loop processes each iteration and how the variables evolve.

### Understanding the Loop:
- The outer loop runs `cases` times.
- For each iteration (`i` from 0 to `cases - 1`):
  - An array `arr` is initialized as an empty list.
  - A value `lex` is read from the input.
  - The inner loop runs twice (`j` from 0 to 1):
    - Based on the value of `lex`, it appends either 1, 26, or 26 to `arr` and adjusts `lex`.
  - After the inner loop, `lex` is appended to `arr`.
  - The array `arr` is sorted.
  - The characters corresponding to the values in `arr` (by converting each value `x` to `chr(x + 96)`) are printed.

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]` with `lex` adjusted.
- After 2 iterations: `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.
- After 3 iterations: `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]` where `lex` is adjusted to be between 1 and 26.

### Final State:
- After all iterations (`cases` times), the loop will have processed `cases` different values of `lex`.
- Each iteration results in a sorted array `arr` of length 3, which is printed as three characters.
- The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- The state of `cases` remains unchanged as it dictates the number of iterations.
- The state of `i` will be `cases` after the loop finishes.
- The state of `j` will be 2 at the end of each iteration, but it resets to 0 at the start of each new iteration.
- The state of `k` will be 3 at the end of each iteration, but it resets to 0 at the start of each new iteration.
- The state of `arr` will be the final array processed in the last iteration.
- The state of `lex` will be the final value processed in the last iteration.

### Output State:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is an integer, i is equal to cases, j is 2, k is 3, arr is the final sorted array processed in the last iteration, lex is the final value processed in the last iteration.**

### Natural Language Description:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `cases` remains the same as the input. The variable `i` will be equal to `cases` because the loop has run `cases` times. The variable `j` will be 2 because it is the last value it takes in the inner loop, and `k` will be 3 because it is the last value it takes in the innermost loop. The array `arr` will contain the final sorted values processed in the last iteration, and `lex` will hold the final value processed in the last iteration.
