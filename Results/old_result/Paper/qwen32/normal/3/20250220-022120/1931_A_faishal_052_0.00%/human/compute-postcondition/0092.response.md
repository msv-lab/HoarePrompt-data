The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive) because `range(2)` generates the sequence 0, 1. The initial value of `j` before the loop starts is 2, which is outside the range that the loop will consider. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be within the range 0 to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is `[]`, `lex` is an input integer**
