Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input minus 1 and `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `k` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 1, so if `lex` was originally a value between 1 and 26, it is now between 0 and 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
