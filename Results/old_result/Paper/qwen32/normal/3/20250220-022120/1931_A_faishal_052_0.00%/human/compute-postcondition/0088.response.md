The loop provided is a `for` loop that iterates over the range of 3, meaning it will execute exactly 3 times. The loop body prints out a character based on the value in the `arr` list at the current index `k`, plus 96, which corresponds to the ASCII value for lowercase letters ('a' to 'z').

Let's analyze the state after each iteration:
- After the 1st iteration (`k=0`), it prints the character corresponding to `arr[0] + 96`.
- After the 2nd iteration (`k=1`), it prints the character corresponding to `arr[1] + 96`.
- After the 3rd iteration (`k=2`), it prints the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.

Since the loop runs exactly 3 times and `k` iterates from 0 to 2, after the loop finishes, `k` will be 3 (the value after the last iteration).

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body. The value of `arr` also remains unchanged unless modified within the loop, which it is not.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.**

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `k` will be 3, while `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr` will retain their initial values.
