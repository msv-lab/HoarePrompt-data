Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26 or 52. `arr` is either `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`. If `lex` was originally less than 52, it is adjusted by subtracting 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, it is adjusted by subtracting 26 or 52, and can be 0, 26, or a value between 26 and 51.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the conditions and adjustments made in both the if and else parts.
