Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is `[]`, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1] or [26]. If `lex` is an integer such that 0 <= lex <= 25, `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `arr` is [26] and `lex` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 1], [1, 26], [26, 1], or [26, 26]. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` is unchanged. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than 25 after the if-else block, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` was originally greater than -1, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` was originally greater than -1 and less than 52, `arr` is [26, 26, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. In all cases, `lex` is adjusted as described and `arr` is updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
