The code `lex = lex - 26` subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Given that the initial value of `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, after the operation, `lex` will be a value greater than 0 but less than 26.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is a value greater than 0 but less than 26, `k` is 3**.
