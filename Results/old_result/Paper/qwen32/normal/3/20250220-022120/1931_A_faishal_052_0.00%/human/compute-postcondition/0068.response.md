Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is [1, 26] and `lex` is either `lex - 27` (if `lex < 52`) or less than or equal to 0 (if `lex >= 52`). If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is either `lex - 52` (if `lex < 52`) or less than 26 (if `lex >= 52`). If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is either `lex - 52` (if `lex < 52`) or 26 or greater but less than 52 (if `lex >= 52`).**
