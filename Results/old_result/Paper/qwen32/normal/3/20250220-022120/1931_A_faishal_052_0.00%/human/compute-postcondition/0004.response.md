In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it is used in the `range(2)` function. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which it will because `range(2)` generates values 0 and 1.

The variables `t`, `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex` are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust them to ensure the loop executes. However, we can confirm that the loop will execute as long as the conditions for the loop head are met, which they are in this case.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will run regardless of the values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**
