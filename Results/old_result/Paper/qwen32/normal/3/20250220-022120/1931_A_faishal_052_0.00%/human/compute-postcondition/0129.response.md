To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. (This variable doesn't affect the current print statement.)
- `cases` is greater than 1. (This variable also doesn't affect the current print statement.)
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 3.
- `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]` where `lex` is adjusted to be between 1 and 26.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```
Let's break this down:
- `arr[k]` refers to the element at index `k` in the list `arr`.
- Since `k` is 3, we need to look at the third element of `arr` (index 2, considering 0-based indexing).
- `arr[k] + 96` adds 96 to the third element of `arr`.
- `chr()` converts the resulting integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
- `end=''` means that the output will not be followed by a newline.

### Possible Values of `arr[k]`:
1. If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, then `arr[k]` is `lex`.
2. If `arr` is `[1, lex, 26]`, then `arr[k]` is `26`.
3. If `arr` is `[lex, 26, 26]`, then `arr[k]` is `26`.

### ASCII Conversion:
- For the first case, `chr(lex + 96)` will convert `lex + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character.
- For the second and third cases, `chr(26 + 96)` will convert `122` to its corresponding ASCII character, which is `'z'`.

### Output Description:
- If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, the output will be the ASCII character corresponding to `lex + 96`.
- If `arr` is `[1, lex, 26]` or `[lex, 26, 26]`, the output will be `'z'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **'z' or the ASCII character corresponding to `lex + 96` (where `lex` is the third element of `arr` and 1 <= `lex` <= 26)**

Since we don't have the exact value of `lex`, we provide both possibilities based on the possible configurations of `arr`.
