Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex], and lex has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either lex - 2 if the initial lex was less than or equal to 26, or lex - 27 if the initial lex was greater than 26 but less than 52, or lex - 52 if the initial lex was 52 or greater, k is 3**

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 3 times in this case), the variable `k` will have the value 3. All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr` including the adjusted `lex`) remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop. The loop iterates exactly 3 times, printing characters based on the values in `arr`, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, or `lex` outside of the loop.
