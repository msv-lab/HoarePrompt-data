The code snippet appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Therefore, the value of `arr` changes based on its initial state, which can be one of `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. After appending `26`, the possible new states of `arr` are `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26], `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either `lex - 1` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 26` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26, and `j` is 1**.
