Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `arr` is either [1] or [26]. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, it has been decremented by 1. If `lex` was initially greater than 26 but less than 52, it is now a value greater than 0 but less than 26. If `lex` was initially 52 or greater, it is now a value greater than 26.**
