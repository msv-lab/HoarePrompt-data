Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 26, 1], [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26]. If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. If the initial `lex` was greater than 26, `lex` is either `lex - 27` or `lex - 52`.**
