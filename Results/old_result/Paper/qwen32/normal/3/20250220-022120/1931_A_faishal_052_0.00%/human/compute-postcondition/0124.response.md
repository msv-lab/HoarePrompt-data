Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 1, lex], or [26, 26, lex], and `lex` is adjusted based on the value of `lex` after the iterations.**

In natural language: The value of `arr` has been updated to include `lex` as its third element. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.
