The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and the loop will execute again for `j` equal to 1.

The other variables `t`, `cases`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, and `lex` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1] or [26]. If `lex` is an integer such that 0 <= lex <= 25, `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `arr` is [26] and `lex` remains unchanged.**
