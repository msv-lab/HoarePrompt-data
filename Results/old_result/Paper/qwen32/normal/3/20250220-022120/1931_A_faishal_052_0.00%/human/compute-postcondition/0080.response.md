The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is a list of 2 elements, each of which is either 1 or 26 based on the initial value of `lex`. After appending `lex`, `arr` will have 3 elements.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `lex` is not altered by this operation but is now part of the list `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list of 3 elements where the first two elements are either 1 or 26 based on the initial value of `lex`, and the third element is `lex`.**
