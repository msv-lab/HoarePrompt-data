Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [26, 1, 26], [26, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26]. `lex` is `lex - 26`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decremented by 26. Depending on its original value, `arr` could be one of three possibilities: [26, 1, 26], [26, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26]. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
