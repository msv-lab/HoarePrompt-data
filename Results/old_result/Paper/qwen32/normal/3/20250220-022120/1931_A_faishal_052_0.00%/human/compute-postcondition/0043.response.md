To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `cases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `arr` is one of the following lists: \([1, 1, \text{lex}]\), \([1, 26, \text{lex}]\), or \([26, 26, \text{lex}]\).
- `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value:
  - If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now \(\text{lex} - 2\).
  - If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, `lex` is now \(\text{lex} - 27\).
  - If the initial `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is now \(\text{lex} - 52\).
- `k` is 2.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
- `k` is 2, so `arr[k]` refers to the third element in `arr`, which is `lex`.
- The `chr()` function converts an ASCII value to its corresponding character.
- The expression `arr[k] + 96` translates to `lex + 96`.

Given the adjustments to `lex`:
- If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now \(\text{lex} - 2\). Therefore, `lex + 96` becomes \((\text{lex} - 2) + 96 = \text{lex} + 94\).
- If the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, `lex` is now \(\text{lex} - 27\). Therefore, `lex + 96` becomes \((\text{lex} - 27) + 96 = \text{lex} + 69\).
- If the initial `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is now \(\text{lex} - 52\). Therefore, `lex + 96` becomes \((\text{lex} - 52) + 96 = \text{lex} + 44\).

However, since `lex` is adjusted to fit within the range of 1 to 26 (after the adjustment), the adjusted `lex` will always be between 1 and 26. Therefore, the expression `lex + 96` will always result in a value between 97 and 122, which correspond to the ASCII values for the lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the character corresponding to the ASCII value `lex + 96`, where `lex` is the adjusted value of `lex` (which is between 1 and 26).

Output: **character (where character is the ASCII character corresponding to lex + 96, and lex is the adjusted value of lex between 1 and 26)**
