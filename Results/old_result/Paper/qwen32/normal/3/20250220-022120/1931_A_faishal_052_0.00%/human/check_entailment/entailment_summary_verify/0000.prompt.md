You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 78) and prints three characters based on the value of `n`. The characters are derived by converting certain values to letters from 'a' to 'z'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem description. Specifically, the logic for distributing the sum among the three letters is flawed, and it does not ensure that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

For the input `n = 70`, the program should output `rzz` because:
- The sum of the positions of the letters in `rzz` is 18 (r) + 26 (z) + 26 (z) = 70.
- `rzz` is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 70.

However, the provided program does not correctly compute this. The logic in the program attempts to distribute the sum by first filling the first two positions with either 1 or 26 and then assigning the remaining sum to the third position. This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

For instance, with `n = 70`, the program might end up with something like `[26, 26, 18]` and then sort it to `[18, 26, 26]`, which would correspond to the word `rzz`. But the program's current logic might not handle this correctly due to its fixed distribution strategy.

To ensure correctness, the program should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter accordingly to meet the sum requirement. This approach would ensure that the word is lexicographically smallest.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters
        a = 1
        b = 1
        c = lex - a - b
        # Adjust the second letter if necessary
        if c > 26:
            b += c - 26
            c = 26
        # Adjust the first letter if necessary
        if b > 26:
            a += b - 26
            b = 26
        # Print the resulting word
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest for any valid input within the given constraints.
