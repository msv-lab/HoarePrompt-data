Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is less than or equal to 26.**

In natural language: The value of `arr` has been updated to include the integer `1`, making `arr` equal to `[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
