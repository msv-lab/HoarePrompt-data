Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Letters**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the letters based on the remaining value after subtracting 26. It should ensure that the third letter is also between 1 and 26.
   - The program does not handle cases where the remaining value after the first two letters is less than 1 or more than 26 correctly.

2. **Sorting the Letters**:
   - Sorting the letters after assigning values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. The program should assign the smallest possible values to the first letters first to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the sum is exactly 3 (all 'a's) or other minimal sums correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        lex -= 3  # Subtract the initial sum of 'aaa'
        
        # Distribute the remaining value to b and c
        if lex > 0:
            b += min(lex, 25)  # Add up to 25 to b
            lex -= min(lex, 25)
        if lex > 0:
            c += lex  # Add the remaining to c
        
        # Convert to letters
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the letters are assigned in a way that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.
