Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1], and `lex` is an integer such that -1 <= lex <= 24 if it was originally between 0 and 25, or `lex` is an integer greater than 24 if it was originally greater than 25.**

In simpler terms, `lex` is decremented by 1, so if `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, it is now between -1 and 24. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, it remains greater than 24. All other variables remain unchanged.
