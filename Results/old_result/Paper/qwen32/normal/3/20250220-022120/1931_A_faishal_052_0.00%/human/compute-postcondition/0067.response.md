Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is now `lex` minus 26. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is [1, 26] and `lex` is now less than or equal to 0. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is now less than 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is now 26 or greater but less than 52.**

In simpler terms, the variable `lex` has been reduced by 26. Depending on its original value, `lex` could now be less than or equal to 0, less than 26, or between 26 and 52. The array `arr` remains [1, 26] if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, and [26, 26] otherwise. Other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.
