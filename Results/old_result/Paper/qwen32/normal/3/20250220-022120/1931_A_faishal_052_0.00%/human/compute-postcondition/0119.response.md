The provided code snippet appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can be one of four possible lists: `[1, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]`. After appending `26` to `arr`, the new possible values of `arr` will be `[1, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`. The values of other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], [26, 1, 26], or [26, 26, 26]. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 26] and `lex` is unchanged. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1, 26] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than 25 after the if-else block, `arr` is [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26, 26]. If `lex` was originally greater than -1, `arr` is [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
