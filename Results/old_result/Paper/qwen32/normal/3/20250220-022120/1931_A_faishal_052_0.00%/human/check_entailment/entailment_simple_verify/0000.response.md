### Reasoning:
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and behavior against the problem requirements. The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums to a given integer `n`.

#### Original Program Analysis:
1. **Logic for Distributing the Sum:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr`.
   - It then iterates twice, checking if the remaining sum (`lex`) is less than or equal to 26. If so, it appends 1 to `arr` and reduces `lex` by 1. Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted, and the program prints the corresponding letters by converting each number to its corresponding character.

2. **Issues in the Logic:**
   - The logic for distributing the sum does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. By starting with the maximum possible values (26) for the first two letters, the program may not find the smallest possible letters for the first two positions.
   - For example, if `lex` is 70, the program might end up with `[26, 26, 18]`, which, when sorted, becomes `[18, 26, 26]` corresponding to `rzz`. However, the program's logic might not handle this correctly due to its fixed distribution strategy.
   - The program does not ensure that the first two letters are as small as possible before adjusting the third letter.

#### Corrected Program Analysis:
The corrected version of the program starts by assigning the smallest possible values (1) to the first two letters and then adjusts the third letter accordingly. This ensures that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `a` and `b` to 1 (smallest possible values for the first two letters).
   - Calculate `c` as `lex - a - b`.
   
2. **Adjustments:**
   - If `c` is greater than 26, increment `b` by `c - 26` and set `c` to 26.
   - If `b` is greater than 26, increment `a` by `b - 26` and set `b` to 26.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the letters corresponding to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly handle all potential cases due to its fixed distribution strategy, which does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word. The corrected version addresses these issues by starting with the smallest possible values and adjusting as necessary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all possible inputs.
