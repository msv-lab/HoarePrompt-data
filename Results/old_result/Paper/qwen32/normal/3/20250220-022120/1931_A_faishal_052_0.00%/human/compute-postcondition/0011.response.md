Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is an input integer greater than 0 but less than 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, so if `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, after the operation, `lex` will be greater than 0 but less than 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
