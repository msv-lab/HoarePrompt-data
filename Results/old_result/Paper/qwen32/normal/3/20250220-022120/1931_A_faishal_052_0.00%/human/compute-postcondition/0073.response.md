The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex` remain unchanged. The new value of `arr` will depend on its original state before the append operation.

- If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` was either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`. After appending `26`, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 26]` or `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` was `[26, 1]` or `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`. After appending `26`, `arr` will be `[26, 1, 26]` or `[1, 26, 26]` or `[26, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` was `[26, 1]` or `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`. After appending `26`, `arr` will be `[26, 1, 26]` or `[1, 26, 26]` or `[26, 26, 26]`.

The adjusted value of `lex` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value, and `arr` is either `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 26, 26]`.**
