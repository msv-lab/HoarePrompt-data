The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\) and `n` is an input integer. 
2. The code snippet provided is `print('NO')`.
3. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `t` or `n`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
