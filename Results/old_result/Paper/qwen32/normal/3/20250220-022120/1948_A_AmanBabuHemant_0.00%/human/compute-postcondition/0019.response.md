Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is the string `'110'` repeated \((n // 2)\) times.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`:** The value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, it does not affect the output.
2. **Variable `n`:** This is an input integer, and its exact value is not specified. However, it is used to determine the value of `s`.
3. **Variable `s`:** This variable is a string that consists of the substring `'110'` repeated \((n // 2)\) times. The `//` operator denotes integer division, which means it performs division and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `s` depends on the value of `n // 2`.
- Since `n` is not specified, we can only describe `s` in terms of `n`.

### Description of `s`:
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer, and `s` will be the string `'110'` repeated that many times.
- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will still be an integer (since it rounds down), and `s` will be the string `'110'` repeated that many times.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `n = 4`, then `n // 2 = 2`, and `s` will be `'110110'`.
- If `n = 5`, then `n // 2 = 2`, and `s` will also be `'110110'`.
- If `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`, and `s` will be `'110110110'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(s)` statement will be the string `'110'` repeated \((n // 2)\) times. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **'110' repeated (n // 2) times (where n is the input integer)**
