You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring '110' `n // 2` times and checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If so, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to create a string of uppercase Latin letters where there are exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Analyzing the given program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd. If it is, the program outputs "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string of uppercase Latin letters under the given definition.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times and checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If so, it outputs "YES" followed by the constructed string. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

3. **Evaluating the logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters is impossible and outputs "NO" in such cases.
   - However, the constructed string `s` uses the characters '1', '1', and '0', which are not uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem.
   - The pattern '110' does not satisfy the condition of having exactly `n` special characters in the string. For example, in the string '110110', the characters '1' and '0' do not meet the criteria of being equal to exactly one of their neighbors.
   - The problem requires the string to consist of uppercase Latin letters, but the program uses digits instead.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not generate a valid string of uppercase Latin letters that meets the problem's requirements.
   - The logic for constructing the string needs to be revised to use uppercase Latin letters and ensure that the string has exactly `n` special characters.
