Reasoning:
The program's logic is flawed based on the problem description. The program checks if `n` is even and constructs a string `s` by repeating '110' `n // 2` times. However, the string `s` should consist of uppercase Latin letters, not digits. Additionally, the string `s` is checked for a length less than 200, which is unnecessary because the length of the string `s` will always be `3 * (n // 2)`, which is at most `3 * 25 = 75` for `n` up to 50, well within the 200-character limit.

The program should construct the string using uppercase Latin letters and correctly identify special characters. A correct approach would be to construct a string like "ABA" repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even, or handle the case where `n` is odd.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'ABA' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

# Example usage
# Input:
# 3
# 6
# 1
# 2
# Output:
# YES
# ABAABA
# NO
# YES
# ABA
```

Since the given program does not meet the requirements and constructs an invalid string, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
