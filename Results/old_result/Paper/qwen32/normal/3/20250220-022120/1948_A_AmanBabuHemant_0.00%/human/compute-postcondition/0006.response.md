The code snippet assigns the variable `s` the value of the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. Given that `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50; `n` is an even input integer; `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times**.
