Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, `same` is 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `same` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
