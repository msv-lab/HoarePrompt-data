Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. If it is impossible to do so, it should return -1.

The program iterates through the array and counts the lengths of contiguous segments of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum length of these segments. If the minimum length is infinite (which should not happen since we are guaranteed the array is beautiful and thus has at least one segment), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these segments.

### Analysis

The logic here seems flawed. The minimum segment length is not necessarily the number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Consider the following counterexample:

#### Counterexample:
Input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation: Removing one element (e.g., the second 1) results in an array `[1, 2, 2, 1]` which is not beautiful.

However, the program will output `2` because the minimum segment length in this array is `2` (the segments are `[1], [2], [1], [2], [1]`).

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. It incorrectly assumes that the minimum segment length is the answer, which is not always the case.

### Explanation of the Flaw
The program's approach does not account for the fact that removing elements from a segment might not necessarily break the "beautiful" property if there are multiple segments of the same length. It also does not consider the possibility that removing elements from different segments might be necessary to achieve the desired result.
