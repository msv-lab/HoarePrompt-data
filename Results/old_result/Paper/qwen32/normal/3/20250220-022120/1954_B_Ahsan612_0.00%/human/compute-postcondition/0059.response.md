Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
