Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4 or 5. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**
