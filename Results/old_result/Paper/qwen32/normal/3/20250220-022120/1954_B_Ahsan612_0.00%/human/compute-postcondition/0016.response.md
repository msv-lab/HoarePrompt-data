The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is either 1 or 2, after incrementing, `i` will be 2 if it was 1, or `i` will be 3 if it was 2. However, since the initial condition specifies `i` can only be 1 or 2, and `i` cannot be 3 after the increment, `i` must have been 1 initially and is now 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, `same`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `minn` is either inf or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` becomes `ar[2]`, `minn` becomes 1, and `i` becomes 2.**
