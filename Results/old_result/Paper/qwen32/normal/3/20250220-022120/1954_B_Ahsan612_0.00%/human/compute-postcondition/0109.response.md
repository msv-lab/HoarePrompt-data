The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` will update the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t-1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4
- `i` is either 4 or 5
- If `i` is 4, then `num` is the first element of `ar`; if `i` is 5, then `num` is `ar[3]`
- `minn` is `inf` or 2
- `same` is 3 or 1

After the code execution, `minn` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`. 

Let's consider the possible values:
- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is 3, `minn` becomes 3.
- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is 1, `minn` becomes 1.
- If `minn` is 2 and `same` is 3, `minn` remains 2.
- If `minn` is 2 and `same` is 1, `minn` becomes 1.

Therefore, the updated value of `minn` will be either 1 or 2, depending on the initial values of `minn` and `same`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4, `i` is either 4 or 5, if `i` is 4 then `num` is the first element of `ar`, if `i` is 5 then `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or 2, `same` is 3 or 1.**
