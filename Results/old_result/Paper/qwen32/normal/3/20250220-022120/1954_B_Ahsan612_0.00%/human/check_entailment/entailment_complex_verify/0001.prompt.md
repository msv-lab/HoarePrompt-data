You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

    #State: The program prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements for each of the `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements in the array. If no such elements exist, it prints `-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) and a list of integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\). It then attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the number of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the last counted sequence of identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there was no sequence of identical elements, and the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The program's logic is incorrect. The variable `minn` is supposed to find the minimum length of sequences of identical elements, but it does not correctly account for all sequences. It only considers sequences that end when a different element is encountered. It does not handle the case where the entire array is a single sequence of identical elements correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the entire array is a single sequence of identical elements. In such cases, it should output `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- **Final Update**: The final update of `minn` is necessary, but the logic around it is flawed, as it does not correctly reflect the minimum sequence length in all scenarios.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
