The given code snippet only initializes the variable `i` to 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is inf; `i` is 1.**
