Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
