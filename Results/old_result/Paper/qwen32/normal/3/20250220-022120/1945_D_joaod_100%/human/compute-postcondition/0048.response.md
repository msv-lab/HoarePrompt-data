To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step-by-step:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `na_frente` is set to 1.
   - `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to 0.
   - `best` is the smallest total cost encountered that includes the cost of switching at a position less than or equal to `pos_final`.

2. **Understanding `best`**:
   - `best` is defined as the smallest total cost encountered that includes the cost of switching at a position less than or equal to `pos_final`. This suggests that the program is likely iterating through a series of positions and calculating costs based on switching at different points, and keeping track of the minimum cost encountered up to `pos_final`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(best)` statement will output the value of `best`, which is the smallest total cost encountered that includes the cost of switching at a position less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Given the information provided, the exact numerical value of `best` cannot be determined without the specific input values for `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `pos_final`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `best` value.

Output: **best (where best is the smallest total cost encountered that includes the cost of switching at a position less than or equal to `pos_final`)**
