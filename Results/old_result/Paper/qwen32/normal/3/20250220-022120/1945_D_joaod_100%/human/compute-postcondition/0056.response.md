Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `c` is the next integer in the range(cases)**

In this output state, the variable `best` has been updated to the maximum possible float value as defined by `sys.float_info.max`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
