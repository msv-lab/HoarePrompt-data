Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is the next integer in the range(cases), `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural language: The value of `best` has been updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
