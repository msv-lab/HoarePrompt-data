Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Additionally, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is greater than the current value of `best`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is set to `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`; otherwise, `total` is set to `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.**
