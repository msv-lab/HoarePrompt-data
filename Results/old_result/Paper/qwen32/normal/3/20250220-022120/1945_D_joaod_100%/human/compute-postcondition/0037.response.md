Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `v` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that all the initial conditions remain the same except for the new variable `best`, which is calculated as the sum of `total` and the first element of the `custo_pra_trocar_a` list (since `v` is 0).
