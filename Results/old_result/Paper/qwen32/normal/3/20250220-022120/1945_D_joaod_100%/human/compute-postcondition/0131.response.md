The only variable in the loop head is `v`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `na_frente` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` was decremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `v` should be set to the value it had at the start of the last iteration, which is `na_frente - 1` plus 1, or simply `na_frente`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers obtained from the new input, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `na_frente`.**
