Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In natural language: The value of `total` is now equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
