The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. The variables `t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers obtained from the input; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
