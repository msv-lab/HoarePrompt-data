For the given task, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop head in this case is `c in range(cases)`. Therefore, the variables `c` and `cases` are the ones we can adjust.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `cases`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `cases` is described as an input integer representing the number of test cases, it should already be set to a value that makes sense for the problem context. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `cases` is at least 1.

2. **Variable `c`:** This variable is the loop counter and is automatically initialized by the `range` function in Python. Before the loop starts, `c` is not explicitly defined, but its initial value will be the starting value of the range, which is 0. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `c` before the loop starts, as it will be correctly initialized by the `range` function.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `cases` is at least 1. The value of `t` is not relevant to the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**
