Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the smallest total cost encountered that includes the cost of switching at a position less than or equal to `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to `0`, `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` that are less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `c` is the next integer in the range(cases).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers obtained from the new input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum total cost encountered when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`, `c` is `c + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
