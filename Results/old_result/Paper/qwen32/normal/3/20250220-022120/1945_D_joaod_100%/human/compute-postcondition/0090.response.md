The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the variable `total`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `v` is defined as `na_frente - 2`, the value being added to `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the next integer in the range(cases), `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.**
