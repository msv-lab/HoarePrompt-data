Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, and `c` is `c + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `best` has been updated to `sys.float_info.max`, which is the largest possible float value in Python. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
