Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is `len(s) - 2`, `mi` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 2, and `l` is an empty list. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the control flow by exiting the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
