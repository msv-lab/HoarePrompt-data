Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not account for the correct segment that needs to be painted.

The function `func_1` attempts to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string and returns the length of the segment between these two occurrences plus two. However, this approach does not necessarily give the minimum segment length that would turn all cells white. 

For example, in the first test case "WBBWBW", the function might incorrectly return 4 (considering the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B'), but the correct answer is also 4, which could be obtained by painting the segment from the second 'B' to the fifth 'B'. The function does not consider all possible segments that could turn all cells white and select the shortest one.

A correct approach would involve finding the longest continuous segment of 'B's and considering that as the segment to be painted, as this would minimize the length of the segment needed to turn all cells white.
