Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is the number of test cases, and `s` is the input string. `c` is 0, `d` is 0, and `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in s:
    c += 1
    if j == 'B':
        mi = c
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 1 if `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the first character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 2 if `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the second character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 3 if `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
