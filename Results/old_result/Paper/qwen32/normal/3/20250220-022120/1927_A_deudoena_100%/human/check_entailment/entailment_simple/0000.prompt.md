Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', ma is 0, mi is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in s, m is the number of test cases, c is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in s, d is 0, and l is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: - `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `s` remains the same.
    #- `ma` is set to the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string.
    #- `mi` remains the same.
    #- `m` remains the same.
    #- `c` remains the same.
    #- `d` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #- `l` remains an empty list.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop has executed all necessary iterations, the variable `ma` will hold the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `s`, and `d` will reflect how many characters from the end of the string were checked before finding the first 'B'. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `s`, and `mi` remains unchanged.
