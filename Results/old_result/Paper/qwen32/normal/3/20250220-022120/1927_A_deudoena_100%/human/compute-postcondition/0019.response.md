Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 3, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the third character of `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement only affects the control flow by exiting the most internal loop or if statement. None of the variables' values are changed by this statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is the control flow, which is indicated by breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
