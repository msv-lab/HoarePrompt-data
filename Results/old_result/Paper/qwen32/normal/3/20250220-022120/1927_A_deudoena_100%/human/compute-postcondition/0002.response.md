The code `s = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This line of input is expected to be a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. The values of `t`, `ma`, `mi`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is the number of test cases, and `s` is the input string.**
