You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', ma is 0, mi is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in s, m is the number of test cases, c is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in s, d is 0, and l is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: - `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `s` remains the same.
    #- `ma` is set to the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string.
    #- `mi` remains the same.
    #- `m` remains the same.
    #- `c` remains the same.
    #- `d` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #- `l` remains an empty list.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop has executed all necessary iterations, the variable `ma` will hold the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `s`, and `d` will reflect how many characters from the end of the string were checked before finding the first 'B'. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `s`, and `mi` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of the strip and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `s`, and `mi` remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `s`, and `mi` remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
