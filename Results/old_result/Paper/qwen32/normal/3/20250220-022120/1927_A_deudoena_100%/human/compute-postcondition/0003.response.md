The code snippet provided initializes two variables `c` and `d` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, `mi`, or `m`. The only change is the introduction of `c` and `d` with the value 0.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is the number of test cases, and `s` is the input string. `c` is 0, `d` is 0.**
