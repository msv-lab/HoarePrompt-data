Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is the number of test cases, and `s` is the input string. `c` is 0, `d` is 0, and `l` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that a new variable `l` is introduced and is initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their original values.
