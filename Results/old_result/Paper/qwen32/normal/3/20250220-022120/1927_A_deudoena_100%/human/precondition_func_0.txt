The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.
