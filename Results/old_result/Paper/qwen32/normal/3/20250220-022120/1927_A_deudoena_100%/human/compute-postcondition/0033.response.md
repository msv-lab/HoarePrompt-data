The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is the loop variable iterating over the reversed string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `j` to the next character in the reversed string `s`.

Given:
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the current character being processed in the reversed string `s`.

Let's denote the current index of `j` in the reversed string as `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `s[n-k-1]`. For the next iteration, `j` should be `s[n-(k+1)-1] = s[n-k-2]`.

Since `j` is the loop variable, it is directly tied to the iteration over `s[::-1]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the next character in the reversed string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `mi` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 2, and `l` is an empty list. If the character `j` is 'B', then `ma` is set to `len(s) - 2` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ma` remains 0. `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s`**.
