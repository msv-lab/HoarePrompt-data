To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it interacts with the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx`.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `mex` and prints it. The variables `minn` and `maxx` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

Given that the loop prints each element of `mex`, after all iterations, the entire list `mex` will have been printed.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

Output State: **All elements of `mex` are printed, separated by spaces. `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will print every integer in the list `mex`, one by one, separated by spaces. The values of `minn` and `maxx` will not be altered by the loop.
