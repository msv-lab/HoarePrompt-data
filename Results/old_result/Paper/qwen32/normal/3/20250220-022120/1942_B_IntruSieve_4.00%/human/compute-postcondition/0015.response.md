The value of `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. Given that `minn` is 0 and `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, the expression `abs(arr[i] - minn)` simplifies to `abs(arr[i])`. Since `arr[i]` is non-positive, `abs(arr[i])` is the negation of `arr[i]` or simply `-arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[i])`; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is `-arr[i]`; `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0; the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**
