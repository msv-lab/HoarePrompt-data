Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is a list containing the integer 0; `minn` is 1; `maxx` is 0. The current element `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
