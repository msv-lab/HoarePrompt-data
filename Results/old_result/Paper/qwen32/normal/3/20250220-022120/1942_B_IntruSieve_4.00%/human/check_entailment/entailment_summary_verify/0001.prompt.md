You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a list `mex` of `n` integers based on specific rules involving positive and non-positive numbers in the input list. Each test case results in a new line of output containing the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to construct a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) where each element \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX (minimum excludant) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list, intended to store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` is supposed to keep track of the smallest unused number, and `maxx` is supposed to keep track of the largest number in the `mex` list.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element in the input array `arr`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and then increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again. This logic seems flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the MEX calculation.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the appended value is greater than `maxx`. This approach doesn't align with the problem's requirement to calculate the MEX.

### Flaws in the Program
- The program does not correctly calculate the MEX for each prefix of the permutation. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`, which is not what the program does.
- The logic for handling positive and non-positive values of `arr[i]` does not align with the problem's definition of how `a_i` is calculated from `p_i`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.
2. For each element in `arr`, calculate the MEX of the current set of used numbers.
3. Determine `p_i` as `MEX - arr[i]`.
4. Ensure `p_i` is a valid number (i.e., not already used and within the range [0, n-1]).
5. Add `p_i` to the set of used numbers and the permutation `p`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to construct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.
