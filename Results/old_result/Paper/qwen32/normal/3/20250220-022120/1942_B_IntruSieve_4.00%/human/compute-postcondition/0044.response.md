Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- We are told that "All elements of `mex` are printed, separated by spaces."
- It's also mentioned that `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged, but they are not involved in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print()
```

### Analysis:
- The `print()` function in Python, when called without any arguments, outputs a newline character.
- There is no mention of any variables or objects being printed in the `print()` statement.
- The precondition states that the elements of `mex` are printed, but this is not part of the provided code snippet. The code snippet only contains an empty `print()` statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the code snippet `print()`, the output will be a newline character.

### Output:
Output: **(newline)**

To make it clear in the required format:
Output: **(newline)**
