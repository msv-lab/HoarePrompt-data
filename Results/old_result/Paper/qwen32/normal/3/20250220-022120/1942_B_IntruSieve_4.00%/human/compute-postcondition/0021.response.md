The code snippet `minn = maxx + 1` updates the value of `minn` to be `maxx + 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `mex` has an additional element which is the value of `minn` (before the update); `minn` is `maxx + 1`.**
