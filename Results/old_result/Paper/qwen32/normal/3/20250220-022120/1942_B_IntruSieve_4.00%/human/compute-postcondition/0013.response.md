The code snippet appends the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list. Given that `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0 and `minn` is 0, the expression `abs(arr[i] - minn)` simplifies to `abs(arr[i])`, which is the non-negative value of `arr[i]`.

Therefore, the value of `mex` will be updated to include this new element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[i])`; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0; `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0**.
