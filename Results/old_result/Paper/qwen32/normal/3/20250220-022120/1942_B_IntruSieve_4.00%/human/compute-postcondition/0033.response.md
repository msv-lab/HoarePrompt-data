Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 2`; `mex` has a new element which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`; `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `maxx` is now equal to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. All other variables retain their previous values.
