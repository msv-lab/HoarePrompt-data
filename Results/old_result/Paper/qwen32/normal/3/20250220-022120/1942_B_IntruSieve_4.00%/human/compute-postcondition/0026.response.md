Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 1`. If `arr[i] > 0`, then if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `mex` has an additional element which is the value of `minn` (before the update), and `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`; otherwise, `mex` and `minn` remain unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, then `mex` contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`; otherwise, `maxx` retains its original value.**
