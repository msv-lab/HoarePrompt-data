The only variable in the loop head is `itm` from the list `mex`. Therefore, we need to adjust `itm` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than the current index of `itm` + 1. This means that for the loop to execute again, `itm` must be updated to the next element in the list `mex`.

The variables `minn` and `maxx` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted in this step.

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than the current index of `itm` + 2, `minn` is the final count of positive numbers in `arr` (adjusted by the rule that if `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments by 1), and `maxx` is the maximum absolute difference between any non-positive `arr[i]` and the current `minn`**
