The code snippet `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` calculates the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and appends this value to the list `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i` are not directly modified by this line of code, but `mex` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `mex` contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
