Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \). Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( \text{MEX} \)**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the \( \text{MEX} \) of the array \( p \) up to the current index \( i \). It does not properly track the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in the constructed \( p \) up to index \( i \).
   - The program uses `minn` to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used, but it does not correctly handle the case when `arr[i]` is negative or when the smallest unused integer changes due to the values of `arr[i]`.

2. **Handling Negative Values in \( a \)**:
   - The program incorrectly handles negative values in \( a \). For negative values, it calculates the element of \( p \) as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which is not the correct approach to determine the \( \text{MEX} \).

3. **Updating `minn` and `maxx`**:
   - The program updates `minn` and `maxx` in a way that does not ensure the correct \( \text{MEX} \) is calculated. Specifically, `minn` is incremented only when `arr[i]` is positive, which is not a reliable method to track the smallest unused integer.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The program's output might be something like:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program might not correctly handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative, leading to incorrect values in the permutation \( p \).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly construct the permutation \( p \), we need to:
1. Track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \).
2. For each element \( a_i \), determine the corresponding \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
3. Use a set or a boolean array to efficiently track which integers have been used in \( p \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 0
    used = set()
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p_i = mex - arr[i]
        used.add(p_i)
        p.append(p_i)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the \( \text{MEX} \) is correctly calculated and that each element of \( p \) is properly determined based on the given \( a \).
