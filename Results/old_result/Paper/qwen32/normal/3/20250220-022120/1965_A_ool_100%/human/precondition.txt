arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each element in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, with the total number of piles across all test cases not exceeding 2·10^5.
