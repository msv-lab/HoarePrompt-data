Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]); if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `not_c` remains True; `i` is 2.**

In simple terms, the value of `A` has been toggled to `False`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
