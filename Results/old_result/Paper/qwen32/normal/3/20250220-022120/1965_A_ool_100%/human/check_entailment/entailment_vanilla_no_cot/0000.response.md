Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The logic in the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the game's mechanics or apply the optimal strategy for both players.

The key to solving this problem is to recognize that it is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a mis√®re Nim game where the player who cannot make a move loses. In standard Nim, the player who can make the last move wins, but here, the player who cannot make a move wins.

In this game, the crucial observation is that the game's outcome depends on the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of such piles is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because each move reduces the number of piles with an odd number of stones by an even number, and the player who faces a situation with an even number of such piles will eventually lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    odd_count = sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 == 1)
    if odd_count % 2 == 1:
        print("Alice")
    else:
        print("Bob")
```

This corrected version counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.
