The given Python code snippet only assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `A`. No other variables are mentioned or modified in the code snippet. Therefore, the state of the `arr` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is False.**
