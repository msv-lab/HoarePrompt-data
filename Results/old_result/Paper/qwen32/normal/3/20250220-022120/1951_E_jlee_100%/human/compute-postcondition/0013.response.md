Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is the input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `x` is `s[0]`. The first character `x` of `s` is not equal to the last character `s[-1]`.
   - The state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(1)`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(1)` directly prints the integer `1`.
   - The variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `done` do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The print statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the print statement is `print(1)`, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
