To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **i**: Set to the integer value 2. This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
3. **string**: The newly input string. This is a string that has been inputted, but its specific value is not provided.
4. **s**: A list of characters from the newly input string `string`. This is essentially the string `string` split into individual characters.
5. **n**: The length of the list `s`, which is the length of the string `string`.
6. **x**: The first character of the string `string`, which is `s[0]`.
7. **j**: Set to the integer value `n`, which is the length of the string `string`.
8. **count** and **count2**: These variables are set based on loop conditions but are not directly used in the provided code snippet.
9. **done**: A boolean variable set to False. The condition `not done` is true, but this variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(string)
```

### What Will Be Printed:
The `print(string)` statement will print the value of the variable `string`. Since the exact value of `string` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as the newly input string.

### Final Output:
Output: **string (where string is the newly input string)**
