Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
