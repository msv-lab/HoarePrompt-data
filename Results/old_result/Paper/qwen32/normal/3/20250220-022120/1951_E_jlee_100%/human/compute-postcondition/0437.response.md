Postcondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; i is 2; string is the newly input string; s is a list of characters from the newly input string; n is the length of s; x is s[0]; j is n; count is the number of characters not equal to x before the first occurrence of a different character; count2 is the number of characters not equal to x after the first occurrence of a different character; done is False; and the condition not done is true. The current value of done is False, and the program has entered the if condition where not done is true.**
