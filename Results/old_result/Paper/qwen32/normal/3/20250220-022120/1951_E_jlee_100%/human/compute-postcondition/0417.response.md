Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: An integer set to 2.
3. **`string`**: A newly input string.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from the newly input string.
5. **`n`**: The length of the string `s`, and it is greater than 4.
6. **`x`**: The first character of the string `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
7. **`j`**: An integer set to 4.
8. **`count2`**: An integer that is greater than or equal to 0.
9. **`count`**: An integer set to 4.
10. **Condition**: If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count2` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It does not depend on the values of any variables or the conditions mentioned in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is a literal and will be printed exactly as it is.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
