Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 0; `done` is True if `s[j] != x`, otherwise `done` remains False; if `s[j] != x` and `count2` is less than `count`, then `count2` remains less than `count` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `s[j] != x` and `count2` equals `count`, then `count2` remains equal to `count` and `count` is set to 1 if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is set to 0; if `s[j] != x` and `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count2` remains greater than `count`; if `s[j] == x`, then `count2` is set to 1.**
