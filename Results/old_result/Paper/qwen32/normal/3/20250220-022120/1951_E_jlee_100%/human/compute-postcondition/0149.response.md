Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is False; `count` and `count2` are the values after the last iteration. Additionally, `done` is currently False, allowing the entry into the if statement.**
