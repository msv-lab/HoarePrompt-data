Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
            continue
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is False; `count` and `count2` are the values after the last iteration. Additionally, since `done` is currently False, the if statement is executed, and `done` remains False. There is no else part to consider.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `n`; `count` and `count2` are set based on the loop conditions; `done` is False; and the condition `not done` is true. Since the else part is not present, there are no additional changes if `done` were to be true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `n`; `count` is the number of characters not equal to `x` before the first occurrence of a different character; `count2` is the number of characters not equal to `x` after the first occurrence of a different character; `done` is False; and the condition not `done` is true. The program has entered the if condition where `not done` is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
