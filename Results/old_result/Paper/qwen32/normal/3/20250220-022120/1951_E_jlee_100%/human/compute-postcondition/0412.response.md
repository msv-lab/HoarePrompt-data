Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and their states**:
   - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases. The range of `t` is 1 to 10,000.
   - `i`: Set to 2.
   - `string`: A newly input string.
   - `s`: A list of characters from the newly input string.
   - `n`: Greater than 4, indicating the length of the string `string` is greater than 4.
   - `x`: The first character of the string `string` (i.e., `s[0]`).
   - `j`: Set to 4.
   - `count2`: Greater than or equal to 0.
   - `count`: Set to 4.
   - `done`: This variable is set to `True` and a loop is broken if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

2. **Condition**:
   - The condition `if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j]` determines whether the variable `done` is set to `True` and a loop is broken. However, this condition does not affect the `print('YES')` statement directly.

3. **Print statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables' values. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Based on this analysis, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
