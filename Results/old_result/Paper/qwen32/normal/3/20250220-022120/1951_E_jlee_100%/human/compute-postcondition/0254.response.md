Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` was equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count` was greater than 1, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `s[j]` remains `x`. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` or `done`. `j` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` equals 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` does not equal `count`, then if `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
