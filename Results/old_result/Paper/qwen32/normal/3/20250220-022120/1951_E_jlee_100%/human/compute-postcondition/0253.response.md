Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. If `count2` equals `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` equals 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` does not equal `count`, then if `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
