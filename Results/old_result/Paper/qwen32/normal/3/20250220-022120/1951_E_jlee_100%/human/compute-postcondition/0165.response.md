Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is False; `count` and `count2` are the values after the last iteration. If `n` is equal to 1, the program maintains the same state as described. If `x` is not equal to `s[-1]`, the program maintains the same state as described. Otherwise, the program maintains the same state as described.**

Since the else part does not modify any variables, the overall postcondition is the same as the precondition for both cases where `x != s[-1]` and `x == s[-1]`.
