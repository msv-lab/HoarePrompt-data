Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `n`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `done` is False; and the condition `not done` is true. If `n` equals 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `x` is not equal to `s[-1]`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]` and `s.count(x) == n`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]` and `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than or equal to 0; `count2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and if `count2` is less than `count`, the loop breaks; if `count2` equals `count`, `count` is set to 1 if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is set to 0; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `count2` remains greater than `count`; if `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is set to 1. If `count` is 0, `done` remains False and `count2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 3; `count2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or if `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 4; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 4; and `count2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 0, the behavior depends on the comparison between `s[j]` and `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is reset to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. Additionally, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` at any point, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
