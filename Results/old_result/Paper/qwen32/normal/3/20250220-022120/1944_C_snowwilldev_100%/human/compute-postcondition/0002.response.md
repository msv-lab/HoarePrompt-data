The given code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with the default factory function `int`. This means that any key that does not exist in the dictionary will have a default value of 0 when accessed.

The initial state tells us that `N` is assigned the value of the first integer input, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the next input line. These variables are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the next input line; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`.**
