Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Key Observations:

1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she would try to include as many smaller numbers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he would try to avoid letting Alice include smaller numbers in `c`.

### Strategy:

- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in the array `a`, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 2 by picking one of these numbers on her first turn and then allowing Bob to pick the other.
- If there is only one number that appears exactly once, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 1.
- If there are no numbers that appear exactly once, the MEX will be 0 because all numbers from 0 to `n-1` will be included in `c` at some point.

### Program Analysis:

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

1. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
   
2. **Finding the MEX**:
   - It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N` and counts how many numbers appear exactly once.
   - If it finds two numbers that appear exactly once, it returns the current number `i` as the MEX.
   - If it finds a number that does not appear in `a`, it also returns the current number `i` as the MEX.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program aligns with the strategy discussed above. Here's why:

- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, the program will return the smallest such number, ensuring the MEX is at least 2.
- If there is only one number that appears exactly once, the program will return that number, ensuring the MEX is at least 1.
- If there are no numbers that appear exactly once, the program will return 0, which is the MEX when all numbers from 0 to `n-1` are included.

The program handles all edge cases and correctly determines the MEX based on the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
