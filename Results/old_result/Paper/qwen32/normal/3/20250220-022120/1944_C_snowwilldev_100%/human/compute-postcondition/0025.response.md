Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`, `i` is 3. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `cnt[i]` remains 1 and the program does not return. Otherwise, the program returns 2 if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. The state of `N`, `a`, `i`, and `t` remains unchanged in all cases.**
