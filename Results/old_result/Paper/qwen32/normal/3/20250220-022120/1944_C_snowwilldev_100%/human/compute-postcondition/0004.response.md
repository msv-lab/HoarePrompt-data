The code snippet increments the count of `a[i]` in the `cnt` defaultdict by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int` and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
