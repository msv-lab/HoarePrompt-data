The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` and then determining the smallest non-negative integer that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all. However, the logic in the program does not fully align with the optimal strategy for both players.

Let's analyze the problem in detail:

1. **Alice's Goal:** Maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal:** Minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. To maximize the MEX, Alice would ideally want to include as many consecutive integers starting from 0 as possible. Conversely, Bob would want to prevent this by strategically removing elements that Alice might choose.

The provided function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each integer in the array and then iterates through the integers starting from 0. It returns the first integer that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all. However, this approach does not consider the strategic choices that Alice and Bob would make during the game.

Here's a more strategic approach:
- If an integer `i` appears an even number of times, Alice and Bob can completely remove all occurrences of `i` from the game without affecting the MEX (they can just cancel each other out).
- If an integer `i` appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure that at least one `i` remains in the final array `c` by choosing it on her turn when Bob has no choice but to remove a different number.

Given this, the correct strategy is to find the smallest integer `i` that appears an odd number of times in the array `a`. This integer `i` will be part of the final array `c` if both players play optimally, and thus it will be the MEX of `c`.

Let's correct the function based on this understanding:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] % 2 == 1:
            return i
        
    return N  # This line is theoretically unreachable because the problem guarantees that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and there will always be some integer with an odd count.

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

Since the provided function does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.

Reasoning: The provided function does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It does not consider the parity (odd/even count) of each integer in the array, which is crucial for determining the MEX based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **False**
