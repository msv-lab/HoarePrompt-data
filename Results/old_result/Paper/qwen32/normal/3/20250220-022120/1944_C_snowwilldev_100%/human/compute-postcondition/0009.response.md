Output State: **`N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `i` is `N-1` after the final iteration, `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int` where each key in `cnt` corresponds to an integer in `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `N` remains the number of elements in the list `a`. The variable `i` will have the value of `N-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `N-1`. The list `a` remains unchanged, still holding the original integers. The `cnt` dictionary will have keys that are the unique integers from the list `a`, and each key's value will be the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
