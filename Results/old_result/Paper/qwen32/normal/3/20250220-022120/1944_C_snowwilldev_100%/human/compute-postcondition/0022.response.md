Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`, `i` is 2, and `cnt[i]` is 1. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the program returns 2. Otherwise, the program does not return and the state of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t` remains unchanged.**
