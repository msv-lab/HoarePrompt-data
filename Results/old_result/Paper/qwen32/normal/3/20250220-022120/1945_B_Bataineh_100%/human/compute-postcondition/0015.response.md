Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the condition `m < a and m < b` holds true. Otherwise, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b` (or both). If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the condition `m < a and m > b` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `m < a and m > b` does not hold true. If `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, the condition `m < b and m > a` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `m < b and m > a` does not hold true.**

To simplify, the postcondition can be stated as:

Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `m < a and m < b`. Otherwise, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b` (or both).**
