Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the integer input. The constraints on `t` remain the same. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are not affected by this input operation.
