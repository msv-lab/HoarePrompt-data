To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\).
- The conditions given are:
  1. Either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b` (or both).
  2. It is not the case that `m` is less than `a` and `m` is greater than `b`.
  3. It is not true that `m` is less than `b` and `m` is greater than `a`.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is `m // a + m // b + 2`. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **`m // a`**: This is the integer division of `m` by `a`, which gives the number of times `a` fits into `m` without exceeding it.
2. **`m // b`**: This is the integer division of `m` by `b`, which gives the number of times `b` fits into `m` without exceeding it.
3. **`+ 2`**: This simply adds 2 to the sum of the two integer divisions.

### Conditions Analysis:
Given the conditions:
- If `m` is not less than `a`, then `m // a` will be at least 1.
- If `m` is not less than `b`, then `m // b` will be at least 1.
- The conditions ensure that `m` is not between `a` and `b` in such a way that `m // a` and `m // b` would both be zero, which is not possible under the given constraints.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`**: Both `m // a` and `m // b` will be at least 1, so the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` will be at least 4.
2. **If `m` is equal to `a` and less than `b`**: `m // a` will be 1 and `m // b` will be 0, but this scenario is not possible due to the given conditions.
3. **If `m` is equal to `b` and less than `a`**: `m // a` will be 0 and `m // b` will be 1, but this scenario is also not possible due to the given conditions.
4. **If `m` is equal to `a` and equal to `b`**: `m // a` and `m // b` will both be 1, so the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` will be 4.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the minimum value the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` can take is 4, and it will be greater than or equal to 4 based on the constraints.

Therefore, the output will be a value that is at least 4, but the exact value depends on the specific values of `m`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m // a is the integer division of m by a, and m // b is the integer division of m by b)**
