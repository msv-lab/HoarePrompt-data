Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is incorrect and does not account for the overlaps between the fireworks launched by the two installations.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the time intervals when fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals `a` and `b` and then calculating how many fireworks from each installation are visible within a certain period, taking into account their visibility duration `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab)
        if m % a == 0:
            max_fireworks += 1
        if m % b == 0:
            max_fireworks += 1
        if m % lcm_ab == 0:
            max_fireworks -= 1
        print(max_fireworks + 1)

func()
```

In this corrected program:
- We calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
- We then count the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m`.
- We adjust for the overlaps by subtracting the fireworks launched at the LCM interval.
- Finally, we add 1 to the result to account for the fireworks launched at time 0.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.
