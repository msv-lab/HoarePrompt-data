To ensure the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the `range(1, n)` will generate at least one iteration if `n` is at least 2.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute because `range(1, n)` will be empty.

2. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts. It will be initialized to 1 in the first iteration of the loop.

3. **Other Variables:** The other variables mentioned (`maxi` and `arr`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop. They are part of the program state but do not affect whether the loop will run or not.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[0]`.**
