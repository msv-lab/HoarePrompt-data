Postcondition: ***The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[0]`; `res` is the value of the input string.***
