To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`n`**: It is mentioned that `n` is greater than `i`. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided.
2. **`res`**: This variable is described as the value of the new user's input. The exact value of `res` is not relevant to the `print` statement provided.
3. **`i`**: It is mentioned that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The exact value of `i` before the increment is not provided, but after the increment, it will be `i + 1`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- **`maxi`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value. However, it will be printed as is.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` will be printed twice. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement, the value printed will be `i + 1`.

### Output Explanation:
The `print` statement will output the following:
- A literal `?`
- The value of `maxi`
- The value of `maxi` again
- The value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1
- The value of `i` again after it has been incremented by 1

Since the exact value of `maxi` and the previous value of `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? maxi maxi i i (where maxi is the value of maxi and i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
