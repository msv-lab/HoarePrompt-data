The code snippet `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The initial state of the variables `maxi`, `arr`, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[0]`; `n` is 2; `res` is an input string.**
