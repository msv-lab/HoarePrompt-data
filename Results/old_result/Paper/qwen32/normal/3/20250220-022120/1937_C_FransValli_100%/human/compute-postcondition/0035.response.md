The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. 

Given the initial state, `arr` could be `[i]`, `[0, i]`, or `[0]` depending on the previous value of `res`. After appending `i`, the new state of `arr` will be `[i, i]`, `[0, i, i]`, or `[0, i]` respectively.

Since `i` is `maxi + 1` and `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`, or `0` if `res` was never `'<'`, the value of `i` is specific but not explicitly given. However, we know that `i` is at least `1` (since `maxi` is at least `0`).

The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i, i]` if `arr` was `[i]`, `[0, i, i]` if `arr` was `[0, i]`, otherwise `arr` is `[0, i]`; `res` is the value of the input string; `i` is `maxi + 1`.**
