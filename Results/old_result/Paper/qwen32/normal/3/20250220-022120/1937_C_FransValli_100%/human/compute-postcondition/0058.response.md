The only object in the loop head is the variable `item`, which iterates over `arr[1:]`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr[1:]`. If there are more elements in `arr[1:]`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `item` is the current element being processed from `arr[1:]`. To execute one more time, `item` needs to be the next element in `arr[1:]`.

Let's break down the state:
- The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0.
- `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.
- If the current value of `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the current `item`.
- `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`.
- `res` is the input string.

Since `item` is the current element being processed, to start the next iteration, `item` should be the next element in the sequence `arr[1:]`.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; if the current value of `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the current `item`; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`; `res` is the input string.** 

However, we need to specify the exact state of `item` for the next iteration. If `item` was the `k`-th element in `arr[1:]`, then for the next iteration, `item` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in `arr[1:]`.

Let's assume `item` was the `k`-th element. Then, for the next iteration, `item` should be `arr[k+1]`.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; if the current value of `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the current `item`; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]` after the current `item`; `res` is the input string.**

Since we don't have the exact index of `item` in `arr[1:]`, we can just say `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains at least two elements where the first element is `mini` and the rest are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; if the current value of `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is updated to the current `item`; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`; `res` is the input string.**
