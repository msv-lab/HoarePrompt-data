To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Number of test cases**: The precondition states that the number of test cases must be at least 1, but this detail is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
2. **`n`**: The precondition states that `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **`maxi`**: This variable is defined as the largest value of `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `res`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `res` was never `'<'`, making `maxi` 0.
4. **`arr`**: The precondition states that `arr` is `[0]`. Therefore, `arr[0]` is `0`.
5. **`i`**: The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can assume that `i` is a variable that is used within the context of the loop or the logic that precedes this print statement. Given that `i` is not initialized or defined before the print statement, we can only describe it as an undefined variable in the context of the given information.

Given these points, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`: A literal string.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi`, which is `0` based on the initial state.
- `arr[0]`: The value of the first element of `arr`, which is `0`.
- `maxi`: Again, the value of `maxi`, which is `0`.
- `i`: The value of `i`, which is undefined in the given context.

Since `i` is undefined, we can only describe it as `i` in the output.

Output: **? 0 0 0 i (where i is an undefined variable in the given context)**
