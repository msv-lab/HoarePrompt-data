Postcondition: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is updated to include `i` at the end if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged; `res` is the value of the new input string; `i` is `maxi + 2`.**
