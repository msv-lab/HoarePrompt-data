To determine the output of the print statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
1. The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1.
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `maxi` is initialized to 0.
4. The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, so we assume it is defined elsewhere in the code and will be provided during execution.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The string `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `maxi` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to consider it as a variable that will be provided during the execution of the program. Since its value is not specified, we will denote it as `i`.

### Output:
Given the above information, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**

This output reflects the literal string `'?'`, the value of `maxi` which is 0, and the value of `i` which is not specified but will be provided during execution.
