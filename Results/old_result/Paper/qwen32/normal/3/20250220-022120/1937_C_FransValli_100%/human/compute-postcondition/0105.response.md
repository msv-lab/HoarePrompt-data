Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise; `n` is `2`; `res` is the user's input string.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated to whatever the user inputs. The other variables (`maxi`, `arr`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
