The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. The values of `n`, `maxi`, `res`, and the condition for `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `i` is now added to the end of the list `arr`.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is updated to include `i` at the end; `res` is the value of the new input string; `i` is `maxi + 2`.**
