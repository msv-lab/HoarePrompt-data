Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `maxi` is 0.
- `arr` is [3, 7, 9].
- `mini` is 9.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes a literal string `'?'`, followed by two occurrences of `maxi`, and two occurrences of `i`.
- `maxi` is explicitly given as 0.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means it is undefined and will raise a `NameError` if the code is executed as is. However, since the task is to determine what would be printed based on the given information, we will assume `i` is intended to be defined in the context not provided here. For the sake of this task, we will assume `i` is a variable that should be part of the initial state but is missing. Since it is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value, but we can represent it symbolically.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- The literal string `'?'`.
- The value of `maxi` which is 0, printed twice.
- The value of `i`, printed twice (where `i` is an undefined variable in the given context, but we will represent it symbolically).

Since `i` is not defined, the actual execution would result in an error. But based on the task requirements, we will represent the output symbolically.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined variable)**

However, to strictly adhere to the format and the given context, we can assume `i` should be part of the initial state but is missing. Since we don't have its value, we can't determine the exact output, but we can represent it as follows:

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
