Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[i, i]` if `res` is `'<'` and the previous `arr` was `[i]`, `[0, i, i]` if `res` is `'<'` and the previous `arr` was `[0, i]`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and unchanged if `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`. `res` is the value of the new input string; `i` is `maxi + 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` has been updated to the new input string, while the values of `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
