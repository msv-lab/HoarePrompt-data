The code snippet assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. Therefore, `mini` no longer holds its previous value (which was either `0` or `n-1` or `item` if `res` equals `'>'`), and instead, it now holds the value of `item`.

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `item`, `n` is the same as the input integer, `arr` has at least two elements, and `res` is the string input by the user.**
