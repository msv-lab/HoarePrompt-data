The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `maxi` (the largest value of `i` for which `res` was `'<'`), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[0]`; `res` is the value of the input string; `i` is `maxi + 1`.**
