The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. However, if `i` is `n-1`, incrementing `i` would make `i` equal to `n`, which would terminate the loop. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time with the current state of `i` and `n`.

Since the task is to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `n-1` so that it can be incremented to `n-1` again. The simplest adjustment would be to set `i` to `n-2`.

State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`**
