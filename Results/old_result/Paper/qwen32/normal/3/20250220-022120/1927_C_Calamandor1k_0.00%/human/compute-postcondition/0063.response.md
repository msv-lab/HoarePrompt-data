Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element or `b` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is 0; `count_a` is incremented by 1 if `len_a` > `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `count_b` is incremented by 1 if `len_b` > `i + 1` and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
