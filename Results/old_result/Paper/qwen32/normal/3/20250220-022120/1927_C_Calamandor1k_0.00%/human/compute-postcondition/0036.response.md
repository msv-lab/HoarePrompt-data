The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This will overwrite the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` with the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `d`, `i`, `count_a`, `count_b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`**.
