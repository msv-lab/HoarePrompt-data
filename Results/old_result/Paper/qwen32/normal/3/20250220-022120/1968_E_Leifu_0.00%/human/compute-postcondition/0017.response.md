The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified directly but we can infer it must have been one less than `t` for the loop to have just ended. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations the loop is supposed to perform.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 3, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 3 and `j` is set to `n` + 1; `i` is incremented by 1**
