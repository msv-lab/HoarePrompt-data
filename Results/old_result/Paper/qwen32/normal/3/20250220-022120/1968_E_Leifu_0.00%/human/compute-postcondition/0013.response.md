The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 4 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing because `j` is no longer within the valid range.

To determine the state for the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the previous valid state of `j` before it reached `n + 1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration (if the loop were to continue) would have `j` set to the next value in the range, which is `4` (the initial value of `j` in the first iteration of the loop).

However, since the loop has already finished, there is no "next iteration" to start. But if we hypothetically consider the start of the loop, the state would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer such that `n` > 3; `j` is 4**
