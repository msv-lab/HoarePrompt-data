### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to solve the problem of finding n points in an n x n grid that maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a different n value.

Let's analyze the program's logic:

- For each test case:
  - The program starts by printing the point (1, 1).
  - It then prints the point (1, 2).
  - If n is 3, it prints the point (2, 3).
  - For n greater than 3, it prints the point (2, 4) and then prints points (j, j) for each j from 4 to n.

Let's consider the output for different values of n:

- For n = 2:
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2)
  - Distances: |1-1|+|1-1| = 0, |1-1|+|2-2| = 0, |1-1|+|1-2| = 1
  - Distinct distances: {0, 1} (Size 2)

- For n = 3:
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)
  - Distances: |1-1|+|1-1| = 0, |1-1|+|2-2| = 0, |2-2|+|3-3| = 0, |1-1|+|1-3| = 2, |1-2|+|1-3| = 1, |2-3|+|1-3| = 3
  - Distinct distances: {0, 1, 2, 3} (Size 4)

- For n = 4:
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 4)
  - Distances: |1-1|+|1-1| = 0, |1-1|+|2-2| = 0, |1-2|+|1-2| = 1, |1-1|+|4-4| = 3, |1-2|+|4-4| = 3, |2-4|+|1-4| = 4, |2-4|+|4-4| = 2, |4-4|+|4-4| = 0
  - Distinct distances: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} (Size 5)

- For n = 5:
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 5)
  - Distances: |1-1|+|1-1| = 0, |1-1|+|2-2| = 0, |1-2|+|1-2| = 1, |1-1|+|4-4| = 3, |1-2|+|4-4| = 3, |2-4|+|1-4| = 4, |2-4|+|4-4| = 2, |4-4|+|4-4| = 0, |1-1|+|5-5| = 4, |1-2|+|5-5| = 4, |2-4|+|5-5| = 5, |4-4|+|5-5| = 1, |5-5|+|5-5| = 0
  - Distinct distances: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (Size 6)

- For n = 6:
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
  - Distances: |1-1|+|1-1| = 0, |1-1|+|2-2| = 0, |1-2|+|1-2| = 1, |1-1|+|4-4| = 3, |1-2|+|4-4| = 3, |2-4|+|1-4| = 4, |2-4|+|4-4| = 2, |4-4|+|4-4| = 0, |1-1|+|5-5| = 4, |1-2|+|5-5| = 4, |2-4|+|5-5| = 5, |4-4|+|5-5| = 1, |5-5|+|5-5| = 0, |1-1|+|6-6| = 5, |1-2|+|6-6| = 5, |2-4|+|6-6| = 6, |4-4|+|6-6| = 2, |5-5|+|6-6| = 1, |6-6|+|6-6| = 0
  - Distinct distances: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (Size 7)

The program seems to be generating a set of points that cover a range of Manhattan distances, but it is not guaranteed to always produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n. For example, for n = 4, the program produces a set of distinct distances {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, but it is possible to achieve a set of distinct distances {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} by selecting different points.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to always produce the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n. Therefore, the program is not always correct.

**Correctness: False**
