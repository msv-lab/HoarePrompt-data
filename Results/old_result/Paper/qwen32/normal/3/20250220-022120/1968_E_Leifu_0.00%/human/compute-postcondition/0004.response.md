The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 2'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is explicitly given as `print('1 2')`.
2. This statement will output the exact string `'1 2'` regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `t` or `n`, the output is simply the string provided within the `print` function.

Output: **1 2**
