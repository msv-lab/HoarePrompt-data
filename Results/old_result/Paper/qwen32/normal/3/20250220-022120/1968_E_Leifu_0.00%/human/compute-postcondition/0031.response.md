The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1 from its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `j` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop head rules.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 3 at the start of the next iteration, provided `t` is greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer; `i` is 3**
