To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it runs. The loop iterates over the range from 4 to `n` inclusive, printing the current value of `j` twice in each iteration.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, `j` was 4.
- After the second iteration, `j` was 5.
- After the third iteration, `j` was 6.

This indicates that the loop has executed for `j` values 4, 5, and 6. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 7 (since the loop runs until `j` reaches `n`).

The loop's body prints `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` for each `j` in the range. Therefore, the output will include lines for each `j` from 4 to `n`, each line containing the value of `j` printed twice.

The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by the loop, so their values remain unchanged. Thus, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and `i` remains 3.

The final output state is that the loop will have printed lines for each integer from 4 to `n`, with each integer printed twice on its respective line. The variables `t` and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 3; the loop prints lines for each integer from 4 to `n`, with each integer printed twice on its respective line.**
