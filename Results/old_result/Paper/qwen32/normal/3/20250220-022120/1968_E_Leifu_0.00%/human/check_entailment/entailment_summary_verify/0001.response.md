Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the given function summary in the context of the problem description. The goal is to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points in an n x n grid.

### Program Analysis

1. **First Two Points**:
   - The program starts by placing the first two points at (1, 1) and (1, 2). This is correct and generates a Manhattan distance of 1 between these two points, along with a distance of 0 from each point to itself.

2. **Third Point for n=3**:
   - For n=3, the program places the third point at (2, 3). 
   - The set of Manhattan distances generated by this configuration is:
     - (1, 1) to (1, 2) -> 1
     - (1, 1) to (2, 3) -> 3
     - (1, 2) to (2, 3) -> 2
     - Distances from each point to itself -> 0
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2, 3}, which is optimal for n=3.

3. **Fourth Point for n=4**:
   - For n=4, the program places the fourth point at (2, 4). 
   - The set of Manhattan distances generated by this configuration is:
     - (1, 1) to (1, 2) -> 1
     - (1, 1) to (2, 3) -> 3
     - (1, 1) to (2, 4) -> 4
     - (1, 2) to (2, 3) -> 2
     - (1, 2) to (2, 4) -> 3
     - (2, 3) to (2, 4) -> 1
     - Distances from each point to itself -> 0
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, which is optimal for n=4.

4. **Subsequent Points for n > 4**:
   - For n > 4, the program places points on the diagonal (j, j) starting from (4, 4). 
   - This placement pattern does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. A better strategy would be to place points in a way that spreads them out more evenly across the grid to cover a wider range of distances.
   - For example, placing points at (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4) for n=4 would generate a more diverse set of distances, ensuring a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion

The program does not always generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n. Specifically, the placement strategy for n > 4 is suboptimal. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
