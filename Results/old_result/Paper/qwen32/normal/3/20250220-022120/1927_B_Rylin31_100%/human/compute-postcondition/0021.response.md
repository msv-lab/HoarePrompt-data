The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over `array`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `array` must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`t`, `l`, `s`, `ans`, and `i`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `array` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`**
