Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is 1 (though `t` is not used in the given code snippet).
2. `l` is an input integer.
3. `s` is a list of `l` integers. Each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in the `array`.
4. `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `s`**:
   - `s` is initialized as a list of `l` integers. Initially, these integers are not specified, but we can assume they are all zeros if not otherwise stated.
   - For each element `j` in `array`, the corresponding element `s[j]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Construction of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is constructed by iterating over each element `j` in `array`.
   - For each `j`, the value of `s[j]` is incremented by 97 to get a character (since 97 corresponds to 'a' in ASCII).
   - This character is then appended to the string `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `l = 5`, so `s` is initially `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Suppose `array = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]`.
  - For `j = 0`, `s[0]` is incremented by 1, so `s = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
  - For `j = 1`, `s[1]` is incremented by 1, so `s = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.
  - For `j = 2`, `s[2]` is incremented by 1, so `s = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.
  - For `j = 1`, `s[1]` is incremented by 1, so `s = [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`.
  - For `j = 3`, `s[3]` is incremented by 1, so `s = [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]`.
- Now, construct `ans`:
  - For `j = 0`, `s[0] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98` which corresponds to 'b'.
  - For `j = 1`, `s[1] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99` which corresponds to 'c'.
  - For `j = 2`, `s[2] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98` which corresponds to 'b'.
  - For `j = 1`, `s[1] + 97 = 2 + 97 = 99` which corresponds to 'c'.
  - For `j = 3`, `s[3] + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98` which corresponds to 'b'.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `'bcccb'`.

### General Description:
The string `ans` is constructed by iterating over each element `j` in `array` and appending the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 97` to `ans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of s[j] incremented by 97 for each j in array)**
