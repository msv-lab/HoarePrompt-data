To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Variable `l`**: It is described as "the new input integer," but its exact value isn't provided in the initial state.
3. **List `s`**: This list is defined such that `s[j]` reflects the number of times the index `j` appeared in `array`. However, the contents of `array` are not provided, so the exact values of `s` are unknown.
4. **List `array`**: It is mentioned that `array` is unchanged, but its contents are not provided. Therefore, we can't determine the exact values of `s` based on the initial state.
5. **String `ans`**: This string is formed by concatenating characters derived from the values in `s`. Specifically, each value `s[j]` corresponds to a character `chr(s[j] + 97)`. Since the values of `s` are not known, the exact string `ans` cannot be determined.
6. **Variable `i`**: It is described as `i + 1`, but its initial value or the context in which it is used are not provided.

Given the lack of specific values for `array`, `s`, and `ans`, we can only describe the output in terms of the relationship between the variables.

The `print(ans)` statement will output the string `ans`, which is constructed from the list `s` where each element `s[j]` is converted to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`. Since the values of `s` depend on the contents of `array`, which are not specified, the exact output cannot be determined.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string formed by concatenating characters derived from the values in the list s, with each value s[j] corresponding to the character chr(s[j] + 97))**
