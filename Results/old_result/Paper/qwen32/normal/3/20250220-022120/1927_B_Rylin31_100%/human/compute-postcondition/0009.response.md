The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans` based on the value of `s[j]`. Given that `s` is a list of `l` zeros with the element at index `j` incremented to 1, `s[j]` will be 1. The ASCII value for 'a' is 97, so `chr(s[j] + 97)` will be `chr(1 + 97)` which is `chr(98)`, and `chr(98)` is 'b'. Therefore, 'b' will be appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros with the element at index `j` incremented to 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a string that has had 'a' and 'b' appended to it, `j` is the next element in `array`.**
