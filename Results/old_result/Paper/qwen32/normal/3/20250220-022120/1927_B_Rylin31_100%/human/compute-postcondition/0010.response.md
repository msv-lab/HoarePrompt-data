The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of `l` zeros with the element at index `j` incremented to 1, which means `s[j]` was initially 1. After the operation, `s[j]` becomes 2.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `array`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros with the element at index `j` incremented to 2, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a string that has had 'a' and 'b' appended to it, `j` is the next element in `array`.**
