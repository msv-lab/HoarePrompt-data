To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given information.

The loop iterates over each element `j` in the `array`. For each `j`, the loop appends a character to `ans` based on the value of `s[j]` and then increments `s[j]` by 1. Specifically, the character appended to `ans` is `chr(s[j] + 97)`, which means `s[j]` determines the position in the alphabet (0 corresponds to 'a', 1 to 'b', and so on).

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `ans` is 'a', meaning `s[j]` was 0 initially.
- After the second iteration, `ans` is 'ab', meaning `s[j]` was 1 after the first iteration.
- After the third iteration, `ans` is 'abc', meaning `s[j]` was 2 after the second iteration.

This pattern suggests that each time the loop runs, it uses the current value of `s[j]` to determine the next character in the alphabet and then increments `s[j]`. The loop will continue to execute for each element in `array`.

After all iterations, `ans` will be a string where each character corresponds to the value of `s[j]` at the time of that iteration, incremented by 97 to get the ASCII value of the corresponding letter.

The final state of `s` will be a list where each element `s[j]` is incremented by 1 for each time `j` appears in `array`.

Since `t` and `l` are not modified within the loop, they remain unchanged. `array` and the initial state of `s` are given as inputs and do not change.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will be a string of characters where each character corresponds to the frequency of the index in `array`, starting from 'a'. `s` will reflect how many times each index in `array` was encountered.
