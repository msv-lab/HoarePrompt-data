The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. Given that `s[j]` is initially 2, after the operation, `s[j]` will be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 3, `array` must have more than one element, `ans` is either `'aac'` or `'abc'`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the next element in `array`**.
