The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the variable `ans` by appending a character to it. The character is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`. Given that `s[j]` is either 0 or 1, the ASCII values will be 97 or 98, which correspond to the characters 'a' and 'b', respectively.

Given this, if `s[j]` is 0, `chr(s[j] + 97)` will be 'a'. If `s[j]` is 1, `chr(s[j] + 97)` will be 'b'. Since the initial value of `ans` is 'a', the new value of `ans` will be 'aa' if `s[j]` is 0, and 'ab' if `s[j]` is 1.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` is 1, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `j` is the next element in `array`, `ans` is 'aa' if `s[j]` is 0, 'ab' if `s[j]` is 1**.
