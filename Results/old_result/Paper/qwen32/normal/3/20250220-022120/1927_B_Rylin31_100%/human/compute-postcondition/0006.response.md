The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the variable `ans` by appending a character to it. The character is determined by converting the ASCII value `s[j] + 97` to a character using the `chr` function. Given that `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `s[j]` will be 0 for any valid index `j`. Thus, `s[j] + 97` will be 97, and `chr(97)` is `'a'`. Therefore, `ans` will have `'a'` appended to it.

The values of `t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `j` are not changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a string that has had 'a' appended to it**.
