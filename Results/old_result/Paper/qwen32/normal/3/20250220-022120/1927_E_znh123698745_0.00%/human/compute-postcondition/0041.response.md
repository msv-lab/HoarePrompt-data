The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` attempts to append an element from `array` to `answer` using the last element of another list `a` as the index. However, there is a mistake in the code because `a` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `a` is a typo and should be `array`, the code would append the last element of `array` to `answer`.

Given:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`.
- `i` is 3.

If we correct the typo and assume the code should be `answer.append(array[array[-1]])`, then:
- `array[-1]` is the last element of `array`, which is `n`.
- `array[n]` would be out of bounds because list indices in Python are 0-based, and `array` has indices from 0 to `n-1`.

However, if we interpret `array[array[-1]]` as `array[n-1]` (which is the last element of `array`), then:
- `array[n-1]` is `n`.

Thus, `answer` will have `n` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`; `i` is 3; `answer` is a list containing `n`.**
