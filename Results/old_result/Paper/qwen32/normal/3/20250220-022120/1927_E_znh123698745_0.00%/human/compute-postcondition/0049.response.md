To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state. The code snippet is:

```python
answer.append(array[a[0]])
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `k` is an input integer
- `i` is 4

The code snippet appends an element from `array` to `answer`. The element is specified by `a[0]`, which means the first element of the list `a`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `array` or `a`, we can only infer that the `answer` list will have an additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`.

Thus, the output state will be:
- `n` must still be greater than 4 (unchanged)
- `k` is still an input integer (unchanged)
- `i` is still 4 (unchanged)
- `answer` will have an additional element `array[a[0]]` appended to it

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 4, `answer` has an additional element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.**
