The code creates a list named `array` that contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even still holds.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is even, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n inclusive.**
