The code snippet initializes a list named `answer` with a single element, which is the integer `1`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `array`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `answer` list with the specified initial value.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is even, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n inclusive; `answer` is a list containing the integer 1.**
