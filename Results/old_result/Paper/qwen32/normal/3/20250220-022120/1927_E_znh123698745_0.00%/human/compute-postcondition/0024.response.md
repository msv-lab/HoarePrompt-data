Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even. `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, with its last element set to `n - 1` if `i` is even, or `n - 2` if `i` is odd. `i` is 1. `answer` is a list containing the integer `n` and `1` if `i` is odd, or `n` and `array[1]` if `i` is even. If `i` is odd, `a[0]` is not modified. If `i` is even, `a[0]` is set to 2.**
