In the given task, the loop is controlled by the expression `int(input())`. This means that the number of iterations is determined by the integer value provided by the input. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the state before the loop, but they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust the state related to the input that controls the loop.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The variables `n` and `k` are given constraints but are not directly related to the loop's execution count. They are part of the overall problem context but do not affect whether the loop runs or not based on the loop head.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that controls the loop execution. We need to ensure that the input value is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is even, and the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the input value for the loop must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**.
