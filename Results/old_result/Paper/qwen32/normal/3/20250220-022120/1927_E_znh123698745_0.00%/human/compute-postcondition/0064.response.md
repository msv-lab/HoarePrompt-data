The code appends the element at index `a[0]` of `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `a[0]` is `1` and `array` is a list containing integers from `1` to `n` with an additional `(-1)` at the end, the element at index `1` of `array` is `2` (since list indexing starts at `0`).

Therefore, `answer` which was initially `[1]` will now be `[1, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, 2]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, and `(-1)`**.
