The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` in a specific order: starting with 1, then `n`, then 2, then `n-1`, and so on, alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers until all numbers are included in the sequence.
