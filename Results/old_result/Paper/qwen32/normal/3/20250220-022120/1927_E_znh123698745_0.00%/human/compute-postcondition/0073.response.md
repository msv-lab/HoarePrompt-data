The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `answer` contains the integer 3**
