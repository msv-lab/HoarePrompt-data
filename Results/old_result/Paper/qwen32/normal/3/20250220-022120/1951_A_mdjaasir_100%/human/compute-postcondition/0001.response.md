In the given task, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in the control of the loop's execution. According to the loop statement:

```
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute `t` times, where `i` will take values from `0` to `t-1`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variables `start` and `end` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as they are not part of the loop's control logic.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0. The values of `start` and `end` can remain as they are, given that `start` <= `end`.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
