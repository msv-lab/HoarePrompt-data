Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Regardless of whether `count` is 2 or not, the postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts.**
