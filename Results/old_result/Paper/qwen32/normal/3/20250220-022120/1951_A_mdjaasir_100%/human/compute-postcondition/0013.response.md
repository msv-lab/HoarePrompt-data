The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various conditions and values for different variables, but these conditions and values do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The print statement is simply printing the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
