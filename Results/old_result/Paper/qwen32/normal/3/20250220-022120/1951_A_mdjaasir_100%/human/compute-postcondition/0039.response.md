Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

Here's a breakdown of the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is the user input.
- `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

However, none of these variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`, `i`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This means that regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state, the `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **YES**
