To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the code and the provided initial state:

- `sum` is 90
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 2
- `j` is greater than 5

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's analyze each part of the `print` statement:
- The first argument is the integer `2`.
- The second argument is `j % n`. Here, `j` is greater than 5, and `n` is 5. The modulus operation (`%`) gives the remainder of the division of `j` by `n`. Since `j` is greater than 5, the remainder when `j` is divided by 5 can be any value from 0 to 4. However, without the exact value of `j`, we can't determine the exact remainder, but we know it will be one of these values.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` (a number greater than 5) is divided by 5. The exact value depends on `j`, but it will be one of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- The output ends with a space.

Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `j % n`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the possible values.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder when j is divided by 5, and j is greater than 5) end with a space**
