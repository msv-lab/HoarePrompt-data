To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the conditions inside the loop.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is 0
- `r` is 0
- `n` is an input integer (let's assume a specific value for `n` to illustrate the process; let's use `n = 5` for this example)
- `t` is 2
- `j` is 8

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
        r = i
        sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
    else:
        sum += i * n
```

### Iterations Analysis:

1. **Iteration 1 (i = 1)**:
    - `n * (n + 1) // 2 = 5 * 6 // 2 = 15`
    - `i * n = 1 * 5 = 5`
    - Since `15 > 5`, `r` is set to `1` and `sum` is updated to `0 + 15 = 15`.

2. **Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:
    - `n * (n + 1) // 2 = 15`
    - `i * n = 2 * 5 = 10`
    - Since `15 > 10`, `r` is set to `2` and `sum` is updated to `15 + 15 = 30`.

3. **Iteration 3 (i = 3)**:
    - `n * (n + 1) // 2 = 15`
    - `i * n = 3 * 5 = 15`
    - Since `15 <= 15`, `r` remains `2` and `sum` is updated to `30 + 15 = 45`.

4. **Iteration 4 (i = 4)**:
    - `n * (n + 1) // 2 = 15`
    - `i * n = 4 * 5 = 20`
    - Since `15 <= 20`, `r` remains `2` and `sum` is updated to `45 + 20 = 65`.

5. **Iteration 5 (i = 5)**:
    - `n * (n + 1) // 2 = 15`
    - `i * n = 5 * 5 = 25`
    - Since `15 <= 25`, `r` remains `2` and `sum` is updated to `65 + 25 = 90`.

### Final Output State:
- `sum` is `90`
- `r` is `2`
- `n` remains `5`
- `t` remains `2`
- `j` remains `8`

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **sum is 90, r is 2, n is 5, t is 2, j is 8.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the sum is 90, the value of `r` is 2, the input integer `n` remains 5, and the variables `t` and `j` remain unchanged at 2 and 8, respectively.
