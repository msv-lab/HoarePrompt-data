The code snippet provided is `r = i`. This line of code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `r`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only state that `r` is now equal to whatever value `i` holds.

The other variables (`sum`, `n`, `t`, `j`, and the condition involving `n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is 0, `r` is `i`, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `j` is 8, and the current value of `n` satisfies the condition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
