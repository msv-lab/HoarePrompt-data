The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n + 1` (excluding `n + 1`). Given the initial state, `n` is 5. Therefore, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to 5.

The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the range object, so the numbers are printed as separate arguments to the `print` function, which results in them being printed on the same line separated by spaces.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. `n` is 5.
2. `range(1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, 6)`, which generates the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
3. `*range(1, 6)` unpacks the sequence into individual numbers.
4. `print(*range(1, 6))` prints the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on the same line separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
