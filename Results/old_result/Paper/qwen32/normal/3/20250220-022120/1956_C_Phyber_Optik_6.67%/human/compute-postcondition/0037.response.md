The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1, n + r + 1`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 0 and `r` is 2, the range of the loop is from 1 to 3 (since `n + r + 1` equals 3).

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`sum` is 75, `r` is 2, `n` is 0, `j` is 2**
