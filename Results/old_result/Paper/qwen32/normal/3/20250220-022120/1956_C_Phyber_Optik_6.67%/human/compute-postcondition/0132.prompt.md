You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix for that test case. It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum, r = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        
        print(sum, n + r)
        
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: - Since `t = 2`, there are two test cases.
    #   - We already have the states for both test cases.
    #   - The final output state will be the state after the second test case.
    #
    #Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, the function returns the size of the matrix `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
