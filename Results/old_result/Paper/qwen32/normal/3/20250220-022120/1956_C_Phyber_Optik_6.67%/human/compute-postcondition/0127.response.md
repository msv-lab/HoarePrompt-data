Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is 90
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 2
- `j` is 4

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n + 1` (not inclusive).
- Given that `n` is 5, `n + 1` is 6.
- Therefore, `range(1, 6)` generates the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence and prints each number separated by a space.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the numbers 1 through 5, each separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
