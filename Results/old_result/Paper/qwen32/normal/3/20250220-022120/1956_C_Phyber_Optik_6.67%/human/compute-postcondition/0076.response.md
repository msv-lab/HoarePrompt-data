The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will generate a sequence of numbers using the `range` function and print them. The `range` function generates numbers starting from the first argument (inclusive) to the second argument (exclusive). Here, `n` is given as 5, so `n + 1` is 6. Therefore, `range(1, 6)` will generate the numbers 1 through 5.

The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the range object, so each number in the range is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function, resulting in them being printed on the same line separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
