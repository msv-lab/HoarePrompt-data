Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State
- `sum` is 75. (Note: This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant to the output.)
- `r` is 2. (Note: This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant to the output.)
- `n` is 0. (Note: This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant to the output.)
- `j` is less than or equal to 0.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis
- The print function is called with three arguments: `1`, `j`, and the keyword argument `end=' '`.
- The first argument is the integer `1`, which will be printed as is.
- The second argument is the variable `j`. According to the initial state, `j` is less than or equal to 0. However, the exact value of `j` is not specified, so we can only say that it will be an integer that satisfies the condition `j <= 0`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that after printing the arguments, a space character should be printed instead of the default newline character.

### Output
The output will be the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j` (which is an integer less than or equal to 0), and then a space character.

Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, the most precise description we can give is:
Output: **1 [j]  (where j is an integer less than or equal to 0)**
