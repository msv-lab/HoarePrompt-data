Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `sum` is 75.
- `r` is 2.
- `n` is 0.
- `j` is greater than `n`, meaning `j` is any positive integer.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the print statement:
- The first value to be printed is `2`, which is a constant integer.
- The second value to be printed is `j % n`. Given that `n` is 0, attempting to compute `j % n` will result in a division by zero error in Python. However, since the task is to determine what would be printed and assuming we are to consider the logical implications without actually executing the code, we can infer that this operation is undefined due to the division by zero.

Given the precondition and the print statement, the precise output cannot be determined due to the undefined behavior of `j % n` when `n` is 0. However, if we strictly adhere to the task of describing the output based on the given information, we can state that the second part of the print statement will raise an error.

For the sake of adhering to the format and providing the most precise description possible based on the given information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **2, (an error due to division by zero)**
