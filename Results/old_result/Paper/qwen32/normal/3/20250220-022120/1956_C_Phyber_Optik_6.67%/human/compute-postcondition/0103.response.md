The value of `r` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 5. The values of `sum`, `n`, `t`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition that determines the initial values of `sum` and `r` is not affected by the assignment `r = i`.

Output State: **`sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `2 * i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`; `r` is 5; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `t` is 2; `j` is 8; `i` is 5**.
