The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The value of `n` is given to be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` and `r` are expressed in terms of each other but not directly affected by the calculation.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i + 1`, `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its previous value.**
