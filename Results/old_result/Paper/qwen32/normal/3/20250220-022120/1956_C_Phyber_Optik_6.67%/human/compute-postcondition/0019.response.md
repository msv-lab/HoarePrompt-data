The code snippet `sum += i * n` modifies the value of `sum` by adding the product of `i` and `n` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, and the increment operation `i = i + 1` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `sum` is increased by `i * n`.**
