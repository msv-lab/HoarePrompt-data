The code assigns the value of `i` to `r`. The value of `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, so `r` will take that value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `i + 1`**.
