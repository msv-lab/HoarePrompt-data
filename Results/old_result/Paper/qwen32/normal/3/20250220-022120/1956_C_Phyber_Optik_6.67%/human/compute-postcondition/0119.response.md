To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the `print` statement and the variables involved. The `print` statement is:

```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Given the initial state, the variable `n` is 5. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). Since `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks this sequence so that each number is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function, resulting in a space-separated list of numbers.

Therefore, the output will be the numbers 1 through 5, each separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
