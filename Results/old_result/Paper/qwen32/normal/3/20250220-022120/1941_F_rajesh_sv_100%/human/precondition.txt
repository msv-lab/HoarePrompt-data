The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, and k, representing the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the complexities of the prepared problems in strictly increasing order. Then, there are two lists: the first list contains m integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_m, representing the complexities of the models, and the second list contains k integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_k, representing the complexities of the functions. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. All complexities are positive integers not exceeding 2 * 10^9.
