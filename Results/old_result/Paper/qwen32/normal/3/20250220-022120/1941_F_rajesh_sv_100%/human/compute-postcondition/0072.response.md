Postcondition: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the second element of `F`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `ans` is the minimum of `max_diff`, `D[l] + f - left`, and `right - D[l] - f`, and `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`, `ans` is the minimum of `max_diff`, `D[l] + f - left`, and `right - D[l] - f`, and `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. In both cases, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
