Output State: **`testcases` is 0 and `func_6()` has been executed `testcases` times initially returned by `func_3()`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `testcases` will be 0 because the loop runs for the number of times equal to the initial value returned by `func_3()`, decrementing `testcases` by 1 in each iteration. Additionally, `func_6()` will have been executed exactly as many times as the initial value of `testcases`.
