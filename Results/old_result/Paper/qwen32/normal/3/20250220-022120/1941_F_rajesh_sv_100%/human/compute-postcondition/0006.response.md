Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, and `func_6()` has been executed.**

Natural language: The value of `testcases` remains the same as it was initially, which is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 2, and it is still greater than 0. The function `func_6()` has been executed, but it does not affect the value of `testcases`.
