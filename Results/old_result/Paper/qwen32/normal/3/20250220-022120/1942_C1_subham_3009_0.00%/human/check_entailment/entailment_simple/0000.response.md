### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices of a regular polygon. The key points to consider are:
1. The number of vertices `n` in the polygon.
2. The number of vertices `x` already chosen by Bessie.
3. The number of additional vertices `y` that can be chosen by us (which is `0` in this version of the problem).

The output for each test case should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using the `x` vertices Bessie has already chosen.

The provided program reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs `x - 2` for each test case. This is based on the combinatorial fact that for `x` vertices on a polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices: `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
   - Output: `x - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices: `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
   - Output: `x - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6`
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices: `[1, 3]`
   - Output: `x - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
   - However, this does not match the expected output (which is `2`). This is because when `x = 2`, it is impossible to form any triangles. The correct logic should handle this edge case, but the provided program does not.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles for `x >= 3`. However, it fails to handle the edge case where `x = 2`, which should result in `0` triangles instead of `-1` (which is what `x - 2` would result in for `x = 2`).

Therefore, the program is **not** entirely correct.

### Correctness: **False**
