Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. Additionally, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If the program is executed as the main module, `t` is set to 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the last set of integers from the input, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen in the last iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
