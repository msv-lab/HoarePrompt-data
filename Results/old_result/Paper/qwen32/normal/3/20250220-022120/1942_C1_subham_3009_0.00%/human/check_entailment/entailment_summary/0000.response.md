### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

**Problem Analysis:**

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be created by drawing diagonals between a given set of vertices in a regular polygon.

- **Constraints:**
  - The number of sides of the polygon, `n`, can be as large as \(10^9\).
  - The number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `x`, is between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\).
  - The number of additional vertices you can choose, `y`, is always 0 in this version of the problem.

- **Key Insight:**
  - Since `y = 0`, no additional vertices can be chosen. Therefore, the solution must be based solely on the `x` vertices provided.
  - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon is `x - 2`. This can be understood by considering that a convex polygon with `x` vertices can be triangulated into `x - 2` triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

**Program Analysis:**

The provided program reads the input as described in the problem statement and outputs `x - 2` for each test case. This output is consistent with the insight derived from the problem analysis.

- **Execution Summary:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
  - It then reads the list of `x` vertices.
  - Finally, it prints `x - 2` as the result for each test case.

Given that the program consistently outputs `x - 2` for each test case, which aligns with the expected maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using the given vertices, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
