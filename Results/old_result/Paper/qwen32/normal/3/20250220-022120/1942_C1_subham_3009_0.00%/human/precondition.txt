t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
