To determine what will be printed by the `print(x - 2)` statement, we need to understand the value of `x` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is `t - 1`, but this does not affect the value of `x` directly.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from the new input, respectively.
- `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the remaining elements are strings.

### Analysis:
- The variable `x` is explicitly mentioned as the second integer from the new input.
- The expression `x - 2` will be evaluated based on the value of `x`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(x - 2)` statement will be the result of subtracting 2 from the value of `x`. Since `x` is the second integer from the new input, the exact numerical value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. However, we can describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the new input)**
