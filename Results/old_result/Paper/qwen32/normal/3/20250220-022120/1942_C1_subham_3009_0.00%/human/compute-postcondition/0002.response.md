In the given program state and the `while` loop condition, the only variable in the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, it is already ensured that `t` is greater than 0, meaning the loop can certainly execute at least once.

Since no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5); `y` is 0; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the program is executing within the main module, indicated by the condition `__name__ == '__main__'`**
