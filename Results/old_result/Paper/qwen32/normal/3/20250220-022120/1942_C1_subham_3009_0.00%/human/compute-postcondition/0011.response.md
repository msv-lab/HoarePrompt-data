The code snippet `arr = input().split()` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `t` is `t - 1`, and `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from a new input, respectively. However, since the input for `n`, `x`, and `y` is not explicitly provided in the code snippet, we will only update `arr` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from the new input, respectively, `arr` is a list of strings from the new input split by whitespace.**
