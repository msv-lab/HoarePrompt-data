The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then mapped to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. This means the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the program is executing within the main module, indicated by the condition `__name__ == '__main__'.**
