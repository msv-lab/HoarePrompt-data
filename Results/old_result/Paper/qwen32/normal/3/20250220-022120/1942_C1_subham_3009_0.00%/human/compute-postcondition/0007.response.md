To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the variable `x` as it is the only variable used in the `print` statement. According to the initial state, `x` is the second integer from the input.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `x`. The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `x - 2`.

Thus, the output will be the value of `x` minus 2.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the input)**
