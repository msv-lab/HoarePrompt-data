The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the expression `x + 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `x` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables, with `x` being at least 0; `z` is 2 + 1 // (k - 1); `i` is 1**
