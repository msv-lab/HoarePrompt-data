Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables, with `x` being at least 0; `z` is the value calculated after `x + 1` iterations using the formula `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1`; `i` is `x`. Additionally, `a` is less than `z`.**
