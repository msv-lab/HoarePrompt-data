To determine the correctness of the program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and conditions provided within the code and compare them with the problem description and the example cases.

### Analysis of Given Program

The program reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`. The logic of the program is based on the following conditions:

1. **Condition 1: `x < k - 1`**
   - If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".
   
2. **Condition 2: `x == k - 1`**
   - If `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".
   
3. **Condition 3: `x > k - 1`**
   - If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates a variable `z` which is the sum of a series of values derived from the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations. It then checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Verification Against Problem Description

Let's verify the logic of the program against the provided examples and the problem description:

1. **First Test Case: `k=2, x=1, a=7`**
   - `x < k - 1` is false (`1 < 2 - 1` is false).
   - `x == k - 1` is true (`1 == 2 - 1` is true).
   - Since `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 3` which is `7 >= 1 + 3` and it is true.
   - **Expected Output: "YES"** (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case: `k=2, x=1, a=1`**
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is true.
   - Since `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 3` which is `1 >= 1 + 3` and it is false.
   - **Expected Output: "NO"** (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case: `k=2, x=3, a=15`**
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - The program calculates `z` as follows:
     - Iteration 1: `z = 0 + 0 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1`
     - Iteration 2: `z = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - Iteration 3: `z = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7`
     - Iteration 4: `z = 7 + 7 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 15`
   - The program checks if `a >= z` which is `15 >= 15` and it is true.
   - **Expected Output: "YES"** (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case: `k=3, x=3, a=6`**
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - The program calculates `z` as follows:
     - Iteration 1: `z = 0 + 0 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 1`
     - Iteration 2: `z = 1 + 1 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2`
     - Iteration 3: `z = 2 + 2 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - Iteration 4: `z = 3 + 3 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 4`
   - The program checks if `a >= z` which is `6 >= 4` and it is true.
   - **Expected Output: "YES"** (Incorrect, as the output is "NO")

5. **Fifth Test Case: `k=4, x=4, a=5`**
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - The program calculates `z` as follows:
     - Iteration 1: `z = 0 + 0 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 1`
     - Iteration 2: `z = 1 + 1 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 2`
     - Iteration 3: `z = 2 + 2 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - Iteration 4: `z = 3 + 3 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 4`
     - Iteration 5: `z = 4 + 4 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 5`
   - The program checks if `a >= z` which is `5 >= 5` and it is true.
   - **Expected Output: "YES"** (Incorrect, as the output is "NO")

6. **Sixth Test Case: `k=5, x=4, a=7`**
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.

     - Iteration 2: `z = 1 + 1 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 2`
     - Iteration 3: `z = 2 + 2 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - Iteration 4: `z = 3 + 3 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 4`
     - Iteration 5: `z = 4 + 4 // (5 - 1) + 1 = 5`
   - The program checks if `a >= z` which is `7 >= 5` and it is true.
   - **Expected Output: "YES"** (Correct)

7. **Seventh Test Case: `k=4, x=88, a=1000000000`**

   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - The program calculates `z` as follows:
     - Iteration 1: `z = 0 + 0 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 1`
     - Iteration 2: `z = 1 + 1 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 2`
     - Iteration 3: `z = 2 + 2 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - Iteration 4: `z = 3 + 3 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 4`
     - Iteration 5: `z = 4 + 4 // (4 - 1) + 1 = 5`
     - ... (this continues up to 89 iterations)
   - The value of `z` after 89 iterations will be significantly larger than `1000000000`.
   - The program checks if `a >= z` which is `1000000000 >= z` and it is false.
