Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, k, x, and a are integers such that 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an input integer within the range 1 to 1000. The constraints for `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
