Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables.
- The conditions for `a` are based on the value of `x` relative to `k - 1`:
  - If `x < k - 1`, then `a` can be either \(\geq x + 1\) or \(< x + 1\).
  - If `x = k - 1`, then `a` can be either \(\geq x + 3\) or \(< x + 3\).
  - If `x > k - 1`, `z` is calculated by iterating the formula:
    \[
    z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1
    \]
    for `x + 1` times, and `a` can be either \(\geq z\) or \(< z\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z` (if calculated) do not affect the output of this `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the conditions and calculations described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
