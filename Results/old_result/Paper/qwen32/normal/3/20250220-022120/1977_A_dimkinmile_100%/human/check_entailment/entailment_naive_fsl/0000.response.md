Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine whether it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is even. This condition is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between `n` and `m` must match.
- `n - m >= 0` checks if the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the number of cubes `m`. This is necessary because you cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

However, the condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient on its own. It does not account for the possibility that `m` could be greater than `n` if `n` is odd. For example, if `n` is 1 and `m` is 0, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` would evaluate to `True` because `(1 - 0) % 2 == 0` and `1 - 0 >= 0`, but it is impossible to end up with 0 cubes after 1 move.

A correct condition should be `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0` to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, regardless of whether `n` is greater than or less than `m`.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `1 0`
- Expected Output: `No`
- Actual Output: `Yes` (incorrect)

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
