The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `m`, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively. It also specifies that the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative, meaning `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and their difference is an even number. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'` without referencing any of these variables.

Given this, the value to be printed is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of `n` or `m`.

Output: **Yes**
