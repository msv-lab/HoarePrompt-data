Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the key observations and logic necessary to solve the problem. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`. It then checks if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative, which are the correct conditions for determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The annotations provided in the annotated code align with the reasoning and logic described in the original assessment, and the examples given in the assessment match the expected outcomes based on the program's logic.

The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly determines if the conditions `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` are met and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
