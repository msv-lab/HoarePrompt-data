Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to ensure the program's correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective:** Determine if Nikita can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Constraints:**
  - Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
  - The initial number of cubes is 0.
  - The difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative (`n - m >= 0`).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and checks whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the condition that `n - m` is even and non-negative.

Here's the code for reference:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Verification:
1. **Parity Condition:**
   - The difference `n - m` must be even. This ensures that the total number of moves (either adding or removing cubes) results in the exact number `m`.
   
2. **Non-Negative Condition:**
   - The difference `n - m` must be non-negative, meaning `n >= m`. This ensures that Nikita doesn't end up with a negative number of cubes.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n - m = -2` (negative), so the output is "No".
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given constraints. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the example walkthrough confirms that the program produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks the necessary conditions for the problem and outputs the correct result for each test case.
Final: **True**
