The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`. The initial state provided does not influence the content of the string being printed. The variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, and `rank` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
