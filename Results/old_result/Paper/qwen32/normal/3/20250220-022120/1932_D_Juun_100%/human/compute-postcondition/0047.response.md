The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`. The initial state description does not mention any conditions or variables that would alter the execution of this print statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('IMPOSSIBLE')`.
2. The string `'IMPOSSIBLE'` is a literal and does not depend on any variables or conditions.
3. The initial state describes various variables and objects (`trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `next_suit`, `next_rank`, `popped_trump`, `trump`), but none of these affect the execution or output of the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
