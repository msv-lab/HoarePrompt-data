Postcondition: **`trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was just popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank, `suit` is `next_suit`, `rank` is `next_rank`. If `rank` is `None`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `trumps` is not empty, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.**
