Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` contains all trump card ranks, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs, and `suits` contains `None` for all suits unless there was an odd number of non-trump cards for a particular suit, in which case it will have the last unpaired card's rank for that suit.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank. If the current value of `rank` is None, it remains None.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was just popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank, `suit` is `next_suit`, `rank` is `next_rank`. If `rank` is `None`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `trumps` is not empty, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was just popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, and if `trumps` is not empty, it also contains the newly appended string `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank, `suit` is the next suit in the dictionary, and `rank` is the rank corresponding to the next suit in the dictionary. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
