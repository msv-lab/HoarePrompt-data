The code snippet `trumps.append(rank)` appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. Given that `rank` is 'A', the list `trumps` will now contain ['A']. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `trumps` is ['A'], `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values `None`, `rank` is 'A', `suit` is 'C', and `suit` equals `trump`**.
