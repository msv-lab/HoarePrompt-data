The code snippet assigns the first element of the tuple `card` to the variable `rank` and the second element to the variable `suit`. Given that `card` is `next_card_next`, we can infer that `rank` and `suit` will be the first and second elements of `next_card_next`, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is `next_card_next`, `rank` is the first element of `next_card_next`, `suit` is the second element of `next_card_next`.**
