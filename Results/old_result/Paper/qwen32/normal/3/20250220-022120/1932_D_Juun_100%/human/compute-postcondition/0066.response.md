The only variable in the loop head is `answer`, and it iterates over the `answers` list. For the loop to execute, `answers` must contain at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts, `answers` contains all formed pairs. To ensure the loop executes, `answers` must have at least one pair.

No adjustments are needed for `trumps` and `suits` as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` must contain at least one pair, `suits` contains `None` for all suits that had non-None ranks**
