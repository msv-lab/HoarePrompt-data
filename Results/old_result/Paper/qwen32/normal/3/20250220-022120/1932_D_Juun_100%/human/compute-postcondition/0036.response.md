The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement, it does not change any of the variables or their values directly. The variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, and `rank` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` contains all trump card ranks, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs, `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank, and the current value of `rank` is None.**
