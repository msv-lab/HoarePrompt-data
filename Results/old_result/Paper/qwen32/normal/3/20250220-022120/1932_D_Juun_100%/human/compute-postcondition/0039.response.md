The code snippet appends a formatted string to the `answers` list and removes an element from the `trumps` list. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `answers` gains a new string element formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.
- `trumps` loses its last element, which is the one that was popped and used in the formatted string.

Given the initial state, `trumps` is not empty, so `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the last element of `trumps`. The `rank` and `suit` variables are used in the string formatting but their values remain unchanged unless they were `None`, in which case they remain `None`.

Output State: **`trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank. If the current value of `rank` is None, it remains None.**
