Output State: **`trumps` contains all trump card ranks except the last one that was popped, `answers` contains all sorted non-trump card pairs plus the new string `'{rank}{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`, `suits` contains at least one suit with a non-None rank, `suit` is `next_suit`, `rank` is `next_rank`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves the loop to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `suit`, and `rank` remain unchanged. The loop continues as per its original logic.
