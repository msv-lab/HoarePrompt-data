Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a string of 2n two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile. `trump` is now assigned the value of the input character representing the trump suit. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `rank` is 'A', `suit` is 'C'. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` is ['A'] and `answers` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `suits['C']` is not `None`, `answers` contains `'A' + 'C' + value_C + 'C'` if `value_C` is greater than 'A', or `value_C + 'C' + 'A' + 'C'` if `value_C` is less than 'A'. If `suits['C']` is `None`, `suits['C']` is 'A' and `answers` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `rank` is the first character of `next_card`, `suit` is the second character of `next_card`, `card` is `next_card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` includes `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` is a list with a new string appended in the format of the sorted concatenation of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is `next_card_next`, `rank` is the first element of `next_card_next`, `suit` is the second element of `next_card_next`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` includes `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains a new string which is the space-separated concatenation of the sorted `rank` and `suits[suit]` with `suit` appended to each, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
