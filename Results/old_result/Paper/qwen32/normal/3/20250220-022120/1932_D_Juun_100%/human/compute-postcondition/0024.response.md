Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `rank` is the first character of `next_card`, `suit` is the second character of `next_card`, `card` is `next_card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` includes `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` is a list with a new string appended in the format of the sorted concatenation of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`.**
