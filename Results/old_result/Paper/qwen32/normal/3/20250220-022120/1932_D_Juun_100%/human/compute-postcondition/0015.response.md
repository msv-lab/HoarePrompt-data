Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `trumps` is an empty list, `rank` is 'A', `suit` is 'C', and `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits['C']` is not `None`, then `answers` is a list containing the string `'A' + 'C' + value_C + 'C'` if `value_C` is greater than 'A', or `value_C + 'C' + 'A' + 'C'` if `value_C` is less than 'A'. Otherwise, `suits['C']` is 'A' and `answers` is an empty list.**
