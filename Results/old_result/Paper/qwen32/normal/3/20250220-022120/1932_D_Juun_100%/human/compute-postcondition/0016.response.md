Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `rank` is 'A', `suit` is 'C'. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` is ['A'] and `answers` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `suits['C']` is not `None`, `answers` contains `'A' + 'C' + value_C + 'C'` if `value_C` is greater than 'A', or `value_C + 'C' + 'A' + 'C'` if `value_C` is less than 'A'. If `suits['C']` is `None`, `suits['C']` is 'A' and `answers` is an empty list.**
