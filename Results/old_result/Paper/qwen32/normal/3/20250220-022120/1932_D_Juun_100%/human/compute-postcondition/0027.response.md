The code snippet `trumps.append(rank)` adds the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. The values of `t`, `n`, `trump`, `card`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged except for `trumps`, which now includes the new element `rank`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is `next_card_next`, `rank` is the first element of `next_card_next`, `suit` is the second element of `next_card_next`, `trumps` includes `rank`.**
