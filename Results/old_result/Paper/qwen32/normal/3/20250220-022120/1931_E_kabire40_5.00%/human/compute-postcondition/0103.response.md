The code snippet reads two values from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `list_len` and `max_power` respectively. The values of `rev_res`, `y`, and `rev_val` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`rev_res` is an empty string; `y` is [previous value of y] + 1; `rev_val` is an empty list; `list_len` is the first value from the input; `max_power` is the second value from the input.**
