The code snippet takes the first element of `operational_list`, reverses it, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `x_rev`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is [previous value of y] + 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`.**
