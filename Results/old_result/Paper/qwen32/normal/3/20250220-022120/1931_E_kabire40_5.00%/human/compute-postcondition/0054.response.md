The code snippet `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input string, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list to `operational_list`. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces.**
