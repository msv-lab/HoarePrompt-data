The code snippet `val_in = int(rev_val[x])` converts the `x`-th element of the `rev_val` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `val_in`. 

Since `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, and `x` is the current string from `operational_list` with an even length, `rev_val[x]` refers to the `x`-th element of this list.

The values of `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `rev_res`, and `rev_val` remain unchanged, except for the introduction of the new variable `val_in`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, sorted in ascending order with at least one element, and `val_in` is the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val`.**
