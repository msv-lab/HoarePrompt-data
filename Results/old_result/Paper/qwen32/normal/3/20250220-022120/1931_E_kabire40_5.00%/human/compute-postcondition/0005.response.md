To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `operational_list`, so we need to ensure that `operational_list` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `operational_list`, so `operational_list` is the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `operational_list` has at least one element.

Given this, we need to ensure that `operational_list` is not empty. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `operational_list` contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input by spaces and must contain at least one element**.
