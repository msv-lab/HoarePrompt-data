The code snippet `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Given that `x` is the second string in `operational_list` and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, the reversed string `x[::-1]` is added to `rev_val`. 

Since `rev_val` was initially either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string `x_next` based on the length condition, after appending `x[::-1]`, `rev_val` will definitely contain the reversed string `x` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces and must have at least two strings, `x` is the second string in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_res` is the second string in `operational_list` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, otherwise `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string `x` appended to it.**
