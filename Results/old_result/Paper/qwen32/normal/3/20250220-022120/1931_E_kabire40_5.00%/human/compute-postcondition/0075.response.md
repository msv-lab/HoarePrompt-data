Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, and `rev_val` is sorted in ascending order with at least one element. The current string `x` from `operational_list` is such that its length modulo 2 equals 0.**
