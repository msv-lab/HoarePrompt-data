You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then performs operations on the list, involving reversing some of the integers and sorting them, and finally compares a constructed value to `10` raised to the power of `m`. Based on this comparison, it prints either "Sasha" or "Anna" for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic described in the problem statement. Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Anna's Turn (Reversing Digits):**
   - The program reverses the digits of each number in the list but does not handle the case where Anna can choose any element to reverse. The program reverses all elements and concatenates them in a specific way, which is not optimal for Anna.

2. **Sasha's Turn (Concatenating Elements):**
   - The program does not allow Sasha to choose any two elements and concatenate them in any order. Instead, it attempts to concatenate the reversed elements in a specific alternating pattern, which is not optimal for Sasha.

3. **Game End Condition:**
   - The program does not simulate the turns correctly. It should alternate turns between Anna and Sasha, with Anna reversing a number and Sasha concatenating two numbers, until only one number is left. The current implementation does not handle the game logic correctly.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program does not consider the optimal play for both players. It simply reverses all numbers and concatenates them in a specific way, which does not guarantee the optimal outcome for either player.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when the list has only one element or when all elements are single-digit numbers.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Anna
```

**Explanation:**
- Anna can reverse any number, but let's say she reverses `56` to `65`.
- Sasha can then concatenate `9` and `1` to form `91` or `19`.
- Sasha can concatenate `91` and `65` to form `9165` or `6591`, both of which are greater than `10^5`.
- However, Sasha can also concatenate `19` and `65` to form `1965` or `6519`, both of which are greater than `10^5`.
- In this case, Sasha wins, but the expected output is `Anna` because Sasha cannot form a number greater than `10^5` if Anna plays optimally.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
