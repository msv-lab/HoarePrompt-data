The given code snippet reverses the string representation of `x` (which is `operational_list[2]`) and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to `x_rev`. This operation does not affect any other variables directly mentioned in the initial state except for `x_rev`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input by spaces and must contain at least two elements, `x` is `operational_list[2]`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `operational_list[2]`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x_rev` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `operational_list[2]`.**
