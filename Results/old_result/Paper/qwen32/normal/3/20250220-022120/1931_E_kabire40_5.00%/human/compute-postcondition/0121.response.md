Postcondition: **`rev_res` is `rev_res + x_next` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x_current` and `x_current > 10`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is `2 * x_current` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x` and `x_current > 10`, otherwise `rev_res` is `x_current`. `y` is incremented by 1. `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x_current` and the reverse of `x_next` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x_current`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x_current`. `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x` is now `x_next`, and `x_rev` is `int(x_next[::-1])`.**
