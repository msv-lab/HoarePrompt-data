Postcondition: **`rev_res` is the concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, followed by the processed elements of `rev_val`. If `rev_res` is greater than `10` raised to the power of `max_power`, then `rev_res` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `rev_res` does not exceed `10` raised to the power of `max_power`.**
