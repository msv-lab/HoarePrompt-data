Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_res` is an empty string; `y` is [previous value of y] + 1; `rev_val` is an empty list; `list_len` is the first value from the input; `max_power` is the second value from the input; `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rev_res` is `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string. `y` is [previous value of y] + 1, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, otherwise `rev_val` is an empty list. `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, and `x_rev` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rev_res` is `2 * x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x` and `x > 10`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is `x`. `y` is [previous value of y] + 1. `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is an empty list if `x_rev` was not equal to `x` in length; otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`. `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, and `x_rev` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rev_res` is `rev_res + x_next` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x_current` and `x_current > 10`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is `2 * x_current` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x` and `x_current > 10`, otherwise `rev_res` is `x_current`. `y` is incremented by 1. `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x_current` and the reverse of `x_next` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x_current`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x_current`. `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x` is now `x_next`, and `x_rev` is `int(x_next[::-1])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
