Postcondition: **`rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the reverse of `val_in`. `y` is `y_initial + n`. `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]` and must have at least one element. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values. `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the element at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is odd.**
