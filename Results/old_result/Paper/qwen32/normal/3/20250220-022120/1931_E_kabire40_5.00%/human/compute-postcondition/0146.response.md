Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `rev_res` is constructed based on specific conditions from `operational_list` and `rev_val`.
- `y` is calculated as `y_initial + n`.
- `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where the string and its reverse are not the same length.
- `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the string `'Sasha'`. It does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`rev_res`, `y`, `rev_val`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`).

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
