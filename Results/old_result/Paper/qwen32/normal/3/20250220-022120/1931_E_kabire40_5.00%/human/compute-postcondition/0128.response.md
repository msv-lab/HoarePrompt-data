Postcondition: **`rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`, `y` is `y_initial + n`, `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]` and must have at least one element, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values, and `x` is an odd integer**
