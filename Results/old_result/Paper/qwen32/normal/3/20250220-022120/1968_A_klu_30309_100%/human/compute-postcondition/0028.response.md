The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again for the next `x`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the last processed element of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `test_cases` to be processed. Therefore, `x` should be the next element in `test_cases`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that the last `x` was processed, and we need to move to the next `x` in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Since the exact value of the next `x` is not specified, we can denote it as the next element in `test_cases` after the previously processed one. If we assume the list is indexed, and the previous `x` was at index `i`, then the next `x` would be at index `i+1`.

However, since we are not given the current index, we'll just denote the next `x` as the next element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.
