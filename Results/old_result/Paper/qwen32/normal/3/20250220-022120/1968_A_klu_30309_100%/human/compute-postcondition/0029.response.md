The code snippet sets `max_sum` to 0. This change impacts the variable `max_sum` directly. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.
