Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `max_sum` is the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` and `y` values, `best_y` is the `y` value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last element in `test_cases` that was processed, `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke, and `results` now includes the `best_y` value for the last `x` processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` processed, `max_sum` is the maximum sum found for the last `x` processed, `best_y` is the value of `y` that gave the maximum sum for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last `x` processed, `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke, and `gcd_val` and `current_sum` are the values from the last iteration for the last `x` processed. The `results` list now includes the `best_y` value from the last processed `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
