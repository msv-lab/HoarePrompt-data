The `print(2)` statement in the provided Python code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs the integer `2`. This value is explicitly given in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `v`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
