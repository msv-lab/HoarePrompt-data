The code snippet initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` zeros. This means that `v` will have `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers, all initialized to 0.**
