To determine the final output state after the loop completes all iterations, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates from `i` = 1 to `i` = `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if `v[v[v[i]]]` is equal to `i`. If it is, the program prints `2` and returns immediately. If the loop completes all iterations without finding any `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, it will simply finish the loop without printing anything.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. After the 1st iteration, `v[v[v[1]]]` is not equal to 1.
2. After the 2nd iteration, `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2.
3. After the 3rd iteration, `v[v[v[3]]]` is not equal to 3.

From this, we can infer that for `i` = 1, 2, and 3, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` was not met. Since the loop continues without returning, the same must be true for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

Thus, the loop completes all `n` iterations without finding any `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, and it will not print anything.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations without printing anything.**
