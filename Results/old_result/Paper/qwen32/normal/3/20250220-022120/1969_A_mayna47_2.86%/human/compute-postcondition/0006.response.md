The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(1, n + 1)`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. Given the constraints, `n` is already specified to be an integer such that `2 <= n <= 50` and `n` is not equal to 2, which means `n` can take any value from 3 to 50. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` is the loop variable and it starts at 1, so it does not need to be adjusted either. The other variables `t`, `p`, and `v` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n and `p_i` != i; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the values provided in the input.**
