Output State: **The program returns `cnt`, which is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`**.

This means the program calculates a sum for each integer `i` from 1 to `m` based on the provided formula and returns this sum as `cnt`.
