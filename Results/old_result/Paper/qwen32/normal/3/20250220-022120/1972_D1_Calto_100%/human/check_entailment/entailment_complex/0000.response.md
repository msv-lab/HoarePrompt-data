Reasoning:  
The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). 

Let's analyze the functions:

1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the GCD is not used in the provided `func_2` implementation, so we can focus on `func_2` for the correctness of the solution.

2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement. The logic in `func_2` seems to be derived from a mathematical observation or transformation of the problem, rather than a brute-force approach. The formula used inside the loop is not immediately obvious, and it's crucial to verify if it correctly counts the valid pairs.

The formula inside the loop is:
```
cnt = cnt + math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)
```
This formula appears to be counting the number of valid `a` values for each `b = i` from 1 to `m`. The term `i * i` and `i * i - i` seem to be related to the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the exact derivation is not provided. 

Given the problem constraints (with `n` and `m` up to 2 * 10^6), a brute-force approach would be inefficient, so an optimized approach like the one in `func_2` is necessary.

The provided output for the example cases matches the expected results, which is a good sign. However, without a rigorous mathematical proof of the correctness of the formula used in `func_2`, we can only rely on the provided test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the fact that the output matches the expected results for the provided test cases, we can reasonably assume that the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
