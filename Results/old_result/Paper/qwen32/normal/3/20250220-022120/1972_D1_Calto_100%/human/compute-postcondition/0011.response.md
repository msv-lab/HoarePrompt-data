Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The value of `i` also remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `x` is recalculated as `n - (i * i - i)`, and `y` is assigned the value of `i * i`.
