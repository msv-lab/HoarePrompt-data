### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code and Function Summaries:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This function is not used in `func_2`, so it is irrelevant for the current assessment.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the problem's conditions.
   - The function summary suggests that `func_2` computes a sum involving `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The formula used in `func_2` does not directly relate to the problem's condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but the variables `x` and `y` do not correctly represent the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `gcd(a, b)`.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

#### Comparison with Provided Code:
- The provided code (`func_2`) does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- It uses an incorrect formula and logic to count the valid pairs, failing to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to count the valid pairs correctly for all cases.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect.
