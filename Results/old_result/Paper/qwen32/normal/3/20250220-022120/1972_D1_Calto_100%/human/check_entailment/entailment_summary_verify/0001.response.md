### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Code Recap:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_2(n, m)` is described as returning the sum of \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil + (x \% y == 0)\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), where \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).

#### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`:
- The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem statement. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked.
- The function initializes `cnt` to \(-1\), which is incorrect. It should start from 0.
- The calculations inside the loop do not correspond to the problem's requirement.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here's a correct implementation outline:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the line below to run the main function
# main()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program, particularly `func_2(n, m)`, does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the program's incorrectness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
