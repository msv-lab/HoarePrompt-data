Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program provided contains two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function is supposed to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\). The implementation is correct as it uses the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the implementation seems incorrect based on the problem statement.

Let's break down `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function initializes `cnt` to \(-1\), which is not the correct initial count.
- It then iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It updates `cnt` by adding \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{y} \right\rceil + (x \% y == 0)\).

This logic does not correctly reflect the problem's conditions. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked correctly.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation outline:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the line below to run the main function
# main()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
