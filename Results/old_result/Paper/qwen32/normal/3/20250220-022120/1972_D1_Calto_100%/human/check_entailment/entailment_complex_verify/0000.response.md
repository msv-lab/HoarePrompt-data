### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **GCD Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but the values of `x` and `y` do not accurately reflect the condition required to solve the problem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This is demonstrated in the correct implementation provided in the original assessment.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations in the provided code indicate that `func_2` is summing a specific expression for each `i` from 1 to `m`. However, this expression does not correspond to the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The annotations show the state of variables at certain points, but they do not validate the overall correctness of the logic used to count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not accurately check the condition for valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.
