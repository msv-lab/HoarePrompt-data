Let's analyze the given Python program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of Provided Functions:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The output hints correctly describe this functionality.
   - This function seems correct and is not directly used in `func_2`, which is the main function for solving the problem.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function calculates a count based on a loop that iterates from 1 to `m`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then updates the count `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Correctness of `func_2`:
Let's verify if the logic in `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements.

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten using the properties of GCD. If we let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = d \cdot k\) and \(b = d \cdot l\) where \(\gcd(k, l) = 1\). The condition becomes:

\[a + b = d \cdot k + d \cdot l = d \cdot (k + l)\]

For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\):

\[d \cdot (k + l) = d \cdot l \cdot m \Rightarrow k + l = l \cdot m\]

This simplifies to:

\[k + l = l \cdot m \Rightarrow k = l \cdot (m - 1)\]

Given \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), we need to count valid pairs \((a, b)\). The provided function `func_2` seems to be attempting to count these pairs based on some derived formula involving `i` from 1 to `m`.

However, the provided formula in `func_2` does not directly match the derived condition \(k = l \cdot (m - 1)\). Instead, it is counting something related to the ceiling of a division and a modulo operation, which does not directly translate to the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The formula used in `func_2` does not align with the derived mathematical condition for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
