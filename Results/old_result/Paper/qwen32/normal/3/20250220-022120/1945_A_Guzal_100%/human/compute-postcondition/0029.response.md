Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is the previous value of `k` plus `a + (b + c) // 3` plus 1. Otherwise, `k` remains the previous value of `k` plus `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
