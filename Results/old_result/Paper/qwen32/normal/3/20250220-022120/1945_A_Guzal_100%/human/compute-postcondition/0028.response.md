The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `k` is the previous value of `k` plus `a + (b + c) // 3` plus 1.**
