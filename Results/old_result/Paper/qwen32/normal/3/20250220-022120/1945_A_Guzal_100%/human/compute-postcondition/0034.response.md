Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `k` based on the conditions involving `b` and `c`. If `b` modulo 3 is not zero and the sum of `b` and `c` modulo 3 is less than 3, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a` plus the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3, and if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, it increments `k` by 1. The function prints the calculated `k` for each test case.**
