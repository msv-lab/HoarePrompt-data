The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is directly specified by the code.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print(-1)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `-1`.

Given that the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
