Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0. If `b` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `b % 3` and `c` is less than 3, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3` if the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3, otherwise `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.**
