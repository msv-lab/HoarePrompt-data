The value of `k` is incremented by `a + (b + c) // 3`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.**
