The code snippet takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0. The code overwrites the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` with the input values, but the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0.**
