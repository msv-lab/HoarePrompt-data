The code snippet provided sets `k` to 0, regardless of the conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `k` changes to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `k` is 0.**
