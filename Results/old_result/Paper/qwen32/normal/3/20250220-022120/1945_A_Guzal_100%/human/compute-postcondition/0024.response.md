The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `k`) is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k` + `a` + (`b` + `c`) // 3, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is incremented by 1.**
