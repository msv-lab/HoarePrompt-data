Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is 1 and `a[j]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F'. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 3 if `x[0]` is 'S' and `b[j]` is 1; otherwise, `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 2 if `x[0]` is 'S'. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the value of the user's input. `j` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering the condition `x[j - 1] == 'S'` and the updates made to `b` accordingly.
