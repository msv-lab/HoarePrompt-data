To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how `nx` is constructed.

### Initial State:
- `nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1` and `j` from 1 to `n`.

### Construction of `nx`:
- For each `i` from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive), the character `xx[i][j - 1]` is appended to `nx` for each `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- This means for each `i`, we are taking the character at index `j - 1` from the `i-th` row of the 2D list `xx` and appending it to `nx`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume `n = 3` and `xx` is a 3x3 matrix:
```
xx = [
    ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ['d', 'e', 'f'],
    ['g', 'h', 'i']
]
```
- For `i = 0` and `j` from 1 to 3:
  - `j = 1`: `xx[0][0]` -> 'a'
  - `j = 2`: `xx[0][1]` -> 'b'
  - `j = 3`: `xx[0][2]` -> 'c'
- For `i = 1` and `j` from 1 to 3:
  - `j = 1`: `xx[1][0]` -> 'd'
  - `j = 2`: `xx[1][1]` -> 'e'
  - `j = 3`: `xx[1][2]` -> 'f'
- For `i = 2` and `j` from 1 to 3:
  - `j = 1`: `xx[2][0]` -> 'g'
  - `j = 2`: `xx[2][1]` -> 'h'
  - `j = 3`: `xx[2][2]` -> 'i'

Thus, `nx` would be constructed as: `'abc' + 'def' + 'ghi'` which results in `'abcdefghi'`.

### General Case:
Given the general form, `nx` will be a concatenation of all characters from the 2D list `xx` where for each row `i`, we take characters from index `0` to `n-1`.

### Output Description:
The value of `nx` is a string that is constructed by concatenating the characters from the 2D list `xx` following the specified conditions.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed by concatenating characters from xx[i][j - 1] for each i from 0 to n-1 and j from 1 to n)**
