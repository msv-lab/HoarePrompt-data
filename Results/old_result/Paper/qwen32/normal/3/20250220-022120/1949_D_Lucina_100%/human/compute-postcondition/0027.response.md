The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `b[3]` is incremented by 1.

Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is 1, and `a[2]` is incremented by 1 if `x[1]` is 'F'
- `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 3 if `x[0]` is 'S', or 1 if `x[0]` is not 'S', and `b[2]` is set to 1 if `x[1]` is 'S', incrementing it from its initial value of 2 to 3 if `x[0]` is 'S'
- `xx` is a list containing a single empty string
- `x` is the value of the user's input
- `j` is 3

Since `j` is 3, `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `b[3]` will be `b[3] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is 1, and `a[2]` is incremented by 1 if `x[1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` which is 3 if `x[0]` is 'S', or 1 if `x[0]` is not 'S', and `b[2]` is set to 1 if `x[1]` is 'S', incrementing it from its initial value of 2 to 3 if `x[0]` is 'S', and `b[3]` is incremented by 1, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the value of the user's input, `j` is 3**.
