To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and how it modifies the `nx` variable based on the conditions provided.

The code snippet is:
```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column.
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column.
- `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input.
- `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.
- `t` is the length of `sa`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `j` is 3.

The specific condition for modifying `nx` is based on whether `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' or not:
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the original `nx` with `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is the original `nx` with 'F' appended to it if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended to it.

Since the code snippet directly appends `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx` without any conditional checks, we can infer that the condition for `xx[i][j - 1]` being '?' is not being evaluated in this snippet. Therefore, `nx` will simply have `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original `nx` with `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it.**
