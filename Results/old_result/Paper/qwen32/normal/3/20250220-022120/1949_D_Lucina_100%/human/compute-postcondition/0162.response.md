The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing string `nx`. Since the initial value of `nx` is determined based on the conditions provided and then 'F' is appended to it, the final value of `nx` will be the initial value of `nx` with 'F' added at the end.

Given the initial state, `nx` is either:
- The character `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.
- 'F' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.
- 'S' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.

After the operation `nx += 'F'`, the value of `nx` will be:
- The character `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.
- 'FF' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.
- 'SF' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `t`, `n`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'`, 'FF', or 'SF' based on the conditions provided.**
