The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing string `nx`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `t`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'F' appended to it.**
