The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range it is iterating over, which is from 1 to `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the value it had at the start of the last iteration. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, to start the next iteration, `j` should be one less than its value at the end of the last iteration.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `j` to its value at the start of that iteration, which is one less than its current value.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j - 1` (where `j` is the value at the end of the previous iteration)**

To make it more concrete, if `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 4.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration**
