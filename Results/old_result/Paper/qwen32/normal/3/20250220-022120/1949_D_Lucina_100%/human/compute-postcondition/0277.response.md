The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

The states of `i`, `n`, and `nx` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration), `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`**.
