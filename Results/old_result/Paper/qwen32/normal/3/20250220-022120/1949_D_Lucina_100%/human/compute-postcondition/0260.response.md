Output State: **`nx` is a string with 'F' appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration.**

Natural Language: The string `nx` now includes an additional character 'F' at the end. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged. The value of `j` remains the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration.
