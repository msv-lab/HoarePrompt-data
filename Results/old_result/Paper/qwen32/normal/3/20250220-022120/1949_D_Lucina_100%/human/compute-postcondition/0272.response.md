The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, it will now hold the value 'S'. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `sb`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the conditions related to them) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is 'S', `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`.**
