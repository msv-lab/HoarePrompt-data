Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no matter the order in which scenarios are played, there will never be more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row.

The current logic in the program is flawed in several ways:
1. It does not correctly handle the requirement of balancing the number of consecutive 'F' and 'S' transitions.
2. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to '?' positions is not based on ensuring the constraint of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
3. The program does not consider all possible permutations of scenarios and their corresponding transition sequences.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using graph coloring or backtracking to ensure that the constraint is met for all possible scenario permutations. The given program does not implement such an approach, and thus it is incorrect.
