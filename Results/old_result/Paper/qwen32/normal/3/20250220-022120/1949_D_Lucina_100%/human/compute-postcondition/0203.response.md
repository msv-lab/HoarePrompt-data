Postcondition: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**
