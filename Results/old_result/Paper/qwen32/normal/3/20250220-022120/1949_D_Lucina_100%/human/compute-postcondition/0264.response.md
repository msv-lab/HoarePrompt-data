To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]`.
2. If `xx[i]` contains a '?', it will be replaced by either 'S' or 'F' based on some conditions.
3. `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
4. `n` remains unchanged.
5. `j` has completed its iterations from 1 to `n`.

### Output State:
The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `nx` is constructed by iterating through a list (or string) `xx` and replacing any '?' characters with either 'S' or 'F' based on some conditions.
- The variable `i` is used as an index to access elements in `xx`.
- The variable `j` completes its iterations from 1 to `n`, but it is not directly involved in constructing `nx`.
- Since the exact conditions for replacing '?' with 'S' or 'F' are not specified, we cannot determine the exact characters that replace '?'.
- However, we can describe the final constructed string `nx` in terms of the initial string `xx` and the replacements made.

### Conclusion:
The final value of `nx` is a string where each '?' in the original string `xx` has been replaced by either 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions specified in the code (which are not detailed here).

### Output:
Output: **nx (where nx is the string constructed by replacing '?' in xx with 'S' or 'F' based on specified conditions)**
