Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `i` and `j` are each incremented by 1 from their previous values, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `xx[i][j - 1]` is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx` if `i` or `j` is found in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.**
