The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. `n` remains the same.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop. The value of `nx` does not affect the loop's continuation, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

State: **`nx` is a string, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
