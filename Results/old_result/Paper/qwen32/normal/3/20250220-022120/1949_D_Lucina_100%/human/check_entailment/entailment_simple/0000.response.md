Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and then assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters based on these counts. However, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters is flawed and does not guarantee that the solution will meet the condition of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. The program uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine which '?' characters to assign 'F' or 'S' to. This is not a valid approach to ensure the condition on consecutive videos of the same type is met. The condition depends on the sequence of videos for any permutation of scenarios, not just the initial counts and positions.

2. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters does not consider the overall sequence of videos for all possible permutations of scenarios. It only considers the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row and assigns 'F' or 'S' based on these counts.

3. The program does not ensure that the solution is valid for all permutations of scenarios. It only constructs a solution based on the initial counts and positions, which may not satisfy the condition for all permutations.

4. The program does not use a systematic approach to assign 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters to ensure the condition is met for all permutations. It uses a heuristic approach that may not always produce a valid solution.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct solution for all inputs within the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
