The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is initially an empty string, so after appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and `sb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is 'F', `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`.**
