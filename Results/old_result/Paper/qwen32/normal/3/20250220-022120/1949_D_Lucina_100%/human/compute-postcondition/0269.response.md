The value of `nx` is updated by appending the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` with `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
