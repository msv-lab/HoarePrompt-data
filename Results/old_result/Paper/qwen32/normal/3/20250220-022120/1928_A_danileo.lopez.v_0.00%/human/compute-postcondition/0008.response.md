The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. Since `t` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, and at least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.**

Note: The condition regarding `a` and `b` does not need to be adjusted because it does not affect the loop's continuation.
