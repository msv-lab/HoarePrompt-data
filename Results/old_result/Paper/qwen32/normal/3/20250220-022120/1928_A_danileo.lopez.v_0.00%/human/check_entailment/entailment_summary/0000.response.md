Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to cut a given rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from those two smaller rectangles, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are the same. 

The solution hinges on the observation that if either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles in such a way that they can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is because an even dimension allows for a cut that results in two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even, and if so, it prints "Yes", indicating that it is possible to form a new rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No", indicating that it is not possible to form a new rectangle under the given constraints.

Given the execution summary and the logic described, the program behaves as expected for all provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
