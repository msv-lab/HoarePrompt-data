Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, and at least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers. The condition checks if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, but the postcondition does not change the values of `a`, `b`, or `t` based on the if-else execution.**
