### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form another rectangle by cutting an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key insight is that for Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even. This is because:

- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, cutting the rectangle in either direction will result in two smaller rectangles with one dimension being a fraction (specifically, half of the odd dimension), which cannot be used to form a new rectangle with integer sides.
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle in such a way that the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

The annotated code confirms this behavior:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- It then checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
- If the condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The annotations also indicate that the program correctly processes each test case and outputs the appropriate result based on the condition.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle based on the given conditions.

### Final:
Final: **True**
