### Reasoning:

The problem states that Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then try to form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The key observation here is that if either dimension of the original rectangle (a or b) is even, Bob can always form another rectangle. 

Here's why:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a/2 x b`. These two smaller rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size `a x (b/2)` (or `(b/2) x a` which is considered the same).
- Similarly, if `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a x b/2`. These two smaller rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2) x b` (or `b x (a/2)` which is considered the same).
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then cutting the rectangle along either dimension will result in two smaller rectangles of dimensions that are not integers, which is not allowed. Hence, in this case, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

The given program checks if at least one of `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No", indicating that Bob cannot form another rectangle.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem requirements, and the program correctly handles the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
