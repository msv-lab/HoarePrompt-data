The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). If `a < b < c`, then `a < b < c`. If `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, then `b` is greater than `a` and `b` is greater than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c` or `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. `i` is 2**
