Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
- There are conditions specified for the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c`:
  - If `a < b < c`, then it is true that `a < b < c`.
  - If `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, then `b` is greater than `a` and `b` is greater than `c`.
- `i` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. The statement simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is the string `'NONE'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **NONE**
