The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. The statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer input provided by the user, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, with the constraint \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).
3. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'NONE'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NONE**
