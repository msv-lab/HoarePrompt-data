Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to create a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`.
3. It calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to compute the sequence.
4. The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
5. It then iterates over the list, setting each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` (which is the largest number with a bit length equal to `k`), and subtracts this value from `k`.
6. Finally, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of the list.
7. The function returns the list `nums`.

### Issues in the Program
The main issue with the program is in the logic of how it constructs the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

- The program uses `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` to fill each element of the list, which is the largest number with the same bit length as `k`. This does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
- The program does not consider distributing the bits of `k` across multiple numbers to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, we should distribute the bits of `k` across the numbers in the sequence such that each bit contributes to the OR result. One way to do this is to use the smallest possible numbers that contribute 1s to the OR result.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
