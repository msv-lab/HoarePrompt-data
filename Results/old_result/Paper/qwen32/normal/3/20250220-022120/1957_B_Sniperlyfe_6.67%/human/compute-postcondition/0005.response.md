The given code snippet sets the value of `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Since the initial state already mentions that `nums[i]` is already set to this value, executing this line of code does not change the value of `nums[i]`. Therefore, the state of `nums` remains the same, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros except `nums[i]` which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`; `k` is `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
