Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the numbers in the sequence.

Here is a brief analysis of the issue:
- The function initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
- It then iterates through the list, setting each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with the same number of bits as `k` but all set to 1.
- It decrements `k` by this number in each iteration.
- After the loop, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of the list.

This approach does not ensure that the sum of the elements in `nums` is equal to `k` or that the bitwise OR of the elements maximizes the number of 1s in its binary representation.

A correct approach would be to distribute the value of `k` among the `n` numbers in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. One possible strategy is to use powers of 2 to construct the sequence, ensuring that the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.
