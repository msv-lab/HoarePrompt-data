Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not correctly implemented to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules.

The problem can be solved using the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) from combinatorial game theory. The key insight is to compute the XOR of the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, Alice (the first player) has a winning strategy; otherwise, Bob has a winning strategy.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, piles in test_cases:
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum != 0:
            results.append("Alice")
        else:
            results.append("Bob")
    return results

# Reading input and processing test cases
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, piles))

# Determine the winner for each test case
results = determine_winner(t, test_cases)

# Print the results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly reads the input, computes the XOR of the pile sizes for each test case, and determines the winner based on whether the XOR sum is non-zero.
