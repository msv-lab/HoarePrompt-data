Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, `n` is an integer representing the number of piles such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`, and `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 2; `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**

In simpler terms: The list `a` and the integer `n` retain their original properties. The variable `winNext` is now assigned the value returned by the function `func_2` when called with the arguments `a[1:]` (which is the list `a` excluding its first element) and `n - 1` (which is one less than the original value of `n`).
