The `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module modifies the list `a` such that each element at index `i` is the sum of the elements from the start of the list up to index `i`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input. After applying `accumulate`, `a[i]` will be the cumulative sum of the list elements up to index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.**
