Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is 0, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, and all `q` queries have been processed, resulting in 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each query.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `q` will be 0 because all queries have been processed. The other variables such as `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state as they are not modified within the loop. For each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO' will have been printed based on the conditions specified in the loop.
