You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `b` Array:**
   - The `b` array is supposed to be an array of positive integers such that the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray of `a` and `a[i] != b[i]` for every index `i`.
   - The current implementation of `b` sets `b[i]` to `b[i - 1] + x` where `x` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `a[i]`. This does not ensure that the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of the subarray of `a` and that `a[i] != b[i]` for every index `i`.

2. **Incorrect Condition for "Good" Subarray:**
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is used to determine if a subarray is not "good". However, this condition does not correctly check the three conditions required for a subarray to be "good".
   - The condition `x == y` is also used, which is incorrect because a subarray of length 1 can still be "good" if `a[i] != 1` (since `b[i]` can be set to 1).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
2 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- The subarray is `[2, 2, 2]`.
- We can construct `b` as `[1, 1, 1]` which satisfies:
  1. \(\sum a_i = \sum b_i = 6\)
  2. \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\)
  3. \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\)

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

This is because the code does not correctly handle the construction of `b` and the condition for determining if the subarray is "good".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
