Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is `q - 1`, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, and a value ('YES' or 'NO') has been returned.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and the previously returned value ('YES' or 'NO') remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are updated to the first and second integers from the new input, respectively.
