### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Sum Equality:** The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of a new array `b` of the same length where each element is positive.
2. **Element Inequality:** Each element in the subarray should not be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. **Positive Elements:** All elements in `b` should be positive.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The array `a` is converted into a prefix sum array, where `a[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array `c`.
   - The array `b` is created such that `b[i]` is the sum of `1` if `c[i] > 1`, otherwise `2`. This is then converted into a prefix sum array as well.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) in `a` is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - If the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b`, it prints "NO".
   - If `l_i == r_i`, it prints "NO" because a single element cannot be unequal to itself while maintaining the sum condition.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition for "YES":**
   - The program checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is greater than or equal to the sum of the subarray in `b`. However, this does not ensure that each element in the subarray is unequal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - For example, if the subarray is `[2, 1]`, the sum condition might be satisfied, but the elements are not unequal because `2` is not unequal to `1` (since `b` would have `1` for both elements).

2. **Element Inequality Condition:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if each element in the subarray is unequal to the corresponding element in `b`. It only checks the sum condition, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the condition that each element in the subarray should be unequal to the corresponding element in `b`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
