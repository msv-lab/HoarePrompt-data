Reasoning:  
The provided code is intended to solve the problem of assigning integers to vertices of a graph and partitioning it into the minimum number of cliques based on the given conditions. However, there are some issues with the implementation that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Assignment of `arr` and `cliquess`**: The function `make_array` modifies the global lists `arr` and `cliquess`, but these lists are not defined within the scope of `make_array`. This is a potential issue if the code were to be run as-is, as `arr` and `cliquess` would need to be defined in the global scope or passed as arguments to `make_array`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**: The calculation of `cliques` as `ceil(n / k)` is not necessarily correct for the problem. The number of cliques should be determined based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices. The provided code does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on this condition.

3. **Incorrect Filling of `arr` and `cliquess`**: The `make_array` function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` lists in a way that does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The assignment of values to `arr` and the corresponding clique numbers to `cliquess` should be based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

4. **Incorrect Output**: The output of the code does not match the expected format. The first line should contain a permutation of integers from 1 to n, the second line should contain the number of cliques, and the third line should contain the clique numbers for each vertex. The provided code does not guarantee that the output will meet these requirements.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
