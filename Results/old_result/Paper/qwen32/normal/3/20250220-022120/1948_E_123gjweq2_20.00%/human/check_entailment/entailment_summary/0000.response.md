### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function initializes the number of cliques (`cliques`) as the ceiling of `n / k`. This is an attempt to partition the vertices into groups such that each group can potentially form a clique.
   - It initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros, which are supposed to hold the values assigned to the vertices and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - It then iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` for each segment.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills a segment of the `arr` array with consecutive integers, starting from `left + 1` and increasing until the midpoint of the segment.
   - It then fills the second half of the segment with consecutive decreasing integers, starting from `right + 1`.
   - It also assigns the same clique number to all elements in the segment in the `cliquess` array.

### Issues:
- **Initialization of `arr` and `cliquess`**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are defined inside `func_1` but are used in `make_array` without being passed as arguments. This will lead to a `NameError` because `make_array` does not have access to these variables.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The logic for filling `arr` ensures that the values are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`. However, the logic for forming cliques is flawed. The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not being directly checked or enforced.
- **Output**: The function is supposed to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, but the current implementation does not guarantee this. The current approach of dividing vertices into segments and assigning values does not ensure that all pairs within a segment satisfy the edge condition.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to form the minimum number of cliques and ensure that the edge condition is satisfied. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
