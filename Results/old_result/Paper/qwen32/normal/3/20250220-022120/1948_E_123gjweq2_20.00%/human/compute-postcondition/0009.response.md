The given code snippet is `cliquess[left + i] = clique`. This line assigns the value of `clique` to the index `left + i` in the `cliquess` array. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the value of `i` in this context is the value it had before the increment plus one.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr).
- `clique` is an integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The line `cliquess[left + i] = clique` reassigns the value at `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. However, since `cliquess[left + i]` was already `clique` before this line, the value does not change. The increment of `i` before this line means that `i` is now one more than its previous value, but the assignment itself does not change the value of `clique` at the specified index.

Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the fact that `i` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
