The given code snippet is:
```
cliquess[left + i] = clique
```

This line of code updates the value at the index `left + i` in the list `cliquess` to be equal to the value of `clique`. 

The precondition specifies that `cliquess[left + i]` was initially `clique`, meaning the value at this index is not actually being changed by the code snippet. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is `i + 1`**
