The code provided assigns the value of `clique` to the `i`-th element of the `cliquess` list starting from the `left` index. This means `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given context, so we can only describe the general impact of the assignment.

Since `i` is not specified, we can only state that the element at position `left + i` in the `cliquess` list is set to `clique`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
