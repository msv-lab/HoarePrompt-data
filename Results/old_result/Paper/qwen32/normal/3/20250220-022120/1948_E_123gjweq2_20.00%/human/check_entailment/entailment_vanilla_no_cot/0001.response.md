Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Assign integers to vertices in a graph and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
- **Graph Construction**: An edge exists between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
- **Output**:
  - An array of integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\).
  - The number of cliques \(q\).
  - An array \(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n\) indicating the clique each vertex belongs to.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To assign integers to vertices and partition them into cliques.
   - **Variables**:
     - `cliques`: Number of cliques, calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - `arr`: Array to store the integer assignments.
     - `cliquess`: Array to store the clique assignments.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function iterates over the number of calculated cliques and calls `make_array` for each.
     - `make_array` is supposed to populate `arr` and `cliquess` with appropriate values.
     - After processing, it prints `arr`, the number of cliques, and `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To assign values to vertices within a specified range and assign them to a specific clique.
   - **Variables**:
     - `small_element` and `big_element`: Define the range of values to assign.
     - `mid` and `not_mid`: Calculate the midpoint and the remaining elements.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function assigns values from `small_element` to `mid` and from `big_element` down to `mid + 1` to the vertices in the range `[left, right]`.
     - It assigns the same clique number to all these vertices.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used in `make_array` but are defined in `func_1`. This is a problem because `make_array` does not receive these arrays as arguments and does not return them. This means the arrays are not properly updated.

2. **Assignment Logic**:
   - The assignment logic in `make_array` seems to be incorrect for the problem. It assigns values in a specific pattern but does not ensure that the edge condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - The partitioning into cliques based on the calculated number of cliques (`ceil(n / k)`) is also questionable. The actual number of cliques needed might be different based on the edge condition.

3. **Printing**:
   - The program prints the arrays directly from the function `func_1`, which means the arrays might not have been updated correctly due to the issue mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues with global variables and the incorrect assignment logic. The number of cliques and the partitioning might not meet the requirements based on the edge condition.

**Correctness: False**
