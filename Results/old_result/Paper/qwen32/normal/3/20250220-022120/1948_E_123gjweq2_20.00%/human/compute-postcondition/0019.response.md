The provided code snippet sets the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so this operation specifically sets `cliquess[left + mid]` to `clique`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged as integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`.
- `clique` remains unchanged as an integer.
- `small_element` remains `left + 1`.
- `big_element` remains `right + 1`.
- `mid` remains `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
- `not_mid` remains `(right - left + 2) // 2`.
- The values of `arr[left + i]` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1` remain `small_element + i`.
- The values of `cliquess[left + i]` for `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1` are updated such that `cliquess[left + mid]` is now `clique` and all other values remain `clique`.
- `arr[left + mid]` remains `big_element`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` for `i` from `1` to `not_mid - 1` remains `big_element - i`.
- `i` remains `0`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, `clique` is an integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` from `1` to `not_mid - 1`, `i` is 0.**
