To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to check whether the program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Let's analyze the code step by step.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
    - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
    - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`, with zeros.
    - It then iterates over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` for each segment of the array.
    - Finally, it prints the array `arr`, the number of cliques, and the array `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
    - This function is supposed to fill the segment of `arr` from `left` to `right` with values and the corresponding clique number in `cliquess`.
    - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` as the starting and ending values for the segment.
    - It calculates `mid` and `not_mid` which are used to distribute the values in the segment.
    - It fills the first half of the segment with increasing values starting from `small_element` and the second half with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variables**:
    - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them as global. This will result in an error because Python treats variables defined inside functions as local unless explicitly declared as global.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
    - The logic used to assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` in `make_array` does not guarantee that the resulting graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The assignment of values does not consider the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices.

3. **Output Format**:
    - The problem requires distinct integers from 1 to n to be assigned to the vertices. The current implementation does not ensure this.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as it does not ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques and does not guarantee that the integers assigned to the vertices are distinct and within the range [1, n].

**Correctness: False**
