Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input. If `h` is `'00'`, then `h1` is `'12'`, `m1` is `m`, and `time` is `'AM'`. Otherwise, `h1` is `h`, `m1` is `m`, and `time` remains `''`.**
