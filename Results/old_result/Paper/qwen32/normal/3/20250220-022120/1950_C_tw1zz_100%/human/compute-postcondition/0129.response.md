The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '01', `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.
