Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `m1` is `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or '' or 'PM'. If `h` is '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '14', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '15', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '16', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '17', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is `h` and `time` remains ''.**
