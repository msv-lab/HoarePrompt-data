Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` is equal to '15', `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is '03', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `time` is an empty string.**

In simpler terms, the value of `h1` has been updated to '03', while all other variables retain their initial values.
