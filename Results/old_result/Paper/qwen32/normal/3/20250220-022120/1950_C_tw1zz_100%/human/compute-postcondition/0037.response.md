The code assigns the value `'09'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` equals '09', `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is `'09'`, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `time` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` equals '09', `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is `'09'`, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `time` is an empty string**.
