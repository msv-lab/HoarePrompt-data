#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, the input is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is a two-digit integer from "00" to "23" representing the hour, and mm is a two-digit integer from "00" to "59" representing the minute.

    #State: A series of printed lines, each in the format "h1:m time", representing the converted time for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will hold the values from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time string in the format "hh:mm". It then converts this 24-hour format time to a 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the result. The final state of the program is a series of printed lines, each showing the converted time for the corresponding test case.
