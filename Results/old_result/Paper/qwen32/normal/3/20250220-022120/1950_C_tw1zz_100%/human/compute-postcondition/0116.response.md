Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06'. `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`. If `h` equals '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` equals '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '14', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '15', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '16', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '17', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is none of the above, `h1` is an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
