### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly handles the conversion of time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading each time in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Conversion Logic**: For each time, it splits the input into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`). It then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map the 24-hour hour (`h`) to the corresponding 12-hour hour (`h1`), taking into account whether it should be AM or PM.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Midnight (00:00)**: Correctly maps to "12:00 AM".
   - **Midday (12:00)**: Correctly maps to "12:00 PM".
   - **Hours 1 to 11**: Correctly maps to the same hour with "AM".
   - **Hours 13 to 23**: Correctly maps to the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format with "PM".

4. **Output**: The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that the leading zeroes are preserved.

5. **Example Verification**: The annotated example provided in the problem description matches the expected output, which further confirms the correctness of the program.

There are no logical errors in the program, and it handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description.
