Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new input, `m` is the minute part of the new input, `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h1` is '02' if `h` is '14'. If `h` is '15' or any of '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. Otherwise, `time` is '' and `h1` is ''.**
