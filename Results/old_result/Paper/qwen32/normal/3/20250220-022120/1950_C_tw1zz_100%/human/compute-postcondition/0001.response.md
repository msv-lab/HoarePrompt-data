The code takes the first call to `input()` which returns `t` and then splits it on the colon `:` character. The resulting parts are converted to strings and assigned to `h` and `m` respectively. Since `t` is an integer representing minutes in the range 1 to 1440, `h` will be the hour part and `m` will be the minute part of the time represented by `t`.

Given the constraints, `h` will be a string representation of an hour in the range 0 to 23, and `m` will be a string representation of minutes in the range 00 to 59.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t`, and `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`.**
