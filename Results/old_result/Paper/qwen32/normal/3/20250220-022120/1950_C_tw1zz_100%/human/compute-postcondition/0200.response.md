To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to evaluate the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` based on the initial state provided.

1. **`h` and `m`**:
   - `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input.
   - `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input.
   - `m1` is set to `m`, but `m1` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **`h1` and `time`**:
   - These are determined based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '03' to '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12 with leading zero if necessary, and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - For any other value of `h`, `h1` is `h` and `time` remains ''.

Given these rules, the output of the `print` statement will vary based on the specific value of `h` and `m`.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `h` is '05' and `m` is '30':
  - `h1` will be '05' and `time` will be 'AM'.
  - Output: **05:30 AM**

- If `h` is '13' and `m` is '45':
  - `h1` will be '01' (since 13 - 12 = 1, and we need the leading zero) and `time` will be 'PM'.
  - Output: **01:45 PM**

- If `h` is '23' and `m` is '15':
  - `h1` will be '11' (since 23 - 12 = 11) and `time` will be 'PM'.
  - Output: **11:15 PM**

- If `h` is '00' and `m` is '00':
  - `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:00 AM**

### General Output:
Since we don't have specific values for `h` and `m`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:
- `h1` is determined based on the value of `h` as described above.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `time` is determined based on the value of `h` as described above.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 and time are determined based on the value of h as described above and m remains unchanged)**
