The code assigns the value of `m` to `m1` and an empty string to `h1`. The values of `t`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t`, `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`.**
