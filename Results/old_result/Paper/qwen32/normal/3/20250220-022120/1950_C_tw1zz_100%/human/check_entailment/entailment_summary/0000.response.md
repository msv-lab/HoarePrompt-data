Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly handles the conversion from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM for each test case. The logic covers all possible hour values from '00' to '23' and correctly assigns the AM/PM designation. The minutes part remains unchanged and is correctly included in the output. The program also handles the special cases of '00' (midnight) and '12' (noon) appropriately. The output format matches the requirement, and leading zeros are preserved in the hour part of the output.

Correctness: **True**
