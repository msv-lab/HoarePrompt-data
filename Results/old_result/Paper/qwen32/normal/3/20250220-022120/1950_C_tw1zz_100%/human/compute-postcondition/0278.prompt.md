Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, the input is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is a two-digit integer from "00" to "23" representing the hour, and mm is a two-digit integer from "00" to "59" representing the minute.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t`, and `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is any other valid hour from '02' to '23' or '00', `h1` is adjusted accordingly and `time` is set to 'AM' for hours '02' to '11' and '00', and to 'PM' for hours '12' to '23'. If `h` is none of the above, `h1` is an empty string and `time` remains an empty string. `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t` in all cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `m1` is `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' or ''. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03' to '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12 with leading zero if necessary, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For any other value of `h`, `h1` is `h` and `time` remains ''

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new input, `m` is the minute part of the new input, `m1` is `m`. If `h` is '01', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '01'. Otherwise, if `h` is one of '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is one of '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is `h` converted to 12-hour format. If `h` is '00', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '12'. For all other values of `h` except '01' to '23', `time` is '' and `h1` is ''.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
