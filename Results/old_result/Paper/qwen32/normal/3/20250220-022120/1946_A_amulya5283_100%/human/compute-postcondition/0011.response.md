To determine the state adjustments required for the for loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the given state.

The for loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(mdx, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. We need to ensure that the range function `range(mdx, n)` produces at least one value, which means `mdx` must be less than `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1.
- `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `res` is 0.
- `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to verify that `mdx < n`. Let's analyze `mdx`:
- `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

Let's break down `mdx`:
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2`.

In both cases, `mdx` is always less than `n` because:
- For even `n`, `mdx = n // 2 - 1 < n // 2 < n`.
- For odd `n`, `mdx = n // 2 < n`.

Since `mdx` is always less than `n` for any valid `n` (given `n` is not equal to 1), the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `mdx` or `n` in terms of their relationship.

The state `t` and the list `a` do not affect the execution of the loop based on the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state does not need any specific adjustment for the loop to execute, as long as `n` is not equal to 1 (which is already given).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1; `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**
