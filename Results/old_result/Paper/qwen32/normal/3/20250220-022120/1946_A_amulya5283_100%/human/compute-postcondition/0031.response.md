The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `mdx` based on the input `n`. According to the code, `mdx` is assigned the value `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This calculation is repeated, so the value of `mdx` will be updated to this new expression.

Given the initial state, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains the integer input by the user, and `a` remains the sorted list of integers input by the user. The value of `res` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, if `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer, if `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is 0.**
