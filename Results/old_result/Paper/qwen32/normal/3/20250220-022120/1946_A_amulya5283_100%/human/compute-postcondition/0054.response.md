Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, if `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `res` is 0, and `mdx` is recalculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. Additionally, `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.**
