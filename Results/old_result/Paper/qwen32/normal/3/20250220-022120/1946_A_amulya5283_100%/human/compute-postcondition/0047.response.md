Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer input by the user. The values of `t`, `a`, `mdx`, and `res` remain as they were in the initial state, assuming `n` was already defined and `a` was sorted before this input.
