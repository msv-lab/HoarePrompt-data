The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer within the range 1 to 10^5, but this value will be overwritten by the user's input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
