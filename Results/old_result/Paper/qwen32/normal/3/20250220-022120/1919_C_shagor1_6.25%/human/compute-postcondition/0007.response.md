Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `a`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, and `a` is less than or equal to `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to `a`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
