To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`x`**: This is defined as the smallest number in the list `inp`.
2. **`y`**: This is defined as the second smallest number in the list `inp`, or `n + 1` if all numbers in `inp` are the same or if there is only one number in the list.
3. **`ans`**: This is the count of numbers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Let's analyze these definitions step by step:

- **Case 1**: If the list `inp` contains only one number, then `x` will be that number and `y` will be `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of elements in `inp`, which is 1 in this case). Therefore, `y` will be `2`. Since there are no numbers greater than both `x` and `y` (because there is only one number in the list), `ans` will be `0`.
  
- **Case 2**: If all numbers in `inp` are the same, then `x` will be that number and `y` will be `n + 1`. Again, there will be no numbers greater than both `x` and `y`, so `ans` will be `0`.
  
- **Case 3**: If the list `inp` contains at least two distinct numbers, `x` will be the smallest number, and `y` will be the second smallest number. In this case, `ans` will be the count of numbers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Given these scenarios, the output of `print(ans)` will depend on the specific values in the list `inp`. However, we can provide a general description of what `ans` represents:

- **`ans`**: The count of numbers in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest (`x`) and the second smallest (`y`) numbers in `inp`.

Since the exact list `inp` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of numbers in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest numbers in `inp`)**
