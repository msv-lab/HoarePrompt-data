Output State: **`x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, `ans` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to `a`, while the values of `x`, `ans`, `n`, `inp`, and the condition that `a` is greater than both `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
