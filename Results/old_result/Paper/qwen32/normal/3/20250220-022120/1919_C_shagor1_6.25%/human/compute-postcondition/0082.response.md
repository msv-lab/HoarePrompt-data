The given code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation that checks if `x` is equal to `y`, but it does not assign the result to any variable or perform any action based on the result. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `ans`, `n`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`.**
