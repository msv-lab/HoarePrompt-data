The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The other variables (`x`, `ans`, `n`, and `inp`) remain unchanged. Since `a` is the next element in `inp`, `y` now holds that value.

Output State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is the next element in `inp`, `ans` is unchanged, `n` is the input integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.**
