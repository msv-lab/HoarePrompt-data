The provided code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation that checks if `x` is equal to `y`. However, this comparison does not assign any value to any variable, nor does it modify any existing variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged. The comparison operation itself does not have any side effects on the state of the program in this context.

Output State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `n` retains its previous value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.**
