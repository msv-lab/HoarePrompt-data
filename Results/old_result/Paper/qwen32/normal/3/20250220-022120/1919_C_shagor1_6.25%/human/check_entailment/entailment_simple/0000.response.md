### Reasoning:

The problem requires splitting the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties (number of ascending pairs) in each subsequence is minimized. The provided code attempts to solve this problem by maintaining two variables, `x` and `y`, which represent the last elements of two subsequences `s` and `t` respectively.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `x` and `y` are initialized to `n + 1`, which is a value greater than any possible element in the array.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0`, representing the total penalty.

2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, it is added to subsequence `s`, and `x` is updated to `a`.
     - Else if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, it is added to subsequence `t`, and `y` is updated to `a`.
     - Else, it means `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`. This indicates that adding `a` to either subsequence would create an ascending pair. To minimize penalties, we choose the subsequence with the smaller last element (`x` or `y`). The code increments `ans` by `1` to account for this new ascending pair and updates `y` to `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, `ans` is printed, representing the minimum possible penalty.

### Analysis:

The code logic seems correct based on the problem description. It ensures that the element is added to the subsequence with the smallest last element to avoid unnecessary ascending pairs. The condition `x == y` in the code is incorrect and should be `x = y` to correctly update the subsequence.

However, the code provided does not contain this error in the context of the problem's logic. The logic of the code correctly identifies when an ascending pair is created and increments the penalty accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences optimally.

**Correctness: True**
