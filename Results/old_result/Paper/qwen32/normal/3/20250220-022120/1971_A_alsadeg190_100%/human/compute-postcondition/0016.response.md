To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: This is an integer with a value between 1 and 100 (inclusive). However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
2. **x**: This is the first integer from the input.
3. **y**: This is the second integer from the input.
4. **i**: This is defined as `i + 1`. However, `i` is not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.
- Since `x` and `y` are described as the first and second integers from the input, respectively, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

### Output:
The print statement will output the second integer from the input followed by the first integer from the input.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input)**
