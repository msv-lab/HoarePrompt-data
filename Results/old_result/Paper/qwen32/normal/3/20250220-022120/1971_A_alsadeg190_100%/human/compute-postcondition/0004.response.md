The `print(x, y)` statement will output the values of the variables `x` and `y` separated by a space. According to the initial state, `x` is the first integer from the input and `y` is the second integer from the input, with the condition that `x` is less than `y`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can't specify the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `x` and `y` as they are defined.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input, with x < y)**
