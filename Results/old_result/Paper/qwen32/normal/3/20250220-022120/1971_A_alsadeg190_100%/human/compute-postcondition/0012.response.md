Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is not less than `y` and `i` is `i + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, where the value of `i` is incremented by 1 only if `x` is not less than `y`, while `t`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values and relationships.
