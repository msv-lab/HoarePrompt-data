Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). This variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output of the print statement.
2. `x` is the first integer from the input.
3. `y` is the second integer from the input.
4. The condition `if x < y` is checked, but the result of this condition is not used in the print statement. The statement `i = i + 1` is also irrelevant to the print statement since `i` is not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement will output the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are not explicitly given, but they are described as the first and second integers from the input, respectively.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input)**
