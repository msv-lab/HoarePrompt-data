### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process.

The program processes each test case by checking two conditions:
1. If \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\), it calculates the divisors of \((n + x - 2)\) using the `func_1` function and checks if \((s + 2) / 2\) is a valid \( k \).
2. If \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\), it calculates the divisors of \((n - x)\) using the `func_1` function and checks if \((s + 2) / 2\) is a valid \( k \).

The `func_1` function calculates all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in ascending order.

The correctness of the program hinges on whether the conditions and the divisor calculations correctly identify all valid \( k \) values.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
2. Vasya's position \( n \) and his number \( x \) can be used to determine the possible values of \( k \).
3. The conditions \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\) ensure that the divisor calculations are valid.
4. The divisors of \((n + x - 2)\) and \((n - x)\) are calculated, and for each divisor \( s \), \((s + 2) / 2\) is checked to see if it is a valid \( k \).

The logic seems correct based on the problem description and the provided example. The program correctly identifies all possible \( k \) values by checking the conditions and calculating the divisors.
