Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined properly**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the divisors of a given number, but it is not defined in the code snippet provided. The function is called twice in the program, but it is not defined anywhere in the given code.

2. **Handling of Output**: The program does not print the result for each test case. The final output list is not printed or returned, which is necessary to provide the answer for each test case.

3. **Logic for Finding `k`**: The logic to find the possible values of `k` is incomplete and incorrect. The program attempts to find the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` but does not correctly handle the constraints and conditions described in the problem statement.

4. **Integer Division**: The program uses `/` for division, which results in a float. Since `k` must be an integer, the division should use `//` for integer division.

5. **Set Conversion**: Converting the list `output` to a set to remove duplicates is correct, but the program does not handle the conversion and printing of the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    output = set()
    
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        divisors = find_divisors((n + x - 2) // 2)
        for s in divisors:
            if s >= x:
                output.add(s + 1)
    
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        divisors = find_divisors((n - x) // 2)
        for s in divisors:
            if s >= x:
                output.add(s + 1)
    
    print(len(output))
```

This corrected version properly defines the `find_divisors` function, correctly handles the logic for finding `k`, and prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
