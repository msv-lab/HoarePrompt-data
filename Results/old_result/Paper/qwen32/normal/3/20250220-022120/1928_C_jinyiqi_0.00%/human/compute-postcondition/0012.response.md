The code appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. Since `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, it means `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the value that gets appended to `output1` is the incremented value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is `i + 1`; `output1` contains the value of `i`**
