Postcondition: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `x % i == 0`, then `output1` has a new element appended, which is the current value of `i`, and `output2` has a new element appended, which is the integer value of `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.**
