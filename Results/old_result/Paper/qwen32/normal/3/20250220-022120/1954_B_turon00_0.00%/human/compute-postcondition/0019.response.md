The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1**.
