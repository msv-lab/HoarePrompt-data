Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is `cnt + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.**
