Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0. Additionally, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial states and values.
