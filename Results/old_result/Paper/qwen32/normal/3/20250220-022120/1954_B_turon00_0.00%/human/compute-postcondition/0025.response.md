The given code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. 

Since the initial values of `ans` and `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe the change to `ans` in terms of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
