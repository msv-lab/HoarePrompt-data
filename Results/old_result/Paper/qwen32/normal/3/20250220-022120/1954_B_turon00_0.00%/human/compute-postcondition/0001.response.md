To determine the necessary state adjustments for the provided for loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. This means we only need to consider the variable `t`.

The provided state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This state already ensures that the loop can execute because `t` is within the range that guarantees at least one iteration (since the minimum value of `t` is 1).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute, as the given state already satisfies the condition for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
