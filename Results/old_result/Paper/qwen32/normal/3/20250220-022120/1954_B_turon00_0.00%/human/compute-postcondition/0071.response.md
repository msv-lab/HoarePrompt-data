Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the input integer `n`. The current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
