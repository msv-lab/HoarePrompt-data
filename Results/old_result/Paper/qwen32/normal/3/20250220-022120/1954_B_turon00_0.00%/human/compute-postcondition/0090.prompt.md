Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    aa = set(a)
    if len(aa) == 1:
        print(-1)
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the length of the input list `a`, `a` is the input list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` if it ends the list, otherwise 0, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list `a` and is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` if the list ends with `tmp`, otherwise 0, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`, or `n` if `tmp` is the only element in the list, updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found during the loop. The value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
