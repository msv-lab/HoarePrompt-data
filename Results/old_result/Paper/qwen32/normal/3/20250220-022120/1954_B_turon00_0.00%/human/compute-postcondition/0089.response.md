To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly involved in the `print(ans)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This likely represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers read from the input. This list contains `n` elements.
4. **`tmp`**: The first element of the list `a`.
5. **`aa`**: A set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. This set is used to identify distinct elements in `a`.
6. **`cnt`**: The count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`. This variable keeps track of how many times the current sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has appeared consecutively.
7. **`ans`**: The minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found during the loop. This variable is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is the result of a loop that iterates through the list `a`, counting consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updating `ans` whenever a new minimum count is found.
- Since `ans` is defined as the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`, the printed value will be the smallest such count found in the list `a`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found during the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to tmp found during the loop)**
