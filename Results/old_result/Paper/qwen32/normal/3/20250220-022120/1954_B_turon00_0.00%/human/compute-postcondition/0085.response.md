The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 5, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 5, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is either 2 or 0**.
