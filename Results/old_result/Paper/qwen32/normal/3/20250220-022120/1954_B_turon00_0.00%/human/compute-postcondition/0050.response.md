The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, after the execution of this code, the value of `cnt` is 0 while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**
