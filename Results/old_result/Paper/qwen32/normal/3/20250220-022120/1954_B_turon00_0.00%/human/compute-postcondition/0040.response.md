To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the variables `i` and `n` are relevant.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `n`:** This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an input integer, so we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

2. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop counter and is automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because it will be set to 0 by the loop itself.

Given the initial state and the loop head, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is `n`**
