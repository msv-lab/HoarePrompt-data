The `print(-1)` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The value `-1` is explicitly given in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

Here is the breakdown:
- The variable `t` represents an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The variable `n` is an input integer.
- The variable `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The variable `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
- The variable `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
- The variable `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` if it ends the list, otherwise 0.
- The variable `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list `a` and is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print(-1)` statement. The statement simply prints `-1`.

Output: **-1**
