Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `answers` is a list that has been updated based on the conditions provided and now includes 'Draw', `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception that the `answers` list now includes an additional element, the string `'Draw'`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
