Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'` if `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise `answers` contains the string `'Alice'`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'` if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise `answers` contains the string `'Alice'`.**
