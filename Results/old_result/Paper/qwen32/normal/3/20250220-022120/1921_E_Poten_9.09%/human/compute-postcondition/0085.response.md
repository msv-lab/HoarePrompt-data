The code snippet appends the string `'Draw'` to the `answers` list. Therefore, the `answers` list now includes an additional element `'Draw'`. The other variables such as `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `answers` is a list that has been updated with an additional element `'Draw'`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
