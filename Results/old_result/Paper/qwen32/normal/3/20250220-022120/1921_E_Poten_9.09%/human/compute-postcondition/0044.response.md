Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` equals `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input. Additionally, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even while the other is odd. The current value of `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`.**
