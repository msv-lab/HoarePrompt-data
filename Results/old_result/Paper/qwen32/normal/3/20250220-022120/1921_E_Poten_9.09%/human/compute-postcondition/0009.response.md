The code snippet appends the string `'Bob'` to the `answers` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Bob'`, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, and `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`.**
