The given Python code snippet appends the string 'Bob' to the `answers` list. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers, and `i` is `i + 1`. The only variable that changes as a result of the code execution is `answers`, which gains a new element 'Bob'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` is a list with the new element 'Bob' appended to it.**
