Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, and either `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true.**
