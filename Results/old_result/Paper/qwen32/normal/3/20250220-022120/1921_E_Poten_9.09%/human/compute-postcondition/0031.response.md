Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. Additionally, `clues[1] - clues[3] < abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[3] - clues[5] < abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**

The `answers` list now contains the string 'Bob', while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
