Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` equals `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even while the other is odd. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains `'Alice'`. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains `'Draw'` if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` minus 1 if the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, otherwise `answers` contains `'Alice'`.**
