You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all potential cases. There are several logical errors and oversights in the code that could lead to incorrect results. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for Alice's and Bob's Moves:**
   - The code does not correctly handle the conditions under which Alice and Bob can make moves. For example, if Alice is in the last row, she cannot move down, but the code does not account for this correctly.
   - Similarly, if Bob is in the first row, he cannot move up, but the code does not account for this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Winning Conditions:**
   - The code does not correctly determine when a player can win by landing on the other player's chip. The logic for comparing the positions and determining the winner is flawed.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Draw Conditions:**
   - The code does not correctly determine when the game ends in a draw. For example, if Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row, and neither can move to the other's position, the game should end in a draw, but the code might not handle this correctly.

4. **Incorrect Use of Parity:**
   - The code uses the parity (even or odd) of the row positions to determine the winner, but this logic is not sufficient to determine the winner for all cases. The parity of the row positions does not fully capture the dynamics of the game.

Here is an example case where the program does not work correctly:

**Example Case:**
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (3, 3).
- Alice can move to (2, 1), (2, 2), or (1, 2).
- Bob can move to (2, 3), (2, 2), or (3, 2).
- No matter how Alice moves, Bob can always move to the same position on his turn, or vice versa.
- Eventually, Alice will be in the last row and Bob will be in the first row, and neither can move to the other's position, resulting in a draw.

However, the provided code might not correctly handle this case and could output an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
