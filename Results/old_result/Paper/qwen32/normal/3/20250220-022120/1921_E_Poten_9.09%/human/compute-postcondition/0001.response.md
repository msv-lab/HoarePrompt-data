Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6; `test_cases` is an integer equal to `t`; `answers` is an empty list.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` retains its value, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of six integers with specified constraints. The variable `test_cases` is set to the value of `t`. The variable `answers` is initialized as an empty list.
