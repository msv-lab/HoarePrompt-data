Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and either `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`. Additionally, one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd, and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`**
