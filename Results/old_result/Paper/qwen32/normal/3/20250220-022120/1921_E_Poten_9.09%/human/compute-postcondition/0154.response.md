The code snippet provided appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'`**.
