Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, and `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, then `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Bob' based on the conditions: if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, then `answers` is `['Draw']` if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, `answers` is `['Bob']`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]`, then `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Bob' based on the conditions: if `clues[3] > clues[5]`, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, `answers` contains the string 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'. If `clues[3] <= clues[5]`, then `answers` remains an empty list.**
