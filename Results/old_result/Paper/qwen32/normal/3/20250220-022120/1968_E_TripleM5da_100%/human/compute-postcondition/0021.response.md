To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    print(i, i)
```

This loop starts with `i` equal to 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n` (inclusive).

From the provided output states, we can infer:
- The loop executes at least 3 times if `n` is at least 4.
- After each iteration, the value of `i` is updated to the next integer in the range.

Let's break it down:
- Initially, `i` is 0.
- The first iteration starts with `i` = 3, and it prints `3 3`.
- The second iteration has `i` = 4, and it prints `4 4`.
- The third iteration has `i` = 5, and it prints `5 5`.

This pattern continues until `i` reaches `n`.

Therefore, after the loop has finished executing all iterations:
- `i` will be equal to `n` (the last value of `i` in the range).
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, n is the integer value provided by the user input, i is n.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing all iterations, `t` remains unchanged within its initial range, `n` remains the user-provided integer, and `i` will be equal to `n`, the last value it took in the loop.
