Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by outputting a series of points for each test case. However, the strategy used in the program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let's analyze the program's output for different values of \(n\) and compare it with the examples provided in the problem statement.

1. For \(n = 2\):
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2)
   - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

2. For \(n = 3\):
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
   - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 4\}\), which is not optimal. The optimal set should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) as shown in the example.

3. For \(n = 4\):
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
   - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 4, 6\}\), which is not optimal.

4. For \(n = 5\):
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
   - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 4, 6, 8\}\), which is not optimal.

5. For \(n = 6\):
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
   - The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\), which is not optimal.

The examples provided in the problem statement show that the optimal strategy involves placing points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the optimal arrangement is (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), which results in the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Since the program does not follow a strategy that guarantees the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\), it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
