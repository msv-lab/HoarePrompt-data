The given code snippet is:

```python
print(1, 2)
```

This print statement directly outputs the values 1 and 2, separated by a space. The initial state provided does not affect the values being printed because the print statement is not dependent on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state. The values 1 and 2 are explicitly provided in the print statement itself.

Output: **1 2**
