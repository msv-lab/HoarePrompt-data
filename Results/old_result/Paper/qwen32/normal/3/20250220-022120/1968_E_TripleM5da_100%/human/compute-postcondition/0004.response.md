To determine the state that ensures the `for` loop will execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range `3, n + 1`.

Here's the given information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `range(3, n + 1)` must contain at least one value. This means that `n + 1` must be greater than 3, or equivalently, `n` must be at least 3.

Given that `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 1000 inclusive (`2 <= n <= 10^3`), we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute. 

The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 3. The variable `t` is not relevant to the loop's execution based on the given loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3**
