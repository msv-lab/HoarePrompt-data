To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n` (inclusive). Each iteration prints the value of `i` twice.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration, `i` becomes 3.
- After 2 iterations, `i` becomes 4.
- After 3 iterations, `i` becomes 5.

This pattern suggests that after `k` iterations, `i` will be `k + 2`.

Therefore, after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i = 3` to `i = n`), `i` will be `n`.

The final state of `i` after the loop is `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will print the numbers from 3 to `n` inclusive, each number printed twice. After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `t` will remain the same as it was initially.
