Reasoning:  
The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze why this is the case:

1. **Initial Outputs**: The program starts by outputting the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for every test case. This is fine as it covers some basic distances.
   
2. **Subsequent Outputs**: The program then outputs points (i, i) for all integers \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This means the points will be (3, 3), (4, 4), ..., (n, n).
   
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is 1.
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (i, i) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(2(i-1)\).
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (i, i) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(2(i-1) - 1\).
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points (i, i) and (j, j) for \(i \neq j\) is \(2|j-i|\).

   While this does generate some distinct Manhattan distances, it does not cover all possible distances from 0 to \(2(n-1)\). For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). The set of distinct Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 4}, which is not optimal. The optimal set of points for \(n = 3\) should be (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which gives the set of distinct Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), a better strategy would be to place points in a way that covers a wider range of Manhattan distances. One such strategy could be to use a pattern that spreads out the points more evenly across the grid, such as placing points along the diagonals and edges of the grid in a specific manner.

Given these points, the program does not guarantee that the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
