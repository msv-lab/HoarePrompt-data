Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`; `ops` is an empty list; `p1` contains the initial integers plus all `v1` values from `ops` (which is now empty), with duplicates if `v1 != v2`; `p2` contains any `v1` values that were transferred from `p1` because `p1[-1] == v2`.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` where `n > 2`. `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(n - 4)`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` additionally excludes `v3` (which is the first value returned by `q(0)`), and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v2`; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 3)`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also excludes `v3` where `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v2`, and potentially `v3` if `v2` was not greater than 0; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` is `v1_new` and `v2` is `v2_new`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1_new, v2_new)` and `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also excludes `v3`, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)`, `(v1_new, 0)`, and `(v1, 0)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
