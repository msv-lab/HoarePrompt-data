The code snippet `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the set `vx`. Given that `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` and `v1` is one of the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, `vx` will no longer contain `v1` after the removal.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`**.
