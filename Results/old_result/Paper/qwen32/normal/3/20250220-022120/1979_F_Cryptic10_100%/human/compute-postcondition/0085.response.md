Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1`, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`**

Explanation: The value of `v3` is updated to the value returned by the function `q(0)`. The other variables (`vx`, `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2`) retain their initial states as specified.
