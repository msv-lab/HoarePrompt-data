To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `len(vx) > 2`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as the length of the set `vx` is greater than 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, and potentially excluding `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.

### Steps to Ensure Loop Continues:
1. **Ensure `len(vx) > 2`:** This is the primary condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again.

### Current State:
- `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`.
- If `v2` is greater than 0, no additional elements are removed from `vx`.
- If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` additionally excludes `v3`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `vx` must have more than 2 elements.
- Since `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, it must have at least 3 elements (i.e., `n - 1 >= 3` or `n >= 4`).
- If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` excludes `v3` as well, so `n - 2 >= 3` or `n >= 5` is required.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `vx` must have more than 2 elements. Given the conditions, we can adjust `n` to be at least 5 to guarantee that `vx` will have more than 2 elements after the removal of `v1` and potentially `v3`.

### Final State:
State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `n` must be at least 5**
