Postcondition: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1` and optionally `v3` (if `v2` is not greater than 0). `v1` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v2` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, and `n` must be at least 5. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.**
