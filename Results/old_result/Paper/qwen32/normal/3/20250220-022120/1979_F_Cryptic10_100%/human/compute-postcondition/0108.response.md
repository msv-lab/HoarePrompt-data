To determine the output state, we need to understand the given code snippet and how it modifies the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `p1` is a list.
- `p2` is a list.
- `v1` is a value that can be appended to a list.
- `v2` is a value that is compared with the last element of `p1`.

The code snippet:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```
This line checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is, `v1` is appended to `p2`. If it is not, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Let's break this down:
- If `p1[-1] == v2` is `True`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- If `p1[-1] == v2` is `False`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Given that we do not have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2`, we can describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **If `p1[-1] == v2` is `True`, then `p2` is the original `p2` with `v1` appended. If `p1[-1] == v2` is `False`, then `p1` is the original `p1` with `v1` appended.**

In natural language:
- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is added to the end of `p2`.
- If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, then `v1` is added to the end of `p1`.
