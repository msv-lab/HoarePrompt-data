The code snippet appends two tuples to the `ops` list. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`. The values of `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain unchanged. The `ops` list, which was initially empty, now contains the two new tuples.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1` and `v3`; `ops` is a list containing `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 2)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`**.
