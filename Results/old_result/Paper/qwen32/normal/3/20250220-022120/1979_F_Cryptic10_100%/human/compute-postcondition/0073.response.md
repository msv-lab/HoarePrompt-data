The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1` and `v2`, and the iterable `ops[::-1]`. Since the loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order, we need to adjust `v1` and `v2` to the next pair of values from `ops` in the reverse sequence.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is described based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2` or `p1[-1] != v2`, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration by considering the next pair `(v1, v2)` from `ops`.

Let's denote the current pair as `(v1_current, v2_current)`. The next pair `(v1_next, v2_next)` will be the pair that comes before `(v1_current, v2_current)` in the list `ops`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `p1[-1] == v2_current`, then `p1` contains the same elements as `vx` and `p2` is `[v1_current, v1_current]`.
- If `p1[-1] != v2_current`, then `p1` contains `vx + [v1_current, v1_current]` and `p2` is an empty list.

For the next iteration, we need to consider the next pair `(v1_next, v2_next)` from `ops[::-1]`.

State: **`v1` is `v1_next`, `v2` is `v2_next`, `p1` and `p2` are not adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.**

To be more specific, let's assume the current pair was `(v1_current, v2_current)`. The next pair `(v1_next, v2_next)` would be the pair that was processed before `(v1_current, v2_current)` in the original `ops` list.

State: **`v1` is `v1_next`, `v2` is `v2_next`**.
