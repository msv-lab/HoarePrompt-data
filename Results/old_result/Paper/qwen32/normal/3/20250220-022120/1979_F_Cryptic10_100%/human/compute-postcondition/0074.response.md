The given code snippet checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Given:
- `v1` is `v1_next`
- `v2` is `v2_next`

The impact of the code is that either `p1` or `p2` will have `v1` appended to it, depending on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.

If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`. Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `p1` and `p2`, we can only describe the change in terms of the condition:

Output State: **`v1` is `v1_next`, `v2` is `v2_next`, if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` has `v1_next` appended; otherwise, `p1` has `v1_next` appended.**
