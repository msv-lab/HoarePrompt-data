The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple containing `v1` and `v2` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now include the new tuple `(v1, v2)` as its last element. The values of `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `n` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1`, `v3` (if `v2` is not greater than 0), `v1` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v2` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `n` must be at least 5, and `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` as its last element.**
