The given code snippet modifies one of the pairs in the list `ops` based on a condition. Specifically, it checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If true, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`. 

Given that `v1` and `v2` are defined as the first and second elements of the second-to-last pair in `ops`, respectively, we need to consider how the list `ops` is affected by this operation.

Let's assume `ops` has at least two pairs, and let's denote these pairs as `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn-1`, `pn`, where `pn-1` is the second-to-last pair and `pn` is the last pair. Therefore, `v1` is the first element of `pn-1` and `v2` is the second element of `pn-1`.

The code snippet will then check if the last element of `p1` (which is some element of the first pair in `ops`) is equal to `v2`. Depending on this condition, it will append `v1` to either `p2` or `p1`.

Since the exact structure of `ops` is not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of the changes made to `ops` based on the condition.

Output State: **`ops` is modified such that if the last element of the first pair (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to the second pair (`p2`). Otherwise, `v1` is appended to the first pair (`p1`).**
