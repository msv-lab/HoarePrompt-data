Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3`; `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(n - 4)` where `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**

In simple terms: The set `vx` originally contained integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`. After executing the code, `v3` (which is the first value returned by `q(0)`) has been removed from `vx`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain unchanged.
