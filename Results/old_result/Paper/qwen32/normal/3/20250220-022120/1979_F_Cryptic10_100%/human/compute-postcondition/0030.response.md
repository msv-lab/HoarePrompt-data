The code snippet converts the set `vx` into a list and assigns it to `p1`, while initializing `p2` as an empty list. The set `vx` contains exactly 2 integers, and `ops` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers; `p1` is a list containing the same 2 integers as `vx`; `p2` is an empty list; `ops` is a list containing tuples that document the operations performed during the loop.**
