The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. This means that `ops` will now include this new tuple as its last element.

Given the initial state, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1` and `v2` (if `v2` was originally in the set and not equal to `v1`). If `v2 <= 0`, `v1` and `v3` must be distinct. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 3)`.

The only change in the state is the addition of the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The set `vx` and the values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `v3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1` and `v2` (if `v2` was originally in the set and not equal to `v1`); if `v2 <= 0`, `v1` and `v3` must be distinct; `v1`, `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 3)`. `ops` includes the new tuple `(v1, v2)`**.
