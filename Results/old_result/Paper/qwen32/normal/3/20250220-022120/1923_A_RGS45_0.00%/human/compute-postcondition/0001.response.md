The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized before the loop, we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1**
