Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips. The logic used in the program is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the number of operations required.

The current program uses the following incorrect logic:
1. It finds the first occurrence of a chip (`1`) from the left (`x`).
2. It finds the first occurrence of a chip (`1`) from the right (`y`).
3. It then slices the array from `x` to `n - y` and counts the number of free cells (`0`) in this slice.

This approach does not correctly account for the minimum operations needed to move all chips into a contiguous block. Instead, a more accurate approach would involve iterating through the array and calculating the number of operations required to move each chip to the leftmost possible position, considering the positions of all chips.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input('').split()))
        # Find the leftmost and rightmost positions of chips
        leftmost = arr.index(1)
        rightmost = n - 1 - arr[::-1].index(1)
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        current_position = leftmost
        for i in range(leftmost, rightmost + 1):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                operations += i - current_position
                current_position += 1
        print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of operations by iterating through the positions of the chips and summing the distances each chip needs to move to form a contiguous block starting from the leftmost chip.
