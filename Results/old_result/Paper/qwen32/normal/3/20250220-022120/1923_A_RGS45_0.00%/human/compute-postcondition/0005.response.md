The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. If '1' is found, `y` will hold the index of that occurrence in the reversed string. If '1' is not found, `y` will be -1.

Given the initial state, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found. The value of `y` can be related to `x` as follows: if `x` is not -1, then `y` is the index of '1' from the end of the string `arr`. Specifically, `y` will be `len(arr) - 1 - x` if `x` is not -1. If `x` is -1, then `y` will also be -1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is an input string; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**
