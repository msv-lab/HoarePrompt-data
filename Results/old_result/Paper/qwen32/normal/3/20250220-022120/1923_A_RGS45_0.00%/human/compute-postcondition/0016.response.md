The code assigns the value of the next integer input to the variable `n`. The value of `t` is unchanged and still represents the number of test cases, which is equal to the previous `t` minus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `n` is an input integer.**
