The code snippet `z = arr[x:n - y]` updates the value of `z` to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.

Given that:
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `arr` is a string.

The value of `z` is now defined as the substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is the new input string; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
