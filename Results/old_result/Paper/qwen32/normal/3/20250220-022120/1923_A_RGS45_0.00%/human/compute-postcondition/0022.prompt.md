Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = str(input(''))
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is an input string; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is the new input string; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a string input by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
