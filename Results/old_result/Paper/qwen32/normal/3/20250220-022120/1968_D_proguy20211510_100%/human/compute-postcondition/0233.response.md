The code snippet provided updates the value of `ps` by setting it to `p[ps - 1]`. This means that `ps` now holds the value of the element in the list `p` at the index `ps - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Since `ps` was initially `p[ps - 1]`, after executing the code, `ps` will be updated to the value of `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, and `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`.**
