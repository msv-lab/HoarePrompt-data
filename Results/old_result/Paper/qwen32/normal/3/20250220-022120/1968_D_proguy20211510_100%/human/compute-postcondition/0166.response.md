Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is 0, `paths` must have at least one element, and `k` is less than `i + 1`. The loop or conditional block is exited.**

Explanation: The values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `paths`, and the condition `k < i + 1` remain unchanged. The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or conditional block, but does not affect the values of the variables.
