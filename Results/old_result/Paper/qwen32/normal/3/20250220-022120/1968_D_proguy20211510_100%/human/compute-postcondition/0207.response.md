Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body that is triggered under certain conditions. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if there are any such conditions that would break out of the loop. Therefore, for the purpose of this task, we assume that the loop will execute one more time unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Since the loop condition is `True`, no variables need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed. The state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as is.

State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
