Output State: **`resb` is `max(0, preb + pathb[i] * (k - i))`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, `curr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
