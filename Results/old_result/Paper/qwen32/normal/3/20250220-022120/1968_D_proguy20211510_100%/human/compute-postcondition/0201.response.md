For the given task, the `while` loop is `while True:`, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once regardless of the state of any variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1**
