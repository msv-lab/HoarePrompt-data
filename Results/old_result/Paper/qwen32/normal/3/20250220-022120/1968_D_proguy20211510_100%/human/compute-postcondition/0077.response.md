Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is sum(pathb), `resb` is max(curr for all iterations), `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is max(ress, curr), `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
