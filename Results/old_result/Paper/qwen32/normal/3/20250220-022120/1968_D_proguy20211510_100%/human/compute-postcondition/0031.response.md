Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`; `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection; `paths` now includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end.**

In natural language: The list `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial states.
