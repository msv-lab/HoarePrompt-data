The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input.**
