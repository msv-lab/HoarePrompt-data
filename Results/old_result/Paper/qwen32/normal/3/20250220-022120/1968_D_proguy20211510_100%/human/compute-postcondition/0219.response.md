The code snippet sets the value of `vis[ps - 1]` to 1. This means the element at index `ps - 1` in the list `vis` is now 1, while all other elements in `vis` remain unchanged as 0. All other variables (`resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`) retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is an empty list.**
