The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible score for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their paths and the values in list `a`. It then prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.
