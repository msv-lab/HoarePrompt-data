Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 0; `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the current point; `pb` is the current value; `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
