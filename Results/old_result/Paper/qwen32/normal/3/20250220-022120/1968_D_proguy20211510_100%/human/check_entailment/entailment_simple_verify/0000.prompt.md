You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The final output state is determined by the last test case processed. Specifically, `resb` and `ress` will hold the maximum scores for `pathb` and `paths` respectively, and the program will print "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison of `resb` and `ress`. All other variables (`vis`, `pathb`, `paths`, `pb`, `ps`, `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`) will reflect the state of the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program contains a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the situation where the player can stay in the same position or move to `p_x` on each turn. The program assumes that the player will always move to the next position in the cycle and does not account for the possibility of staying in the same position to maximize the score.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program correctly detects cycles for both Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` until a repeated position is found.
   - However, the program does not account for the possibility of staying in the same position to maximize the score.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the score for each player by summing up the values of `a` for the positions they visit.
   - The program considers the possibility of staying in the same position only implicitly by the condition `if k < i + 1: break`, which stops the summation if the number of turns `k` is less than the number of positions visited so far.
   - However, the program does not explicitly calculate the optimal score considering the possibility of staying in the same position to maximize the score.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy for each player is to maximize their score by either staying in the same position or moving to the next position in the cycle.
   - The program does not correctly handle this strategy, especially when the number of turns `k` is large and the cycle length is small. In such cases, the player might stay in the same position to maximize the score.

**Example Case:**

Consider the following test case:

```
1
4 5 1 1
2 3 4 1
1 100 1 1
```

- **Bodya's Path:** Starts at position 1, moves to position 2, then to position 3, then to position 4, and finally back to position 1.
- **Sasha's Path:** Same as Bodya's path.
- **Scores Calculation:**
  - Bodya's score: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 = 104` (staying at position 1 on the 5th turn).
  - Sasha's score: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 = 104` (staying at position 1 on the 5th turn).

The correct output should be "Draw", but the program might not correctly handle the case where the player can stay in the same position to maximize the score.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by staying in the same position.
