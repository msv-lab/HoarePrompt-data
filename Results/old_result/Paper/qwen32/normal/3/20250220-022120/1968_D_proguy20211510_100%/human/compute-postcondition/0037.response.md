Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 0; `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the current point; `pb` is the current value; `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. After executing `paths.append(a[ps - 1])`, `paths` now includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` at the end.**

In simple terms, the list `paths` now has one more element added to it, which is `a[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their described states.
