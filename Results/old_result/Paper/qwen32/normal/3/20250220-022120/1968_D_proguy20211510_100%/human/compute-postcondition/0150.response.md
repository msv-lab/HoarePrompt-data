Output State: **`resb` is `max(0, preb + pathb[i] * (k - i))`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**

In this output state, the value of `resb` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (which was 0) and the value of `curr`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
