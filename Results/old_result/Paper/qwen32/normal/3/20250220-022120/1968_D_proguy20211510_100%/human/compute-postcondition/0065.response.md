Output State: **`pathb` contains at least two elements, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In natural language: The value of `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are still in effect.
