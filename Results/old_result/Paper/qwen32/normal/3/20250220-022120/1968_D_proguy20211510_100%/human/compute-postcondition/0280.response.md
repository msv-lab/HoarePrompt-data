The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Bodya')
```

This statement will print the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the initial state provided. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, or `paths`.

Output: **Bodya**
