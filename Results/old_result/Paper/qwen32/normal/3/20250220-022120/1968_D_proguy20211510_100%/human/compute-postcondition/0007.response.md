The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
