Postcondition: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is 0, `paths` must have at least one element, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, the loop or conditional block is exited. Otherwise, no change occurs regarding `k`.**
