Postcondition: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `preb`, `resb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` (before the final update), and `pres` (before the final update) remain unchanged. Additionally, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress` and `ress` is greater than `resb`.**
