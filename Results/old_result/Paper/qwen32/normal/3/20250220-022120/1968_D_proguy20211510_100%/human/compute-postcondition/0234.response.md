Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, and `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`. The loop has been terminated.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop is terminated.
