The code snippet `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates the value of `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
