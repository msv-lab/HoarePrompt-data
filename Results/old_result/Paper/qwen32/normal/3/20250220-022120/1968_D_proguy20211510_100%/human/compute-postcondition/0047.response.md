The provided code snippet initializes two variables, `resb` and `ress`, to 0. None of the other variables (`pathb`, `pb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ps`) are affected by this initialization.

Output State: **`pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the point of cycle detection, `pb` is the value that causes the cycle detection, `paths` includes all elements from the start until the cycle is detected, `vis` has `vis[ps - 1]` set to 1 at the point of cycle detection, and `ps` is the value that caused the cycle detection; `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0.**
