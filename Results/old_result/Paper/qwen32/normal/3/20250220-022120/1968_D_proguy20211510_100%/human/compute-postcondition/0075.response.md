The code updates the variable `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and the value of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is sum(pathb), `resb` is max(curr for all iterations), `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is max(ress, curr), `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`**.
