The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string 'Bodya'.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides information about variables `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, and `i_final`, and describes their relationships and values.
- However, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables. It directly outputs the string 'Bodya'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Bodya**
