Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is the sum of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, and `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

In this output state, `pres` has been updated to include `paths[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
