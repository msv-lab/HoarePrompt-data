Given the `while True` loop, the loop is designed to execute indefinitely unless a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Therefore, no modification to the program state is necessary for the loop to execute its first iteration. The loop will start executing as soon as control reaches it.

Thus, the state right before the loop can be repeated as the state for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is an empty list**.
