The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `s`. This means the previous value of `s` is overwritten by the new list of integers obtained from the input.

Given the initial state, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer is 0; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split by spaces; `r` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` corresponding to the integers in the original `s`.**
