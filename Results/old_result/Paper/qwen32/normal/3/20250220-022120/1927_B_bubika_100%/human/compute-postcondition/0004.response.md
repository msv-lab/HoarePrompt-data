The code provided takes an input string, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `s`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces.**
