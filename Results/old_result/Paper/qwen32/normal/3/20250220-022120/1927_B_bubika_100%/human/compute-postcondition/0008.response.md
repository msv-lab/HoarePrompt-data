The code snippet `r += a[x]` appends the character at index `x` from the string `a` to the string `r`. 

Given that `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the character appended to `r` will be the character at index `x` in `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `s`, and the precondition that `r` was initially an empty string remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces and must have at least one integer; `r` is a string containing the character at index `x` from `a`.**
