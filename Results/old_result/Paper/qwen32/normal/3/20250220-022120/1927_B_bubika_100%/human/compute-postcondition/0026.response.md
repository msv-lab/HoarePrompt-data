The code snippet provided is `x = b.index(i)`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. This will result in a `NameError` because the code is trying to find the index of an undefined variable `i` in the list `b`. Given the task constraints, I'll assume that `i` is supposed to be a character from the string `a` (since `a` contains all the lowercase letters of the alphabet).

Let's assume `i` is a character from `a` (for example, `i = 'a'`). Given that `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer is 0, the `index` method will not be able to find the character `i` in the list `b` because `b` contains integers, not characters. This would result in a `ValueError`.

However, if we assume that `i` is an integer (which is not the case given the context, but for the sake of this task, let's assume `i` is an integer that could be an index in `b`), the value of `x` would be the index of `i` in the list `b`. Since all elements in `b` are 0, `b.index(i)` would return the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.

Given the initial state and the assumptions:
- If `i` is assumed to be an integer and `i` is 0, then `x` would be 0 because `b.index(0)` would return 0 (the index of the first occurrence of 0 in `b`).

Since the original task does not specify what `i` is, and assuming `i` is 0 for the sake of providing an output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer is 0; `s` is a list of integers with at least one element; `r` is an empty string; `x` is 0**
