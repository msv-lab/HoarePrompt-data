The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, `m`, `i`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **Alice**
