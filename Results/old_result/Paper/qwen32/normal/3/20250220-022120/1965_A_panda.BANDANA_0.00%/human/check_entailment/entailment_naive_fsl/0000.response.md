Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks if there is a pile with exactly 1 stone and makes a decision based on that, which is not sufficient to determine the winner under optimal play.

The correct strategy for determining the winner is based on the concept of the Nim Game, specifically the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of all pile sizes is zero at the start, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the Nim-sum helps determine if the current position is a winning or losing position for the player about to move.

Here's a counterexample where the provided program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Bob
```

Explanation for the counterexample:
- The Nim-sum of the piles (2 ^ 2 ^ 2) is 0.
- Since the Nim-sum is 0, the first player (Alice) is in a losing position if both players play optimally.
- The provided program would incorrectly print "Alice" because there is no pile with exactly 1 stone.

Thus, the program is not correct for all cases, and the Correctness is False.
