Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not yet initialized.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `l` contains the integer 1, then `e` includes 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; If the new `l` contains the integer 1, then `e` includes 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the new list `l`; `i` is `t-1`. The condition `1 in l` determines whether the integer 1 is included in the set `e` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; If the new `l` contains the integer 1, then `e` includes 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the new list `l`; `i` is `t-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
