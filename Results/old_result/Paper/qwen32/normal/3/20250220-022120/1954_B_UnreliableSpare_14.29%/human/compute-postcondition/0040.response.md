Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the properties of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
