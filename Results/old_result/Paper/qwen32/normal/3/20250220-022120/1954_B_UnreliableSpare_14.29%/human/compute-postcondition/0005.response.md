The value of `flag` is changed to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is False; `i` is 1; `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.**
