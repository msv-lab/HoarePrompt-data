Reasoning:  
The program provided is attempting to solve the problem as described, but there are some issues with its logic. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it correctly prints `-1` since the array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.

2. However, when the array is not uniform, the program tries to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. The minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful might not necessarily be related to consecutive elements equal to the first element.

3. The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful should involve checking various possible removals that would disrupt the ability to make all elements the same using the specified operation.

Given the above points, the current logic does not guarantee the correct solution for all possible test cases. Therefore, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
