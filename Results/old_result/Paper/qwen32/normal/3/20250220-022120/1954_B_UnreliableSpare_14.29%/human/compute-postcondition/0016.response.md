To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. The loop checks if the current element `arr[i]` is different from the previous element `arr[i-1]`. If they are different, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. If they are the same, `flag` remains `True` and the loop continues.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is 1.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is 2.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is 3.

This implies that the loop has not broken out of its execution in the first 3 iterations, meaning `arr[1] == arr[0]`, `arr[2] == arr[1]`, and `arr[3] == arr[2]`. The loop will continue until either `i` reaches `n-1` or `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i-1]`.

If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will reach `n-1` and `flag` will remain `True` because all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` are the same.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:
- `t` remains the same integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` remains the same integer.
- `a` remains the same list of `n` integers.
- `arr` remains the same list of integers derived from the input.
- `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, it is `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.

The loop will have completed all iterations if `flag` is still `True` after the last iteration.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is the integer input value; a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; arr is a list of integers derived from the input; flag is True if all elements in arr are the same; otherwise, flag is False.**
