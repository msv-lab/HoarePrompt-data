Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'); `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 1; `arr[i]` is equal to `val`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
