The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given that `ans` is initially `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `0`, `ans` will be updated to `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False; `ans` is 0; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**
