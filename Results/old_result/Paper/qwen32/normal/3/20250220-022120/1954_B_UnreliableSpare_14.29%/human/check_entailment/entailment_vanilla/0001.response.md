Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

### Solution Analysis

The solution provided consists of two main parts:
1. **Check if the array is uniform (all elements are the same)**:
   ```python
   flag = True
   for i in range(1, n):
       if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
           flag = False
           break
   ```
   This part correctly identifies if the array is already uniform, in which case it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the answer should be `-1`.

2. **Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove**:
   ```python
   ans = Decimal('Infinity')
   (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
   for i in range(n):
       if arr[i] == val:
           cnt += 1
       else:
           ans = min(ans, cnt)
   ans = min(ans, cnt)
   ```
   This part attempts to find the minimum segment of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beautiful property of the array. However, there are a few issues with this approach:
   - The logic only considers the first sequence of consecutive elements and does not account for other potential segments that might be shorter.
   - It does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of different elements.

### Correctness Evaluation

The current solution does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It fails to consider multiple segments and their lengths properly. For example, in the fourth test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The correct answer is `3` because removing the first three elements (or the last three elements) results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 3, 5]`, respectively, which are not beautiful. However, the provided solution might not correctly identify this.

### Conclusion

The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
