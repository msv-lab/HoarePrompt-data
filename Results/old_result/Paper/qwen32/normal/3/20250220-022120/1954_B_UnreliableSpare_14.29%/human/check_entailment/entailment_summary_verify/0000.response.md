Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if, for any index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1\)), if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\), then \(a_i\) can be replaced with \(a_{i-1}\) (or \(a_{i+1}\)) to keep the array beautiful.

### Program Analysis

The provided code performs the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
3. It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a `flag` variable.
4. If the array is uniform (all elements are the same), it prints `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array and prints this value as the answer.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary correctly states that `func_1` checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if so, prints `-1`. It also states that if the array is not uniform, it finds and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in the array that are equal to the first element of the array.

### Original Assessment Analysis

The original assessment claims that the code is incorrect due to several issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of the Flag Variable**: The `flag` variable is correctly set to `False` if any pair of consecutive elements are different.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**: The calculation of `ans` is flawed because it does not consider the best way to break the "beautiful" property by removing elements from the middle, start, or end of the array.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle arrays where the "beautiful" property is maintained by multiple segments of identical elements separated by different elements.
4. **Potential Infinite Loop**: Using `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary but not the primary issue.

### Detailed Reasoning

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The code will output `3`, which is correct in this case because removing the first three `3`s or the last three `3`s will break the "beautiful" property.

However, the code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The code will output `1`, but the correct answer is `1` (removing any single `2` will make the array stop being beautiful). This example is correctly handled by the code.

### Correctness Evaluation

The code fails to handle some edge cases, such as:
- Arrays with multiple segments of identical elements separated by different elements.
- Arrays where removing elements from the middle, start, or end is necessary to break the "beautiful" property.

The corrected approach suggested in the original assessment is more robust and correctly handles these cases.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases.

**Final: **False**
