Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Here is a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Flag Variable**:
   - The `flag` variable is used to check if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, the array is already beautiful, and removing any element will not make it stop being beautiful, so the function should return `-1`.
   - However, the `flag` variable is set to `False` as soon as it finds a pair of consecutive elements that are different, which is correct. But the calculation of `ans` is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The `ans` variable is intended to store the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
   - The code calculates `ans` as the minimum count of any segment of identical elements, but it does not correctly account for the fact that removing elements from the middle of the array might be necessary to break the "beautiful" property.
   - The code does not consider the possibility that removing elements from the start or end of the array might be necessary to break the "beautiful" property.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle arrays where the "beautiful" property is maintained by multiple segments of identical elements separated by different elements. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`. The current code might incorrectly calculate `ans` as `1` (the length of the segment `[1]`), but the correct answer is `2` (removing the elements `2` and `3`).

4. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - Although not directly related to correctness, the use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple `float('inf')` or a large integer. However, this is not the primary issue causing the code to be incorrect.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The code will output `3`, but the correct answer is `3` (removing the first three `3`s or the last three `3`s), which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed and will fail for other cases.

### A Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property. This involves checking segments of identical elements and determining the best way to break the pattern by removing elements.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(arr)) == 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            min_removal = n
            for i in range(1, n):
                if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
                    min_removal = min(min_removal, i, n - i)
            print(min_removal)
```

This corrected code checks if all elements are the same and returns `-1` if true. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of elements to remove by considering the first and last segments of identical elements.
