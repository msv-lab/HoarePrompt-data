You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to the first element of `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Here is a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Flag Variable**:
   - The `flag` variable is used to check if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, the array is already beautiful, and removing any element will not make it stop being beautiful, so the function should return `-1`.
   - However, the `flag` variable is set to `False` as soon as it finds a pair of consecutive elements that are different, which is correct. But the calculation of `ans` is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The `ans` variable is intended to store the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
   - The code calculates `ans` as the minimum count of any segment of identical elements, but it does not correctly account for the fact that removing elements from the middle of the array might be necessary to break the "beautiful" property.
   - The code does not consider the possibility that removing elements from the start or end of the array might be necessary to break the "beautiful" property.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle arrays where the "beautiful" property is maintained by multiple segments of identical elements separated by different elements. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`. The current code might incorrectly calculate `ans` as `1` (the length of the segment `[1]`), but the correct answer is `2` (removing the elements `2` and `3`).

4. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - Although not directly related to correctness, the use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple `float('inf')` or a large integer. However, this is not the primary issue causing the code to be incorrect.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The code will output `3`, but the correct answer is `3` (removing the first three `3`s or the last three `3`s), which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed and will fail for other cases.

### A Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property. This involves checking segments of identical elements and determining the best way to break the pattern by removing elements.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(arr)) == 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            min_removal = n
            for i in range(1, n):
                if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
                    min_removal = min(min_removal, i, n - i)
            print(min_removal)
```

This corrected code checks if all elements are the same and returns `-1` if true. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of elements to remove by considering the first and last segments of identical elements.
