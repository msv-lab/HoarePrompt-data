The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value `-1`. The initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs `-1`.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n.
   - `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `flag` is True indicating all elements in `arr` are the same.
   - `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
   - `val` is `arr[0]`.
   - `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
   - `i` is `n`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
