Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `0`, `n` is an integer input greater than `2`, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is a string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`. If the character at index `k` in `a` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.**
