The task involves understanding the given initial state and determining the output of the `print(k)` statement.

From the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` and `b` are strings input from the user.
- `k` is set to 1.
- `no_path` is a boolean set to True, indicating that at least one character at an even index in `b` is not '>'.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of the variable `k`.

Given that `k` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be the integer 1.

Output: **1**
