Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `k` is `n - 2` if `n` is even or `n - 3` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` is `False`. Additionally, every character at an even index in `b` is `'>'`.**
