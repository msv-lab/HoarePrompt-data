The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n` and `k` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`. Since `k` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user, and the second-to-last character of `b` is `'>'`, `k` is 4. If `b[k]` is not `'>'`, `no_path` is `False`.**
