Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `i` is `0`. `n` is the same integer input, which is greater than or equal to 2. `a` is still the same string input from the user. `b` is still the same string input from the user, with the second-to-last character being `'>'`. `no_path` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
    print(k)
    if a[k] != '>':
        no_path = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `0`, `n` is an integer input greater than `2`, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is a string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`. If the character at index `k` in `a` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `0`, `n` is an integer input greater than `2`, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is a string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`, `k` is the next value in the sequence defined by the range `(1, n-1, 2)`. If `a[k]` is not `'>'`, `no_path` is set to `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `0`, `n` is an integer input greater than `2`, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is a string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`, `k` is the next value in the sequence defined by `range(1, n-1, 2)`. If `a[k]` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
