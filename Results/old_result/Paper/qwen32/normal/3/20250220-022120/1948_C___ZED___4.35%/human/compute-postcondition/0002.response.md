The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `a` will hold the string input from the user. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input from the user**.
