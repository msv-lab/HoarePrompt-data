Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `b` are the new string inputs from the user, `k` is the largest even number less than `n` if `no_path` is `True`, otherwise `k` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If `no_path` is `False`, it indicates that any `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is not equal to `'>'`. If `no_path` is `True`, it indicates that all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and no character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is not equal to `'>'`.**
