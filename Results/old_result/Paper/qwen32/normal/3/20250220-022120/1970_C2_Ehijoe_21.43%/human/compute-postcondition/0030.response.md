To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `moves = func_1(nodes, start)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only infer that it takes the `nodes` dictionary and `start` integer as inputs and returns a value which is assigned to `moves`.

Given the initial state, the variables `nodes`, `leaves`, and `start` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by `func_1`. Since there is no information about the modifications made by `func_1`, we can only assume that `moves` will hold the result returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair; `leaves` is a deque that includes all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their list of connected nodes; `start` is an input integer; `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`**.
