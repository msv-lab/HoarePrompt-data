Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v`; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the `nodes` dictionary; `n` and `t` are integers provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; the loop has executed `n - 1` times, with each iteration adding an edge between two nodes `u` and `v` read from the input; `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair. If the list associated with `key` has exactly one element, then `leaves` includes `key` as one of its elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair. `key` is `key_next`, which is the next key in `nodes` that has not been processed yet. If the list associated with `key` has exactly one element, then `leaves` includes `key_next` as one of its elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair. `key` is the next key in `nodes` after `key_next` that has not been processed yet. If the list associated with `key` has exactly one element, then `leaves` includes `key` as one of its elements. If the list associated with `key` has exactly one element, `leaves` now includes `key` as one of its elements. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
