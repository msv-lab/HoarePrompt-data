The code snippet `leaves.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `leaves`. This means that the list `leaves` will now include `key` as one of its elements. The values of `nodes` and `key_next` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `key` having a list with exactly one element in `nodes` is still valid if it was true before the operation.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair. `key` is the next key in `nodes` after `key_next` that has not been processed yet. If the list associated with `key` has exactly one element, then `leaves` includes `key` as one of its elements. `leaves` now includes `key` as one of its elements.**
