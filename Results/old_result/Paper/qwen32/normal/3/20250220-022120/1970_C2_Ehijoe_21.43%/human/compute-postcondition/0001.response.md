The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `edges`. None of the other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`) are affected by this code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `edges` list which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the nodes dictionary; `n` and `t` are integers provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list.**
