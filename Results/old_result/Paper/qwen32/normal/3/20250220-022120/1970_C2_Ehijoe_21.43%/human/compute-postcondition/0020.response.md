The code snippet appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. This means that the `leaves` list will now include the `key` as one of its elements. The state of `nodes` remains unchanged as the code does not modify the `nodes` dictionary. The precondition that `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair, and the current value of the list associated with `key` has exactly one element, still holds true.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key `u` has a list of connected nodes `v` and must have at least one key-value pair. The current value of the list associated with `key` has exactly one element. `leaves` includes the `key` as one of its elements.**
