Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

Since the function `func_3` only reads the number of test cases and then iterates over them calling `func_2` for each, the only variable in its signature that we can describe is `t`. The variables `x` and `y` are used within `func_2` (which is not provided here), but they are not part of `func_3`'s signature.
