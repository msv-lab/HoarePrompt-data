Let's analyze the provided initial state and the code to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers.
- The constraints on `x` and `y` are: \( 0 \leq x \leq 99 \) and \( 0 \leq y \leq 99 \).
- It is explicitly stated that it is **not the case** that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
- Additionally, it is explicitly stated that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Constraints on `x` and `y`:**
   - From the conditions, we know that `y` is 0.
   - Since `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, `x` can be any integer from 1 to 99.

2. **Expression `x / 15`:**
   - The expression `x / 15` will yield a floating-point result.
   - Depending on the value of `x`, the result of `x / 15` can range from approximately `1/15` (when `x` is 1) to `99/15` (when `x` is 99).

3. **Applying `math.ceil`:**
   - The `math.ceil` function will round up the result of `x / 15` to the nearest integer.
   - Let's determine the range of possible values:
     - When `x` is 1, `x / 15` is approximately `0.0667`, and `math.ceil(0.0667)` is `1`.
     - When `x` is 15, `x / 15` is `1.0`, and `math.ceil(1.0)` is `1`.
     - When `x` is 16, `x / 15` is approximately `1.0667`, and `math.ceil(1.0667)` is `2`.
     - When `x` is 30, `x / 15` is `2.0`, and `math.ceil(2.0)` is `2`.
     - When `x` is 31, `x / 15` is approximately `2.0667`, and `math.ceil(2.0667)` is `3`.
     - This pattern continues up to `x = 99`, where `x / 15` is approximately `6.6`, and `math.ceil(6.6)` is `7`.

### Conclusion:
The value printed by `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` will be an integer ranging from 1 to 7, depending on the specific value of `x`.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), depending on the value of `x`**
