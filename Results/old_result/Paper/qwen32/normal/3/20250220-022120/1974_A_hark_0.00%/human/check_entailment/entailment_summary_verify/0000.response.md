### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step to ensure accuracy.

#### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. This function is not used in the rest of the program.
2. `func_2()`: Handles the logic for a single test case.
3. `func_3()`: Loops through all test cases and calls `func_2()` for each.

The core logic is in `func_2()`:
```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Calculation for `x` after placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is indeed incorrect. It incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` and then adds `y * 4`. This does not correctly account for the number of 1x1 cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, the correct adjustment should be `x = x - bxsfory * 4`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for `bxsfory1`:**
   - The line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` incorrectly adds `1` to the result of `math.ceil(x / 15)`. This seems to be an attempt to account for the possibility of needing an extra screen, but it's not correctly implemented.
   - The correct adjustment should be `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Corrected Logic for `func_2()`

Here is the corrected version of `func_2()`:
```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 4  # Correctly subtract the cells occupied by 2x2 icons
        bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)  # Correctly calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Re-evaluation

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the provided program and provides a corrected version of `func_2()`. The original program does not handle the calculations correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
