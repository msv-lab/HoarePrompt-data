It seems there is a discrepancy between the provided function definition and the parameter constraints. The function `func_3()` is defined without any parameters, but the constraints describe a parameter `t`. Assuming the function should accept `t` as a parameter, here is the functionality description:

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The function returns a value based on the value of `t`, but since the specific return values or conditions are not provided, the exact return functionality is unclear.**
