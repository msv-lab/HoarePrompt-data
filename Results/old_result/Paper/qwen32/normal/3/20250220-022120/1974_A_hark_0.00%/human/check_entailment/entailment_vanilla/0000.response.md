Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens.
   - A 5x3 screen has 15 cells.
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It seems redundant.
   - `func_2` handles the logic for a single test case.
   - `func_3` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case.

3. **Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens is flawed.
   - The program tries to account for the 2x2 icons first, then the 1x1 icons, but the calculations are incorrect.
   - Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect.
       - `bxsfory * 15` suggests that each 2x2 icon occupies 15 cells, which is incorrect (each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).
       - The term `y * 4` is also incorrectly added to `x`.
   - The line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect:
       - It incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons by adding 1 extra screen.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Place as many 2x2 icons as possible.
   - Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - Place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.
   - Calculate the total number of screens required.

### Correctness of the Program:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. The logic for handling the placement of icons is flawed.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be corrected to properly account for the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the screens.
