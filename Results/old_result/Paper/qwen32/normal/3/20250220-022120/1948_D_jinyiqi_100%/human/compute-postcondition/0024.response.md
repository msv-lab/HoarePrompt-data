Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where `2 <= n <= 5000`, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j < n`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `count` is adjusted based on the conditions given. Specifically, if `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.**
