The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `j`, `n`, `k`, and the conditions involving `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `count` is not equal to `j` + 1, `k` is 2, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`**.
