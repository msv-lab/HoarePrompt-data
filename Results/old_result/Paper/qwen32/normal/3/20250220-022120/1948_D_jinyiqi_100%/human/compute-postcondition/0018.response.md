To determine what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
- **`s`**: A list of characters with length `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- **`n`**: The length of the list `s`.
- **`j`**: An integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\).
- **`k`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 in a loop (implied by the context).
- **`count`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 if the condition `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` is true. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

### Code Logic:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

To understand the output, we need to know the final value of `count` before this print statement is executed. The value of `count` depends on the conditions inside the loop where `k` is incremented.

### Conditions Inside the Loop:
- If `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

### Analysis:
The value of `count` is determined by the specific characters in the list `s` and the value of `j`. Since the exact list `s` and the value of `j` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `count`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `count`.

### Final Output:
The code prints `count * 2`. Given that `count` is incremented based on the conditions mentioned above, the final output will be twice the value of `count`.

Output: **count * 2 (where count is determined by the conditions in the loop based on the characters in the list `s` and the value of `j`)**
