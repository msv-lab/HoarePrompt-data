The code snippet `n = len(s)` assigns the variable `n` the length of the list `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of characters with a length between 1 and 5000 for each test case. Therefore, `n` will be an integer with the same value as the length of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all lists `s` over all test cases does not exceed 5000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
