Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `n` is the length of `s`, `count` is 1, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < n, and either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.**

The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
