Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Specifically, the code does not replace question marks with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat. Instead, it only checks for existing characters or question marks that could form a tandem repeat without replacing the question marks.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
a?b?a?
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
By replacing the question marks with appropriate characters, we can form a tandem repeat of length 4. For example, replacing the question marks with 'a' results in the string "aabbaa", which contains a tandem repeat "aabb" of length 4.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
0
```

The program incorrectly outputs 0 because it does not attempt to replace the question marks to form a tandem repeat. Instead, it only checks for existing characters or question marks that could form a tandem repeat, which in this case, do not exist without replacements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
