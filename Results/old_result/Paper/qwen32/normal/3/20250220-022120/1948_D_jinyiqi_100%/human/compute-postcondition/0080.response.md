Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the conditions and the return statement.

Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is at least 4
- `k` is 3
- `s[k]` is not equal to '?'
- `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?'
- `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`

Condition:
- The condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is false based on the initial state.

Effect on `count`:
- Since the condition is false, `count` is set to 0.

Return Statement:
- The function returns nothing (`return`).

Output State: **The program returns None**.
