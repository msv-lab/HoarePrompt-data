The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of the variable `count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is 1, and either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.**
