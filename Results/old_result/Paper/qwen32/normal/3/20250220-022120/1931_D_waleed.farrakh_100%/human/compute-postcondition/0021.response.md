To determine the Output State, we need to analyze the given code snippet and understand the impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
results = func_1(test_cases)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with the argument `test_cases` and assigns the result to the variable `results`. The variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `data`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged unless modified inside the function `func_1`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we assume it does not modify any of the external variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `data`, or `idx`.

Thus, the only change in the state is the introduction of the new variable `results`, which holds the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2*t]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), ..., (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 2*t, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`**.
