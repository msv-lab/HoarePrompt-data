Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary with `current_pair` as a key and its value set to 1; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases` and has at least one element; `a` is the third element of `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the value of `freq[current_pair]` to 1. This means that the dictionary `freq` now includes the key `current_pair` with a value of 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
