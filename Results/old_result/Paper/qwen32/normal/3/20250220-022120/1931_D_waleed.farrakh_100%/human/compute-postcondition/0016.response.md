Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[5]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[5]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[5]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 5**

Explanation: The value of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to be the integers parsed from the string `data[5]`. The values of `t`, `arr`, `data`, `test_cases`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
