Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The function processes each test case individually. If the array `arr` contains both `x` and `y`, it returns a specific value or result (which is not detailed here) for that test case. If the array does not contain both `x` and `y`, it returns a different value or result (also not detailed here) for that test case.**
