The code appends a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are simply being added to the list.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[5]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[5]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[5]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[6]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing three tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 5**.
