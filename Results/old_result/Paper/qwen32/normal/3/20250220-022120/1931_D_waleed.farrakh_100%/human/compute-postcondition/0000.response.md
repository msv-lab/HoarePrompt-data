The provided code snippet is simply reading input from the standard input stream and assigning it to the variable `input`. However, this code does not process or modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`). Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The variable `input` now holds the entire input from the standard input stream.**
