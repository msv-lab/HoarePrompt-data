Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is a dictionary; `count` is updated to `freq[(rx, ry)]` if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` for some element `a` in `arr`; `ry` is `a % y` for some element `a` in `arr`.**
