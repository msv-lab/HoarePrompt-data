Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2*t]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), ..., (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 2*t.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will hold the values from the last iteration, which are the first integer, second integer, third integer, and list of integers from the last pair of lines in `data`. The `test_cases` list will contain `t` tuples, each representing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` from each iteration. The `idx` will be `2*t`, which is the total number of lines processed in `data`.
