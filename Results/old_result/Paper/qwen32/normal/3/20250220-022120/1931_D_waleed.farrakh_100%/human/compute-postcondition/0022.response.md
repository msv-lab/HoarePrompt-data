To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is drawn from the `results` list. Therefore, the state of `results` is the only one we can adjust to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Given the context, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`. To ensure `results` has at least one element, `test_cases` must be a list with at least one tuple.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.
3. `func_1(test_cases)` will return a list with at least one element if `test_cases` contains at least one tuple.
4. `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), ..., (n, x, y, arr)]`.
5. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 to ensure `test_cases` has at least one tuple.

Given this, the necessary state adjustments are:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`.

The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `data`, `idx`) do not need to be adjusted directly to ensure the loop can execute, as they are dependent on `t` and `test_cases`.

Final State:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`**
