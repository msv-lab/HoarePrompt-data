To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

1. **Variable `t`**: It must be at least 1. However, its exact value is not specified.
2. **Variable `test_cases`**: It must contain at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`. The exact contents of this tuple are not provided.
3. **Variable `results`**: It must contain at least one more value. The exact contents of this list are not provided.
4. **Variable `result`**: It is the next value from the `results` list. The exact value of `result` is not specified but it is derived from the `results` list.

Given this information, we can only describe the output in terms of the `result` variable, which is the next value from the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the next value from the `results` list)**
