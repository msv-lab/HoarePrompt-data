Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[5]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[5]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[5]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[6]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing three tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 7.**

In simple terms, the value of `idx` has been increased by 2, so it is now 7. All other variables remain unchanged.
