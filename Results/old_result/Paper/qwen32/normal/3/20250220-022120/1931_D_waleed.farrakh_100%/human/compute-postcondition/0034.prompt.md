Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `(rx, ry)` and the value is `1` if `current_pair` was not previously in `freq`, or the value is incremented by 1 if `current_pair` was already in `freq`; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases` and has at least one element; `a` is the first element of `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(rx, ry)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `current_pair` with a value of 1; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases` and has at least one element; `a` is the second element of `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). `results` is an empty list. `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[current_pair]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `current_pair` with a value of 1. `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases` and has at least one element. `a` is the third element of `arr`. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`. `ry` is `a % y`. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
