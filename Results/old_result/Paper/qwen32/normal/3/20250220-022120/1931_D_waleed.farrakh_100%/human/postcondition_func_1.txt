The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`. It processes these test cases by calling `func_1` with a list of tuples containing the test case data. The results from `func_1` are then printed. The function does not modify the input values directly but uses them to produce and print output based on the logic implemented in `func_1`.
