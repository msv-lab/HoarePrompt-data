Postcondition: **`rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1 and `count` is updated to `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `current_pair` with a value of `1` and `count` remains unchanged. `ry` is `a % y` for the current element `a` in `arr`. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. `a` is the next element in `arr`.**
