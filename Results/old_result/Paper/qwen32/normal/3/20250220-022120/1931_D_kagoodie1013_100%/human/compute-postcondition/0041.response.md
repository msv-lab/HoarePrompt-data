The code snippet provided calculates `r_y` as `num % y`. This affects the value of `r_y` directly based on the current value of `num` and `y`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `y` is part of the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`, and `r_y` is being calculated for the first time or updated based on the current `num`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1 if it was not previously present, or incremented by 1 if it was, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, and `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`. `r_y` is updated to `num % y`.**
