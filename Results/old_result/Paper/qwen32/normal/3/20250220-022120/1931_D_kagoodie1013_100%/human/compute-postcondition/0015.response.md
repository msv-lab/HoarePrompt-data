The code snippet increments the value associated with `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary by 1. Given that `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` and `residue_map` initially has this key mapped to 1, the value will be incremented from 1 to 2.

Here is the Output State:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the second element in `arr`.**
