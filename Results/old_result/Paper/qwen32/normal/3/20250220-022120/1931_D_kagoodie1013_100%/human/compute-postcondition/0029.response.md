The code snippet `r_y = num % y` calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to the variable `r_y`. The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `arr`, and `r_x` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**
