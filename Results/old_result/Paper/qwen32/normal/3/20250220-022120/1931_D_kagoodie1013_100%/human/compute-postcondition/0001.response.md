The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. 

Here’s how we can adjust the state:

- `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple is structured as `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- Since `n`, `x`, and `y` have specific constraints, we need to ensure that the tuple inside `test_cases` adheres to these constraints.
- `results` is an empty list and does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers with each `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. `results` is an empty list.**
