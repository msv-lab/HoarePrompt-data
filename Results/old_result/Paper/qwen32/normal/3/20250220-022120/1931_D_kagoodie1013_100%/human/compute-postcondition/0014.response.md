The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable to be a tuple of `num % x` and `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` is the second element in `arr`, and `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`, we can express the new `current_key` in terms of `num`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 1; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the second element in `arr`.**
