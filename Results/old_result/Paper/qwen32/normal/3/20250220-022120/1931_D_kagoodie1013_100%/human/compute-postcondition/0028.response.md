Given the code snippet `r_x = -num % x`, we need to determine the impact on the initial state.

The initial state includes:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.
- `count` is 0.
- `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.

The variable `num` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be part of the context, possibly from the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`.

The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` computes the remainder of `-num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `r_x`.

Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we can't provide a specific value for `r_x`. However, we can express `r_x` in terms of `num` and `x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new variable `r_x` which is calculated as `-num % x`.
