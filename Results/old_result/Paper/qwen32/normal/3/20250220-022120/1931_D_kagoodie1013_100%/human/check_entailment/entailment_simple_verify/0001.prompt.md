You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in the array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads multiple test cases, each with an array \(a\) and integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it needs to determine the number of such beautiful pairs.

### Program Analysis

The program's core logic is implemented in the `func_1` function. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a `results` list to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the counts of certain residue pairs.

2. **Processing Each Number**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates two residues:
     - `r_x = -num % x`
     - `r_y = num % y`
   - It then checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to the `count` variable.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the pair \((num % x, num % y)\), incrementing its count by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all numbers in the array, it appends the `count` of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify if the program correctly identifies beautiful pairs:

- **Condition 1**: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - This can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). Thus, `r_x = -num % x` is the correct residue to check for.
  
- **Condition 2**: \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - This can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\). Thus, `r_y = num % y` is the correct residue to check for.
  
- **Counting Pairs**:
  - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of how many times each residue pair \((num % x, num % y)\) has been seen.
  - When processing each number `num`, it checks if the pair \((-num % x, num % y)\) exists in `residue_map` to find pairs that satisfy both conditions.
  - If such a pair exists, it increments the count by the number of times that pair has been seen.

The logic correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
