Let's break down the given code snippet and see how it affects the variables.

The code snippet is:
```
count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
```

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `count` is incremented by the value returned by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary with a key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2.
- `r_x` is `-num % x`.
- `r_y` is `num % y`.
- `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, which is the same as `(r_x, r_y)` in terms of the key used in the dictionary.

Given that `residue_map` has a key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2, and assuming that `current_key` (which is `(r_x, r_y)`) matches this key, the value retrieved from `residue_map` will be 2. Therefore, `count` will be incremented by 2.

If `current_key` does not match any key in `residue_map`, the default value 0 will be used, and `count` will remain unchanged.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `num` except for the structure of `test_cases` and `residue_map`, we have to consider the most likely scenario where `current_key` matches the key in `residue_map`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 3; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the third element in `arr`.**

In natural language: The `count` variable has been incremented by 2, assuming that `current_key` matches the key in `residue_map`. All other variables remain unchanged.
