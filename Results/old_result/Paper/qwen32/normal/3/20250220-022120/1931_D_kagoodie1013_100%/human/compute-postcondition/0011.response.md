The value of `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Given that `num` is the second element in `arr` and `x` is part of the first tuple in `test_cases`, the new value of `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 1; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `x % y`; `current_key` is `(n % x, n % y)`; `num` is the second element in `arr`.**
