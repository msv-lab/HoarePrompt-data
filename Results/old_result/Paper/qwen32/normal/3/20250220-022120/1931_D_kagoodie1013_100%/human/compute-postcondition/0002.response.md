The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the `test_cases` list or the `results` list. The `test_cases` list remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `arr` as described. The `results` list remains empty as no operations have been performed to modify it. The only change is the introduction of the `count` variable with a value of 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers with each `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0.**
