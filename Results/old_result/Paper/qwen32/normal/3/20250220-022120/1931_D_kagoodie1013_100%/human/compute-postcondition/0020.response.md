The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable based on the new values of `num % x` and `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 3; `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(n % x, n % y)` mapped to 2; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the third element in `arr`.**
