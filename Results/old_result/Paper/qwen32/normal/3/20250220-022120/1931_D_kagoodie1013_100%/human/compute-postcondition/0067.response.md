Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `arr` has at least one element, `num` is the next element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` plus the previous value of `count`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` as the key and its value is incremented by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, and `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value associated with `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary is increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
