Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then determines if the string `s` meets certain conditions related to the number of '1's in the string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.**
