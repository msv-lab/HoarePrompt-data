The given `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
