The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `log2(n)`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. Since `n` must be greater than 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than `log2(2)`, which is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2 (since `power` is 2).

To ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 4 (since `log2(4)` is 2). So, `n` must be greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2**
