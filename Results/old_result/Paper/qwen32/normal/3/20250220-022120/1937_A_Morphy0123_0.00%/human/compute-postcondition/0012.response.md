The value of `power` is incremented by 1. Initially, `power` is 3, so after the operation, `power` becomes 4. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 4.
Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 4**.
