Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer such that `16 <= n < 32`.
- `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.
- `n` is an integer between 16 and 31, inclusive.
- The expression `2 ** power` computes 2 raised to the power of `power`.

### Conclusion:
Since `power` is equal to `n`, and `n` can be any integer from 16 to 31, the expression `2 ** power` will evaluate to 2 raised to the power of `n`. The exact value will depend on the specific value of `n`, but it will be a number between \(2^{16}\) and \(2^{31}\).

### Output:
The print statement will output the result of \(2^{n}\), where \(n\) is an integer between 16 and 31.

Output: **2 ** n (where n is an integer such that 16 <= n < 32)**
