The value of `power` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`, and `power` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
