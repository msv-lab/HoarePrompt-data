Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2.
2. `i` is set to 2.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. If `n` is not equal to 1, then `power` is set to 3 if `power` is not already equal to `n` (where `16 <= n < 32`); otherwise, `power` remains equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement is independent of the values of `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, and `power` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
