The code snippet `power = 1` sets the variable `power` to 1. This change affects the value of `power` but does not affect the values of `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. The conditions for `power` mentioned in the initial state are no longer relevant because `power` is explicitly set to 1.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `power` is 1.**
