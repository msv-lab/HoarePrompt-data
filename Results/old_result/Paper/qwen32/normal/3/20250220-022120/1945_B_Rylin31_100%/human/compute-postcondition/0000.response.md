The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case, but these variables are not affected by the given code snippet. The variable `t` is the only one that is changed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `a`, `b`, and `m` remain as three integers for each test case where 1 â‰¤ a, b, m â‰¤ 10^18.**
