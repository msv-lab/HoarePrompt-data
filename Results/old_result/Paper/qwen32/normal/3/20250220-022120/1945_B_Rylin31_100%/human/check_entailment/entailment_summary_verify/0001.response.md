### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided function does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Let's break down why the given function is incorrect and why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Each installation launches fireworks at regular intervals (`a` and `b` minutes), and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch. The challenge is to account for the overlaps of fireworks from both installations.

#### Provided Function:
The provided function calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case. Here's why this is incorrect:

1. **Counting Fireworks:**
   - `m // a` counts how many fireworks from the first installation are launched within the first `m` minutes.
   - `m // b` counts how many fireworks from the second installation are launched within the first `m` minutes.
   - Adding these together gives the total number of fireworks launched by both installations within the first `m` minutes, without considering overlaps.

2. **Adding 2:**
   - The addition of `2` is arbitrary and does not logically follow from the problem requirements. It does not account for the visibility duration `m` or the overlaps between fireworks from the two installations.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider:
- The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping launch times.
- The number of fireworks launched by each installation up to a certain time `t` and adjust for overlaps.

A correct solution would involve iterating over a range of possible times to find the maximum overlap of fireworks, or using mathematical insights to calculate the maximum overlap directly.

#### Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the function will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
