The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken on a value that is one less than `t` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop).

Given that `t` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 to check if the loop should execute again.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The state of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remains unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers provided by the input, `i` is incremented by 1**
