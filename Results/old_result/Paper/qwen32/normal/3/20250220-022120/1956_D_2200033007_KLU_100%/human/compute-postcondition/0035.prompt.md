You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index, where arr is a list of integers and start_index is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray being considered.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index, and `is_already_stairs` is False if any `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` for `j` in the range from `0` to `i`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, for at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `i` is an integer such that 0 < i < len(arr) - start_index, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, for at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: - `i` will be `i + (n - 1)`.
        #- `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + (n - 1)]\)) will be equal to `i + (n - 1)`.
        #- `start_index` remains unchanged.
        #- `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged.
        #- `res` remains unchanged (since the problem specifies only the changes in `arr` and `i`).
        #
        #In natural language, after all iterations, the value of `i` will be incremented by the number of iterations minus one, and all elements in the array `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i + (n - 1)` will be set to this new value of `i`.
        #
        #Output State:
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `i` is an integer such that 0 < i < len(arr) - start_index, and `is_already_stairs` is either True or False. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, then `is_already_stairs` is set to True, and `arr` is modified to form a staircase pattern starting from `start_index + i - 1` to `start_index + i`. Otherwise, `i` is updated to `i + (n - 1)`, `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + (n - 1)]\)) is set to `i + (n - 1)`, `start_index` remains unchanged, `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged, and `res` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index, where `arr` is a list of integers and `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray being considered. The function returns None.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns nothing (None)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
