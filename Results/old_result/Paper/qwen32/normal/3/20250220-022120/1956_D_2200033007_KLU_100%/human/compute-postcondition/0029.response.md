Let's analyze the given state and the for loop to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `i` is an integer such that `0 < i + 1 < len(arr) - start_index`
- `start_index` is an integer
- `arr[j]` is `i`

For loop statement:
```python
for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable (`j`)**: The loop variable `j` is not part of the program state at the end of the previous iteration, but it is part of the loop head. It will be initialized to `start_index` at the start of each iteration.

2. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have reached `start_index + i`.

3. **State of `i` and `start_index`**:
   - The condition `0 < i + 1 < len(arr) - start_index` ensures that the loop can run at least once with the current `i` and `start_index`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` and `start_index` must be adjusted such that the new range `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` is valid and within the bounds of `arr`.

### Next Iteration Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `start_index + i`. For the next iteration, `j` will be re-initialized to `start_index`.
- To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` and `start_index` must be adjusted such that the new range is valid. Typically, `i` would be incremented, but since we are not modifying `i` directly in the loop head, we need to ensure the condition `0 < i + 1 < len(arr) - start_index` still holds true.

### Conclusion:
- The only variables we can adjust are `i` and `start_index`. Given the condition, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented in a way that the new range is valid.
- Assuming `i` is incremented by 1 (as a typical loop increment), the new state would be:

State: **`i` is an integer such that `0 < i + 2 < len(arr) - start_index`, `start_index` is an integer, and `arr[j]` is `i`**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time with the new values of `i` and `start_index`.
