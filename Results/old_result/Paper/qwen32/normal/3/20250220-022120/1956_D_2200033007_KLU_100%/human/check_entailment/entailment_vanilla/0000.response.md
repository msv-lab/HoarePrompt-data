Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing operations where a segment of the array is set to its MEX (minimum excluded value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by recursively considering different operations and caching results in `res_dict`.
   - It considers three main cases:
     - When the subarray length is 1, it either leaves the element as is if it's positive or sets it to 1.
     - When the subarray can be filled to achieve the maximum possible sum (which is the square of the length of the subarray), it returns this value.
     - Otherwise, it splits the subarray and considers the sum of the best possible operations on the left and right parts, including the current element.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It recursively determines the operations needed for subarrays based on the maximum value computed by `func_1`.
   - If the maximum value equals the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to fill the subarray in a way that achieves this maximum sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - This function fills a subarray from `start_index` to `start_index + i` with values from 0 to i, which is a way to achieve the maximum possible sum for that subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a "staircase" from 0 to i) and, if not, performs the necessary operations to achieve this form.

### Issues and Corrections:
1. **Global Variables:**
   - The variables `arr`, `res_dict`, `res`, and `start_index` are used without being defined within the functions. This will lead to errors.
   - These should either be passed as arguments or defined as global variables within the functions.

2. **Operation Count:**
   - The program does not explicitly count the number of operations performed. It constructs the operations but does not keep track of their count.
   - The operation count should be calculated and returned along with the maximum sum.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program does not format the output as required by the problem statement, which needs the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when the array is already in the optimal form or when the array length is 1.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is not fully correct as it does not handle global variables properly, does not count the number of operations, and does not format the output correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet all the requirements of the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
