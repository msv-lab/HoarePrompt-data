To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the given output states after the first 3 iterations:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is an integer such that \(0 < i < \text{len(arr)} - \text{start_index}\).
   - `is_already_stairs` is either `False` or `True`.
   - For at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.
   - `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.
   - `res` has a new element `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended to it.

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
       arr[j] = i
   ```

3. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time:**
   - `i` is an integer such that \(0 < i < \text{len(arr)} - \text{start_index}\).
   - `start_index` is an integer.
   - `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i]\)) is equal to `i`.

4. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times:**
   - `i` is an integer such that \(0 < i + 1 < \text{len(arr)} - \text{start_index}\).
   - `start_index` is an integer.
   - `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + 1]\)) is equal to `i + 1`.

5. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times:**
   - `i` is an integer such that \(0 < i + 2 < \text{len(arr)} - \text{start_index}\).
   - `start_index` is an integer.
   - `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + 2]\)) is equal to `i + 2`.

From the above, we can infer that after `n` iterations, `i` will be incremented by `n - 1` and the values in `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i + (n - 1)` will be set to `i + (n - 1)`.

Let's denote the total number of iterations by `n`. After `n` iterations, `i` will be `i + (n - 1)`. The range of indices in `arr` that will be set to this value will be from `start_index` to `start_index + i + (n - 1)`.

**Output State:**
- `i` will be `i + (n - 1)`.
- `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + (n - 1)]\)) will be equal to `i + (n - 1)`.
- `start_index` remains unchanged.
- `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged.
- `res` remains unchanged (since the problem specifies only the changes in `arr` and `i`).

In natural language, after all iterations, the value of `i` will be incremented by the number of iterations minus one, and all elements in the array `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i + (n - 1)` will be set to this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by the number of iterations minus one, and `arr[j]` (for \(j\) in the range \([start_index, start_index + i + (n - 1)]\)) is equal to the new value of `i`.**
