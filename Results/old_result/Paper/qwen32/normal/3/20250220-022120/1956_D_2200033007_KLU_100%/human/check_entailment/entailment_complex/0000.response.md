### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - **Method**: Uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It considers all possible ways to split the subarray and computes the sum based on the MEX operation.
   - **Correctness**: The function seems to correctly compute the maximum sum by considering all possible splits and the MEX operation. It ensures that the maximum sum is calculated efficiently using memoization.

2. **Function `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To find the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - **Method**: Recursively determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. It considers all possible splits and checks which one matches the maximum sum.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly identifies the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum by recursively checking all possible splits and comparing the results with the maximum sum.

3. **Function `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To transform the subarray into a staircase pattern.
   - **Method**: Checks if the subarray is already in a staircase pattern. If not, it modifies the subarray to form a staircase pattern and appends the corresponding operation to the result list.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly transforms the subarray into a staircase pattern and records the operations needed to achieve this transformation.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Memoization in `func_1`**: The use of memoization ensures that the function does not recompute the results for the same subarray, making the solution efficient.
- **Recursive Operations in `func_2`**: The function correctly identifies the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum by considering all possible splits and comparing the results.
- **Staircase Transformation in `make_stairs`**: The function correctly transforms the subarray into a staircase pattern, which is a key part of achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem description and the annotated functions, the program appears to correctly compute the maximum sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve this sum. The use of memoization and recursive methods ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
