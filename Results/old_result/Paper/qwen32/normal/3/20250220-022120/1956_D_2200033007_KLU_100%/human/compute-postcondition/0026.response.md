The value of `arr[j]` is set to `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that 0 < i < len(arr) - start_index. The value of `start_index` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer such that 0 < i < len(arr) - start_index, `start_index` is an integer, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 < i < len(arr) - start_index, `start_index` is an integer, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.**
