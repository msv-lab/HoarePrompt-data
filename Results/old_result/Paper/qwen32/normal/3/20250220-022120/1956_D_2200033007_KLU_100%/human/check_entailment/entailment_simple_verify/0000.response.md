### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step using the annotated code and problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations where we choose a subarray and replace all its elements with the MEX of that subarray.
- The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- The goal is to output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

#### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to recursively compute some value based on the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict`.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where it returns `max(1, arr[start_index])`.
   - For larger subarrays, it considers splitting the array and combining results, which suggests it might be trying to compute some optimal value.
   - However, it does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to decide how to split the array and generate operations.
   - It handles edge cases like single-element arrays and uses `make_stairs` for certain conditions.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function seems to be an attempt to create a staircase pattern in the array.
   - It relies on a global variable `start_index`, which is not defined within the function.
   - The logic within `make_stairs` is not clear and does not seem to directly relate to computing the MEX or maximizing the sum.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The code does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray.
   - The logic within `make_stairs` and the way `func_2` uses it are unclear and do not seem to align with the problem requirements.

2. **Lack of Global Variables**:
   - The code uses global variables like `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them in the function scope.
   - This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

3. **Logic for Finding MEX**:
   - The code does not correctly compute the MEX of any subarray.
   - The approach seems to be based on some heuristic or precomputed values rather than directly computing the MEX.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with a single element, or arrays with very large values.
   - For example, for an input like `[1, 1, 1]`, the expected output is `3 0` because no operations are needed to maximize the sum.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code does not produce the required output format, which includes the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - The provided functions do not return the correct format and do not handle the output requirements as specified in the problem statement.

#### Example Case Analysis:

Consider the input:
```
3
1 1 1
```
The MEX of the entire array is `0`, but the code does not correctly compute this and might not replace the array elements with the correct MEX values to maximize the sum. The expected output should be:
```
3 0
```
Since no operations are needed to maximize the sum. The provided code does not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. It lacks proper handling of edge cases, does not compute the MEX correctly, and does not produce the required output format.

**Final: False**
