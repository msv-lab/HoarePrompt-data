Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index, where arr is a list of integers and start_index is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray being considered; `is_already_stairs` is True.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `is_already_stairs` has been set to True. The other variables (`i`, `arr`, and `start_index`) remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
