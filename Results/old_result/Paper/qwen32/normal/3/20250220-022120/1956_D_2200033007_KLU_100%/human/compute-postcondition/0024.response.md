The given code snippet appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `start_index`, `is_already_stairs`, or the elements of `arr`. It only modifies the list `res` by adding a new element to it.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 < i < len(arr) - start_index, `is_already_stairs` is either False or True depending on the logic inside `make_stairs`. Additionally, for at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. Furthermore, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The list `res` has a new element `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended to it.**
