### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and how they fit the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the array segment from `start_index` to `end_index` after performing the allowed operations.
- **Implementation**:
  - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to avoid redundant calculations.
  - For a single element, the maximum value is `max(1, arr[start_index])`, ensuring that the result is at least 1.
  - For a segment, it considers:
    - Setting the entire segment to the MEX value, which would result in a sum of `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`.
    - Splitting the segment at each possible position and recursively calculating the maximum sums for the subsegments, adding the middle element `arr[i]`.
    - Including only the first or last element of the segment and recursively calculating the maximum sum for the rest of the segment.
- **Output**: The maximum possible sum for the segment `[start_index, end_index]`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function determines the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
- **Implementation**:
  - It uses the maximum value calculated by `func_1` for the segment `[start_index, end_index]`.
  - If the segment length is 1, it checks if the element is already positive. If not, it returns a single operation to set it to 1.
  - If the maximum value is `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`, it means the entire segment can be set to the MEX value, and it recursively calls `make_stairs` to achieve this.
  - Otherwise, it splits the segment at each possible position and recursively determines the operations for the subsegments that sum up to the maximum value.
- **Output**: A list of operations (tuples of indices) that achieve the maximum sum.

#### Function `make_stairs`:
- **Purpose**: This function modifies a subarray to form a staircase pattern, which is a sequence of increasing integers starting from 0.
- **Implementation**:
  - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern. If so, it does nothing.
  - If the subarray is not in the staircase pattern, it recursively modifies the subarray to form the staircase pattern and appends the operations to the `res` list.
- **Output**: None, but it modifies the array `arr` and appends operations to the `res` list.

### Analysis:
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve it.
- `func_1` calculates the maximum possible sum, and `func_2` determines the operations to achieve that sum.
- `make_stairs` is a helper function used by `func_2` to form the staircase pattern, which is a key part of achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it. The functions are consistent with the problem description and the provided execution summaries.

**Correctness: True**
