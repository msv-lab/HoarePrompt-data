Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Here are a few issues and potential edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The code provided is incomplete. Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` are defined, but they are not fully utilized or integrated properly. For instance, `make_stairs` is called within `func_2` but it relies on a global variable `start_index` which is not defined within the scope of the function.

2. **Lack of Global Variables**: The code uses global variables like `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them in the function scope. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior if these variables are not properly initialized elsewhere in the code.

3. **Logic for Finding MEX**: The problem requires finding the MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value) of a subarray and then replacing the subarray with this MEX value. However, the provided code does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it seems to focus on maximizing the sum based on some heuristic or precomputed values, which might not always yield the correct result.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with a single element, or arrays with very large values. For example:
   - **Single Element Array**: The code should correctly handle arrays with a single element, but it does not explicitly handle this case.
   - **All Elements Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, the MEX should be the next integer that is not in the array. The code does not ensure this.
   - **Large Values**: The code does not account for the possibility of large values in the array, which might require careful handling to ensure the MEX is computed correctly.

5. **Output Format**: The code does not produce the required output format, which includes the maximum sum and the sequence of operations. The provided functions do not return the correct format and do not handle the output requirements as specified in the problem statement.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
1 1 1
```
The MEX of the entire array is `0`, but the code does not correctly compute this and might not replace the array elements with the correct MEX values to maximize the sum. The expected output should be:
```
3 0
```
Since no operations are needed to maximize the sum. The provided code does not handle this correctly.

Thus, due to these issues and the lack of proper handling of edge cases, the program is incorrect.
