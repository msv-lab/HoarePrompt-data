The code snippet `res.append((start_index, start_index))` appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. The values of `i`, `is_already_stairs`, and the condition regarding `arr[start_index + j]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, and `i` equals 0. `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, for at least one `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.**
