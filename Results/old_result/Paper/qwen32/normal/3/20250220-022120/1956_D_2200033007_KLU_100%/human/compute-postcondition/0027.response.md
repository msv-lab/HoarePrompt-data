The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `start_index` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached `start_index + i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be reset to `start_index` and `i` and `start_index` should be adjusted such that the range still holds true.

Given that `i` is an integer such that `0 < i < len(arr) - start_index`, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i`, we need to determine the next value of `i` and `start_index` for the loop to execute again.

Since `j` is incremented in each iteration, and `j` at the end of the last iteration is `start_index + i`, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be reset to `start_index`. The next value of `i` should be such that `0 < i < len(arr) - start_index`.

Let's assume `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, and `start_index` remains the same unless there is a specific reason to change it. However, based on the given information, we can only make sure that `i` is incremented by 1 and check if it still satisfies the condition `0 < i < len(arr) - start_index`.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 < i + 1 < len(arr) - start_index, `start_index` is an integer, and `arr[j]` is equal to `i + 1`**
Since `j` is reset at the start of the loop, we don't need to specify its value explicitly in the state.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 < i + 1 < len(arr) - start_index, `start_index` is an integer**
