To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `i + 1`. The loop will execute if the range `i + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `i` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index
- `is_already_stairs` is True

Let's analyze the loop:
```
for j in range(i + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `i + 1` is greater than 0, which is always true given that `i` is at least 0 according to the provided state. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

The variable `is_already_stairs` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop. Thus, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state remains the same as the initial state provided, with the understanding that `i` ensures the loop can execute.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(arr) - start_index, `is_already_stairs` is True**
