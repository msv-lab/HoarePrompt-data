To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is the next line from the input file, a string containing three space-separated integers.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s` such that `x > k - 3`.
- `z` is `k - 1`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(x - k + 3):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on a value from `0` to `x - k + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x - k + 3` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's determine the new state:
- The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.
- The values of `x`, `k`, and `z` remain unchanged because they are not modified in the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`s` is the next line from the input file, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s` such that `x > k - 3`, `z` is `k - 1`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**. 

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express it as `i + 1`.

Final Answer:
State: **`s` is the next line from the input file, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s` such that `x > k - 3`, `z` is `k - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
