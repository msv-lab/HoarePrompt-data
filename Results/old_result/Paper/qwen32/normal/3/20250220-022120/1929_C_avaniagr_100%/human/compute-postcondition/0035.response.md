Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < x + 1` holds.**
