The code snippet takes the string `s`, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. 

Given that `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers, after executing the code, `k`, `x`, and `a` will each hold one of these integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the next line from the input file, which is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s`.**
