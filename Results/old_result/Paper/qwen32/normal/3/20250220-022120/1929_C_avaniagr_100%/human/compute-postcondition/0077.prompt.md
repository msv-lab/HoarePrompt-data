Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, k, x, and a are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, and `a` is the third integer from `s`. If `x < k - 1`, then no changes are made to `x` or `a` unless `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than `x + 2`. If `x >= k`, then `z` is defined as `2x - k + 3`, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k` is the first integer from `s`, `x` is the second integer from `s`, `a` is the third integer from `s`. If `x < k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 1` or less than `x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s` becomes "5 6 7", `k` becomes 5, `x` becomes 6, `a` becomes 7, and `z` is set to 11, with `a` either being greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the next line from the input file, which is a string containing three space-separated integers; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers derived from splitting and converting `s`. If `x < k - 1`, the condition is met if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, and `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their values. If `x == k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 2` holds true if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, and `a < x + 2` holds true if `a` is less than `x + 2`. If `x >= k`, `z` is updated to the value after `x - k + 3` iterations of the loop, and `i` is `x - k + 2`. Additionally, `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
