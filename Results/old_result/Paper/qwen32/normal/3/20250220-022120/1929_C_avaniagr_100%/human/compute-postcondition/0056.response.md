The initial state describes that `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers read from an input file. These integers are then split and converted to integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the value to be printed is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, or `a`.

Output: **YES**
