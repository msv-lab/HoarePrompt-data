To determine the new value of `z`, we need to evaluate the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` using the initial values provided.

Given:
- `z` is 6
- `k` is 5

The expression can be broken down as follows:
- `k - 1` is `5 - 1` which equals `4`
- `z // (k - 1)` is `6 // 4` which equals `1` (integer division)
- `z // (k - 1) + 1` is `1 + 1` which equals `2`
- `z += 2` means `z` is updated to `6 + 2` which equals `8`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is "5 6 7", `k` is 5, `x` is 6, `a` is 7, `z` is 8, `i` is 4**.
