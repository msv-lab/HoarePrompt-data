### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the rules of the casino. The decision is made by evaluating the initial number of coins `a` against a calculated threshold that depends on the values of `k` and `x`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Winning and Losing Rules**: 
   - If Sasha wins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
   - If Sasha loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - Sasha can lose no more than `x` times in a row.

2. **Threshold Calculation**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins.
   - If `x > k - 1`, the threshold is calculated iteratively:
     - Start with `z = k - 2`.
     - For `i` from `0` to `x - k + 2`, update `z` as `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - Sasha needs at least `z` coins.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from the input.
   - For each test case, it calculates the required threshold based on the logic above.
   - It prints "YES" if the initial number of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the threshold; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Analysis:
- The logic for determining the threshold is consistent with the problem description.
- The program correctly handles the different cases based on the values of `k` and `x`.
- The iterative calculation for the threshold when `x > k - 1` is correctly implemented and ensures that the threshold is calculated accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
