The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`, so `mak` will now be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string, `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` was '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.**
