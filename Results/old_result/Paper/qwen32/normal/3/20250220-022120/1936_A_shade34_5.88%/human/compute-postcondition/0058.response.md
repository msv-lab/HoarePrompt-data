The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, so `mak` will be updated to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. The current input is '>'**.
