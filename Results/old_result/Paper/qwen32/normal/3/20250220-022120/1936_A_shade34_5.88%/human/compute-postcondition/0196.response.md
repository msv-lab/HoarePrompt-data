Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-2` if `s` was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement, `s` is the new input string. If `s` was `'<'`, `pans` contains `[i, i]`. If `s` was `'='`, `pans` contains `[i, n-1, i]`. If `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` contains the original elements with one additional element `i`.**
