Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t` is at least 1**: This tells us that `t` is a positive integer starting from 1.
2. **`n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1**: This means `n` is derived from a new input value, specifically `n = new_input - 1`.
3. **`mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`**: This variable `mak2` holds the largest index `i` where some input was less than a certain value.
4. **`i` is `len(pans) - 1`**: This means `i` is the last index of the list `pans` if `pans` is defined.
5. **`mak` is the last index `i` where the input was `'>'` (if any), otherwise it remains unchanged**: This variable `mak` holds the last index `i` where the input was `'>'`. If no such index exists, `mak` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

### Determining the Values:
- **`mak2`**: This is the largest index `i` where the input was `<`. Since no specific input details are provided, we can only say that it holds the largest index where the condition was met.
- **`mak`**: This is the last index `i` where the input was `'>'`. If no such index exists, `mak` remains unchanged, but we do not know its initial value from the provided information.

### Output Explanation:
Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `mak2` and `mak` without more specific details about the inputs and the list `pans`. However, we can describe them based on the conditions given.

Output: **! mak2 mak (where mak2 is the largest index where the input was '<', and mak is the last index where the input was '>', or unchanged if no such index exists)**
