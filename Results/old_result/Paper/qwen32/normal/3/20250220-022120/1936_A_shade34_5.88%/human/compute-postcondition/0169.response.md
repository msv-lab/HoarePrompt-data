Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1 (but its exact value is not needed for the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 0 (so `n-1` is at least 0).
- `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<` (the exact value is not specified, but it is some integer).
- `i` is `n-1` (so `i` is a non-negative integer).
- `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<` (similarly, the exact value is not specified, but it is some integer).
- `pans` is an empty list (not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
- `mak` and `mak2` are both described as the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, but they might not necessarily be the same value. However, without more specific information, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.
- `i` is explicitly defined as `n-1`, so it is a specific value based on `n`.

### Output:
The output will be a string starting with `?`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are the largest i for which the input was <, and i is n-1)**
