The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which is now 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input and must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `i` is 1, and `pans` is unchanged.**
