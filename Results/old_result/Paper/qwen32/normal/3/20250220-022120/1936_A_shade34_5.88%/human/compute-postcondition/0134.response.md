Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `mak2` is 0 (though `mak2` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements.
- If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Determining the Output:
1. **`mak` Value**:
   - If the input is '>', then `mak` is `n`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is `0`.

2. **`i` Value**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.

3. **List `pans`**:
   - The list `pans` has at least `n + 2` elements, so `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid indices.

4. **What is printed**:
   - The print statement will output a question mark followed by four elements from the list `pans`.
   - The first two elements are `pans[mak]` and the last two elements are `pans[i]`.

### Output Description:
- If the input is '>', `mak` is `n`, so the output will be `?, pans[n], pans[n], pans[n+1], pans[n+1]`.
- If the input is not '>', `mak` is `0`, so the output will be `?, pans[0], pans[0], pans[n+1], pans[n+1]`.

Since the exact input is not provided, we need to account for both possibilities.

### Final Output:
Output: **?, pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[n+1], pans[n+1] (where mak is n if the input is '>', otherwise mak is 0)**
