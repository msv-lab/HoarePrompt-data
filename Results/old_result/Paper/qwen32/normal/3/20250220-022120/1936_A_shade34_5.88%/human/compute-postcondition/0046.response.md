The code snippet provided takes a new input string `s` and assigns it to the variable `s`, overwriting the previous value of `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `i`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is `[n]` if the new `s` was '<', `[n-1, n]` if the new `s` was '=', or `[n-1]` if the new `s` was neither '=' nor '<' and was not previously '<'.**
