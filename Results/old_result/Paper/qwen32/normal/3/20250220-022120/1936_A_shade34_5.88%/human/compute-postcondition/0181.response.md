To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` based on the conditions provided.

1. **Initial State and Variables:**
   - `t` is at least 1 (This value is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific output).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `mak` is `n-1` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`.
   - `pans` is a list containing the single element `i` if `s` is `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1` if `s` is `'='`, and `pans` remains an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`.
   - `s` is the input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determining Values:**
   - `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`. Without specific input data, we can denote it as `mak2`.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `mak` depends on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, which is `mak2`.
   - `mak2` is repeated in the print statement.

4. **Output Analysis:**
   - If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is `n-1`.
   - If `s` is not `'<'`, then `mak` is `mak2`.
   - `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`.
   - `i` is `n-2`.

Given these conditions, the output will depend on the value of `s`:
- If `s` is `'<'`, the output will be `'? n-1 mak2 n-2 mak2'`.
- If `s` is not `'<'`, the output will be `'? mak2 mak2 n-2 mak2'`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to provide a general description:
- If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` will be `n-1`.
- If `s` is not `'<'`, `mak` will be `mak2`.

Thus, the most precise description possible based on the precondition is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [n-2] [mak2] (where [mak] is n-1 if s is '<', otherwise it is mak2, and [mak2] is the largest i for which the input was '<', and [n-2] is n-2)**
