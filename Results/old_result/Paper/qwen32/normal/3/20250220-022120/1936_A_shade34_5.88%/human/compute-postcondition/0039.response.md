The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns a new list containing the current value of `i` to the variable `pans`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the new value of `pans` will be a list with a single element, `n`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string, `pans` is `[n]`.**
