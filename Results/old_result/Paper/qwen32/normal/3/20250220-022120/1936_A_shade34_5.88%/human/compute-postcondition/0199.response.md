The code snippet `mak = 0` directly assigns the value `0` to the variable `mak`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing all indices i where the input was '=' and the last index i where the input was '<' (if any).**
