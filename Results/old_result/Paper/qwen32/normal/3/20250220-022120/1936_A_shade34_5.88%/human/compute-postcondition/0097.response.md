The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, or `pans` change their values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is an empty list**.
