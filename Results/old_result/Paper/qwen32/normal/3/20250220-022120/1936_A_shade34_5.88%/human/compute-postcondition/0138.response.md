The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `pans`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and the length of `pans`. The loop iterates from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which indicates that the loop has already completed its iterations because `i` would have been incremented to `len(pans)` at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`. 

Given that `i` is `n + 1`, we need to reset `i` to the starting value of the loop, which is `1`, to ensure the loop can execute again. The length of `pans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is 1, and `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements. If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to `n + 1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
