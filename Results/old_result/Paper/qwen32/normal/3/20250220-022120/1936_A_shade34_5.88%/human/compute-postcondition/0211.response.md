To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(pans)` in this case. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans)`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1
- `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`
- `i` is `n`
- `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements where the input was '=' and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any). If the input is `>`, then `mak` is set to `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1`.

The length of `pans` (`len(pans)`) does not need to be adjusted because it determines the upper bound of the loop and is not modified within the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is at least 1 (unchanged)
- `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1 (unchanged)
- `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<` (unchanged)
- `i` is `n + 1` (incremented from the previous value of `i`)
- `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements where the input was '=' and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any) (unchanged)

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements where the input was '=' and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any)**
