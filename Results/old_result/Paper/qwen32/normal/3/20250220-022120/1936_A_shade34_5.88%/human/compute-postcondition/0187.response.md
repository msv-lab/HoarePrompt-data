Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-2`, `mak` is `n-1` if `s` was `'<'` before the if statement, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the elements `i` and `n-1`. If `s` is not `'='`, `pans` remains unchanged from its initial state, which could be a list containing `i` if `s` was `'<'` initially, a list containing `n-1` if `s` was `'='` initially, or an empty list if `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='` initially. `s` is the new input string.**
