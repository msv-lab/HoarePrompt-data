Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements, and `mak` is `n + 1`. If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0. However, in this case, `mak` is set to `i`, which is `n + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `mak` is now `n + 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged except for `mak`.
