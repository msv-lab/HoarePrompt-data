Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than `len(pans)`.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `i` is `len(pans)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes a literal string `'?'` followed by four variables: `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- Notice that `mak2` is mentioned in the initial state, but it is not used in the print statement. Instead, there is a variable `mak` which is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
- Since `mak` is not defined, we can't determine its exact value from the given information. However, the problem asks for a precise description based on the information provided.
- `i` is explicitly defined as `len(pans)` in the initial state.

### Output Description:
- The first part of the output is the literal string `'?'`.
- The next two parts are `mak`, which is an undefined variable in the given initial state.
- The last two parts are `i`, which is `len(pans)`.

Given that `mak` is not defined, we can't provide a specific value for it, but we can describe its role in the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where mak is an undefined variable and i is the length of the list pans)**
