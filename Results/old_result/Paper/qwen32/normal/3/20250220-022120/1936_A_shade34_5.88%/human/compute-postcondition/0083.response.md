Given the initial state provided:

- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the integer value of the input and must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `pans` is unchanged (though `pans` is not used in the print statement).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what each variable represents in the context of the print statement:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0 (repeated).
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1 (repeated).

Therefore, the print statement will output the literal string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i` as specified.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
