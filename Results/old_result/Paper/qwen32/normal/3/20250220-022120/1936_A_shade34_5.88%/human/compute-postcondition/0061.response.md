Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `i`.
- `mak` is set to `n-1` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`.
- `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements.

### Key Points to Note:
- `mak` is either `n-1` (if the input was '>') or `0` (otherwise).
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements.

### Print Statement Breakdown:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is either `0` or `n-1`, we need to consider both cases:
  - If `mak` is `0`, then `pans[mak]` is the first element of `pans`.
  - If `mak` is `n-1`, then `pans[mak]` is the element at index `n-1` of `pans`.
- `pans[i]`: Since `i` is set to `n`, `pans[i]` is the element at index `n` of `pans`. However, since `pans` is a list of indices and `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, it implies that `n` is within the bounds of the list `pans` (as `pans` must have at least 3 elements and `n` is at least 1).
  - If `mak` is `0`, then `pans[i]` is the element at index `n` of `pans`.
  - If `mak` is `n-1`, then `pans[i]` is still the element at index `n` of `pans`.

### Conclusion:
- The print statement will output `?`, followed by two values from `pans[mak]` and two values from `pans[i]`.
- Since `mak` can be either `0` or `n-1`, and `i` is `n`, the output will depend on the values at these indices in `pans`.

### Final Output Description:
- If `mak` is `0`, the output will be `?`, `pans[0]`, `pans[0]`, `pans[n]`, `pans[n]`.
- If `mak` is `n-1`, the output will be `?`, `pans[n-1]`, `pans[n-1]`, `pans[n]`, `pans[n]`.

Given that `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements and `n` and `mak` are defined as per the conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[n]] [pans[n]] (where mak is either 0 or n-1, and pans is a list with at least 3 elements)**
