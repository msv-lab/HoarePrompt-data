Output State: **`t` test cases have been processed, each with an integer `n` and a hidden permutation `p`. For each test case, the function has found and printed two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `i` are in a state as they were after the last iteration of the inner loops for the final test case.**

In simpler terms, after all the test cases have been processed, the function has identified and printed the pair of indices for each permutation that results in the maximum XOR value. The variables used within the loop are in their final state as they were after the last test case was handled.
