Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to '<'. If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list containing `[n-1]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
