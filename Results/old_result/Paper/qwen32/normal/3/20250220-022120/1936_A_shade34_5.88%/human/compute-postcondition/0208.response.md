The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This line of code flushes the internal buffer of the standard output (stdout), ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect any variables or their values. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements where the input was '=' and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any)**.
