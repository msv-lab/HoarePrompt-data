Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `mak2` is 0 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `i` is 1.
- `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements.
- If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to `n + 1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `mak` is determined based on the input. If the input is '>', `mak` is `n + 1`. Otherwise, `mak` is 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `pans` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements, so it has enough elements to access `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If the input is not '>'**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - The print statement will output: `?, pans[0], pans[0], pans[1], pans[1]`.

2. **If the input is '>'**:
   - `mak` is `n + 1`.
   - The print statement will output: `?, pans[n + 1], pans[n + 1], pans[1], pans[1]`.

### Output Description:
- The output will always start with `?`.
- The second and third elements printed are `pans[mak]`, which depends on the input.
- The fourth and fifth elements printed are `pans[i]`, which is `pans[1]`.

### Final Output:
Based on the given conditions, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[mak]], [pans[mak]], [pans[1]], [pans[1]] (where mak is n + 1 if the input is '>', otherwise mak is 0, and pans is a list with at least n + 2 elements)**
