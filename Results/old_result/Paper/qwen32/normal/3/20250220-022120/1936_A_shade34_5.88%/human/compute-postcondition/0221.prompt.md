You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` does not take any input parameters directly. Instead, it interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) followed by a hidden permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make queries to the system by printing lines in the format "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and it will receive a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of the bitwise OR operations on the elements of the permutation. The function must find two indices i and j such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized and print the result in the format "! i j" without exceeding 3n queries per test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, mak)
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: `t` test cases have been processed, each with an integer `n` and a hidden permutation `p`. For each test case, the function has found and printed two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `i` are in a state as they were after the last iteration of the inner loops for the final test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not accept any direct input parameters but interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, an integer `n` and a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can query the system to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of the permutation and must find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. The function should then output the indices `i` and `j` in the format "! i j" without exceeding 3n queries per test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
