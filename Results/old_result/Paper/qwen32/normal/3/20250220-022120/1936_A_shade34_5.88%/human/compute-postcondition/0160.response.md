The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(pans)` and `n` is greater than `len(pans)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `len(pans) + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same and must still be greater than `len(pans) + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, and `mak`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `len(pans) + 1`, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) + 1`**
