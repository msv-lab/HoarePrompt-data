The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is `n + 1` and all other variables remain unchanged, the output state will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest `i` for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements where the input was '=' and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any), `mak` is `n + 1`**.
