Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1` if `s` is `'<'` otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing the single element `i` if `s` is `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1` if `s` is `'='`, and `pans` remains an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `s` is the input string.**
