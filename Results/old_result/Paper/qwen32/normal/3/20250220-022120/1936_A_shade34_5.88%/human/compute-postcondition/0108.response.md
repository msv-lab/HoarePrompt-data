Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mak` is:
  - `n-1` if the current value of `s` is `'<'`.
  - Otherwise, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pans` is:
  - `[n-1]` if `s` is `'<'` or `s` is `'='`.
  - Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.
- `s` is the input string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` and `mak2` are described as being the same value.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be `n-1`.
- The value of `mak` and `mak2` depends on the value of `s`:
  - If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` and `mak2` are both `n-1`.
  - If `s` is not `'<'`, then `mak` and `mak2` are the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed.

### Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is either `n-1` (if `s` is `'<'`) or the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, we can describe the output as:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [n-1] [mak] (where mak is n-1 if s is '<', otherwise it is the highest value of i for which the input was '<' or 0)**
