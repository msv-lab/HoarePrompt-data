The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n`. However, if `i` becomes `n`, the loop condition `i in range(n)` will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased by 1, making `n` equal to `n+1` and `i` equal to `n`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string. If `s` is equal to '<', `pans` is `[n-1]`. If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is `[n-1]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
