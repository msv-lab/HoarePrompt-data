The variable `i` is assigned the value `n - 2`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `arr` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500. The variable `ans` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `10`. The only change in the state is the assignment of `i`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `10`, `i` is `n - 2`.**
