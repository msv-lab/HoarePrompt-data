The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 4`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so it should be `n - 5`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 3; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` not equal to `n-3`, `ans[n-3]` is `ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`, and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 5`**
