The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, `u` is the first integer provided as input, `v` is the second integer provided as input.**
