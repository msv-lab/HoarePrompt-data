The only object in the loop head is the variable `key`, which iterates over the keys in the dictionary `nodes`. To ensure that the loop executes, `nodes` must contain at least one key. 

Given that `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list`, it will automatically create an empty list for any new key. However, for the loop to execute, there must be at least one key present in `nodes` initially.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and must contain at least one key, `i` is `n-1`, `ends` is an empty list**
