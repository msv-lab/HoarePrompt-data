The code snippet provided is:

```python
prev = curr
```

This line of code updates the value of `prev` to be the same as `curr`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `t` is the integer provided as input
- `edges` is an empty list
- `empty` is `True`
- `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `nodes[s]` contains `s` and possibly another element
- `i` is `n-1`
- `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree
- `s` is the first element of `ends`
- `e` is the second element of `ends`
- `tree` is a list containing the value of `s` twice and `curr`
- `prev` is `s`
- `curr` is `nodes[s][1]`

After executing the line `prev = curr`, the value of `prev` is updated to be the same as `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is the integer provided as input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `nodes[s]` contains `s` and possibly another element; `i` is `n-1`; `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the value of `s` twice and `curr`; `prev` is `nodes[s][1]`; `curr` is `nodes[s][1]`**.
