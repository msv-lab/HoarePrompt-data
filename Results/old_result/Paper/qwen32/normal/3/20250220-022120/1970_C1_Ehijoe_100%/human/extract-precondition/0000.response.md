Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (which is 1 integer in this case) representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**
