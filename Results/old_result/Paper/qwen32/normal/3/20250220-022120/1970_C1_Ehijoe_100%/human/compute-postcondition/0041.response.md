Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `nodes[s]` contains `s` and possibly another element, `i` is `n-1`, `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the value of `s` twice, `prev` is `s`, and `curr` is either `nodes[s][1]` if `nodes[curr][0] == prev`, otherwise `curr` is `s`.**
