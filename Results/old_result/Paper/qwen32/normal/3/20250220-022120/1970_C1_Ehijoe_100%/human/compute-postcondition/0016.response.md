Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where each node `u` has a list of adjacent nodes `v` (representing an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges), `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, you will have a graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges represented by the `nodes` defaultdict. Each node `u` in this graph will have a list of nodes `v` that it is connected to, forming an undirected graph. The variables `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `i` will have reached the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
