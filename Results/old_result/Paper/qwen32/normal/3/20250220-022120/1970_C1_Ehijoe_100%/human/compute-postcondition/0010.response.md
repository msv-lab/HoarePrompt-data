The code snippet `nodes[u].append(v)` modifies the `nodes` dictionary by appending `v` to the list that is the value for the key `u`. This means that `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` is the first integer provided as new input, `v` is the second integer provided as new input, `i` is 1, `nodes[u]` includes `v`.**
