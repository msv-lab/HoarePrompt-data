The code snippet `nodes[u].append(v)` modifies the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict by appending the value `v` to it. This means that `nodes[u]` now includes `v`, and the relationship between `u` and `v` is updated in the graph structure represented by `nodes`.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` and `v` are the integers provided as new input, `i` is 2.**
