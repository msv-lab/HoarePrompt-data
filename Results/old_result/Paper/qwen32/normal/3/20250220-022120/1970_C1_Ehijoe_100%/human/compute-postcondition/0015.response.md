The code `nodes[v].append(u)` modifies the `nodes` dictionary by appending the integer `u` to the list associated with the key `v`. This change affects the `nodes` dictionary, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` and `v` are the integers provided as new input, `i` is 2, and `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.**
