You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initialization of `arr`**: The code groups consecutive identical elements in the `nums` array and stores their start and end indices along with the value in `arr`. However, the logic to handle queries is flawed.

2. **Query Handling**: The code uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle queries where there are only identical elements in the range `[l, r]`. It also does not handle cases where the segment found by `bisect_left` does not overlap with the query range `[l, r]` in a way that allows finding a pair of different elements.

Let's consider a specific test case where the provided code fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
1
1 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
```

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
2 3
```

This test case seems to work, but let's consider another one:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1 -1
```

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
2 3
```

In this case, the provided code incorrectly outputs `2 3` because it does not correctly handle the scenario where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are identical.

Another problematic test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
1
2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
```

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
-1 -1
```

In this case, the provided code incorrectly outputs `-1 -1` because it does not correctly handle the scenario where there are multiple different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

Given these examples, the code does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
