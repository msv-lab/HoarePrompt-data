The code snippet `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` updates the value of `eli` to the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated), `num` is -1, `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` is N + 1, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input in this iteration, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, and `e` is the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated). The input value for the next iteration is decremented by 1.**

In simple terms, `eli` has been updated to the correct insertion index for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
