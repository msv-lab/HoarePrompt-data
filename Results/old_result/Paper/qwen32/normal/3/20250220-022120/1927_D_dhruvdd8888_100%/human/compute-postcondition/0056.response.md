The provided code snippet is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement explicitly prints `-1` followed by `-1`.

Given that the print statement does not reference any variables or conditions from the initial state, we can directly conclude the output.

Output: **-1, -1**
