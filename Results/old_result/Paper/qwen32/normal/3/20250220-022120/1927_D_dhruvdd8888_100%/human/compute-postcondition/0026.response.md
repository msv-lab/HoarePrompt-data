In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input value itself, which determines how many times the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `N` is an integer read from the input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it
- `s` is the starting index of the last segment
- `num` is -1
- `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`
- `i` is N + 1
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that determines the number of iterations. To ensure the loop executes at least once, the input value should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, `s` is the starting index of the last segment, `num` is -1, `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` is N + 1, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, and the input value for the loop is at least 1**
