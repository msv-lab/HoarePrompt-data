Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input.**

Natural Language: The variable `N` is assigned the value read from the input, which is expected to be an integer. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`) retain their initial states as described.
