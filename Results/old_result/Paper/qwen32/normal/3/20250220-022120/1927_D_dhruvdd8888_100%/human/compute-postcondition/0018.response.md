The code snippet `num = nums[i]` simply updates the value of `num` to the value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is now `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it and `s` is updated to the value of `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`.**
In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` remains the same integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` remains the same list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` has been incremented by 1; `num` is now equal to `nums[i]`. The conditions for `arr` and `s` remain unchanged.
