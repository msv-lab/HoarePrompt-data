Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is now `nums[i]`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it; `s` is updated to the value of `i`.**

In natural language: The value of `s` is now equal to the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
