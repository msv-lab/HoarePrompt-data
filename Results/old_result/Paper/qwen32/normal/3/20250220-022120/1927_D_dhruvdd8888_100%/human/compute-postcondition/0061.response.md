The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state; it only updates the values of `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated), `num` is -1, `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` is N + 1, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input in this iteration, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, and `e` is the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated). The input value for the next iteration is decremented by 1.**
