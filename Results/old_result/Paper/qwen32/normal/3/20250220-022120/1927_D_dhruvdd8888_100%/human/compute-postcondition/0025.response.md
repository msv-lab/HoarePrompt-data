The variable `LA` is assigned the value of `len(arr) - 1`, which is the length of the list `arr` minus one. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `num`, or `i`. Therefore, the only change is the new value assigned to `LA`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is the starting index of the last segment; `num` is -1; `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`; `i` is N + 1; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
