The code snippet `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` updates the value of `eli` by finding the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. This does not affect any other variables except `eli`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`, `num` is -1, `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` is N + 1, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, and `e` is the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`. If `s > l`, then if `s == 1` or `s > r`, the state remains as described, otherwise `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is not greater than `r`. If `s <= l`, then if `e >= r`, the conditions remain as described, otherwise `e < r` and `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`. The input value for the next iteration is decremented by 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `eli` is updated to the position where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the sorted list `arr` to keep it sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.
