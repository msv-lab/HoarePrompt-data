The code snippet reads a tuple of two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `i`, `LA`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, `s` is the starting index of the last segment, `num` is -1, `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`, `i` is N + 1, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.**
