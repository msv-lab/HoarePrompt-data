The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used in the `range(N + 1)` function. The loop will execute if `N + 1` is greater than 0. Since `N` is an integer read from the input, we need to ensure that `N` is at least 0 for the loop to execute. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `N + 1` is greater than 0, which means `N` must be at least 0.
2. The variable `i` is not something we can directly modify in the state before the loop starts, as it is initialized within the loop. However, we can ensure that `N` is set appropriately to allow the loop to run.

Given this, we need to adjust the state so that `N` is at least 0. Since `t` and the contents of `nums` are not directly related to whether the loop can execute, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list**
