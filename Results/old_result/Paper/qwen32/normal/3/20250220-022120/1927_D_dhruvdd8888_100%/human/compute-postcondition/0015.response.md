The code appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. The variables `t`, `N`, `nums`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged except for the updated state of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is now `nums[i]`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it.**
