To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(s - 1, s)`, we need to understand the state of the variables `s` and `s - 1` based on the provided initial state.

### Key Variables and Conditions:
- `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, where `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
- `l` and `r` are two integers read from the input.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `eli`**: `eli` is the position where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted to keep `arr` sorted. This means `eli` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list of starting indices of segments in `arr`.
2. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`**: This will be the index of the segment in `arr` that either starts at `l` or is the closest segment starting index to `l` in `arr`.
3. **Determine `s`**: `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Since `s` is the starting index of a segment, it is an integer value representing the start of a contiguous segment in `nums`. The value of `s` depends on the position of `l` relative to the segments in `arr`.

### Output:
The print statement `print(s - 1, s)` will output the values of `s - 1` and `s`.

- `s - 1` is simply one less than the starting index `s`.
- `s` is the starting index of the segment in `nums`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not explicitly given but is determined by the position of `l` in the sorted list of segment starting indices in `arr`, the output will be in terms of `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the starting index of the segment at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
