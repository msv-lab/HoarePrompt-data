Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] != num`, then `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it and `s` is equal to `i`.**
