To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop:

The loop iterates `N + 1` times, where `N` is the number of integers read from the input, and an additional `-1` is appended to the list `nums`. The loop's purpose is to identify contiguous segments of identical numbers in the list `nums` and store the start index, end index, and the number in the list `arr`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `num` is initialized to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `N` (inclusive):
     - If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`:
       - Append a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`.
       - Update `s` to `i`.
     - Update `num` to `nums[i]`.

3. **Final Iteration**:
   - The final iteration (when `i = N`) ensures that the last segment is added to `arr` because `nums[N]` is `-1`, which is different from any valid number in `nums`.

**Output State**:
- After the loop completes all `N + 1` iterations, `arr` will contain tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `s` will be the starting index of the last segment.
- `num` will be `-1` (the last element in `nums`).
- `i` will be `N + 1` (the loop has completed all iterations).

**Output State in the Required Format**:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is the starting index of the last segment; `num` is -1; `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`; `i` is N + 1.**

In natural language, the final output state means that the loop has identified all segments of identical numbers in the input list `nums` and stored them in `arr` as tuples of (start index, end index, number). The variable `s` holds the starting index of the last segment, `num` is set to `-1` (the last element in `nums`), and `i` has completed all iterations, reaching `N + 1`.
