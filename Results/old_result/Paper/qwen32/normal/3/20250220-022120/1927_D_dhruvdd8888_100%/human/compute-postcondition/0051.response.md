The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the values `-1, -1`. This statement is executed regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state because it is a direct print of the constants `-1` and `-1`.

Here's a breakdown of the initial state to ensure clarity:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `N` is an integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional `-1` appended to it.
- `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `num` is -1.
- `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `i` is N + 1.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
- `e` is the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
- The conditions involving `s`, `l`, `r`, and `e` describe specific logical checks but do not affect the `print` statement directly.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their values described in the initial state. It simply prints the two constants `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
