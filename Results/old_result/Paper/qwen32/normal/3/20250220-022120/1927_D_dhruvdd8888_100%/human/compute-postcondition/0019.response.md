The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop runs for `i` in `range(N + 1)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `N`.

To execute one more iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `N` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_current`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_current + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `i_current` at the end of the last iteration, it should be `i_current + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < N + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is `i_current + 1`; `num` is now `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it and `s` is updated to the value of `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`.**

To make it more specific, let's assume `i_current` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`; `num` is now `nums[i + 1]`. If `nums[i + 1]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i + 1, num)` appended to it and `s` is updated to the value of `i + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`.**

However, since we are only concerned with the variables in the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`.**
