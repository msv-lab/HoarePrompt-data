The `print` statement in the provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, separated by a space. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the `print` statement and do not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
