Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `2` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` has been incremented by 1. If `a` was `'0'`, `x` is now `2` and `y` remains `0`. If `a` was not `'0'`, `x` is now `1` and `y` remains `1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `S`, and `s` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `x`.
