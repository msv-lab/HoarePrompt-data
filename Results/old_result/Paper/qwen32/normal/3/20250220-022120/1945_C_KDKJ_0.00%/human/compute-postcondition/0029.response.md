The code snippet calculates the `right` variable as the difference between the cumulative count of non-`'0'`s up to the last character in the string `a` and the cumulative count of non-`'0'`s up to the `i`-th character in the string `a`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `a`, `S`, `ans`, `satisfy`, `left`, and `lsum` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `right`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is the cumulative count of `'0'`s up to the `i`-th character in the string `a`, `lsum` is the sum of `S[i][0]` and `S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.**
