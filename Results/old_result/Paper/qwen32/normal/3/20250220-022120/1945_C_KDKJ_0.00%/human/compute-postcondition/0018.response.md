The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given that `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`, the last element of `S` is `[x, y]`. Therefore, `x` and `y` will take the values of the elements in the last sublist of `S`, which are the `x` and `y` from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]` where `x` and `y` are determined by the value of `s` (the next character in `a`) and `a` as described above, `s` is the next character in `a`, `x` is the value of `x` from the last sublist of `S`, `y` is the value of `y` from the last sublist of `S`.**
