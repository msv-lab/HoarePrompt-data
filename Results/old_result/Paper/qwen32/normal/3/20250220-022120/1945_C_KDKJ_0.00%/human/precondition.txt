The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses in the village. The next line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates that the resident of the house wants to live on the left side of the street, and '1' indicates that the resident wants to live on the right side of the street. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
