Since the code snippet provided is simply calling a function `func_1()` again, and there is no additional information about what `func_1()` does, we can only assume that calling `func_1()` again does not change the precondition that the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0. 

Given that we do not have any other variables or changes in the state from the function call, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0; `func_1()` has been called.**
