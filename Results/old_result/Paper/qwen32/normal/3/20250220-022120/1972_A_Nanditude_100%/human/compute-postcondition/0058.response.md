The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was either 0 or 1, so after the increment, `cnt` will be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, and `cnt` is either 1 or 2.**
