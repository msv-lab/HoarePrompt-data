The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string parts, converts each of those parts into an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to `b`. 

Given the initial state, `b` was already defined as a list of integers. After the execution of the code, `b` is reassigned to a new list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9)**.
