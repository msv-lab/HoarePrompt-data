Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of length `n` (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of length `n` (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than elements in `a` until `a[i]` is no longer exceeded by `b[j]`, `i` is the count of elements in `a` that have been matched or exceeded by elements in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the same integer input by the user, `a` is the same list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is the same list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`, `i` is the count of elements in `a` that have been compared and found to be less than or equal to elements in `b` (or `n` if all elements in `a` have been compared), `j` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is t, n is the same integer input by the user, a is the new list of integers input by the user, b is the new list of integers input by the user, cnt is the total number of times an element in b is less than the current element in a, i is the number of elements in a that have been fully compared with all elements in b, and j is n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
