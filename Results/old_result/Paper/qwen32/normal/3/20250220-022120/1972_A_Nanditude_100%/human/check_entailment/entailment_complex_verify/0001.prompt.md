You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
    
    800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
    
    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Output

    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three parts: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems, a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9) representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The function should handle up to 100 test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: t is 0, n is the same integer input by the user, a is a list of length n consisting of integers input by the user, b is a list of length n consisting of integers input by the user, cnt is the count of elements in b that are less than the corresponding elements in a for the last iteration, i is the count of elements in a that have been fully compared with all elements in b for the last iteration, and j is n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 100 test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b` of the same length `n`. For each test case, it counts how many elements in list `b` are less than the corresponding elements in list `a` and prints this count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to ensure that each problem's actual difficulty `a_i` does not exceed its expected difficulty `b_i`. If `a_i` exceeds `b_i`, we need to insert a new problem with a difficulty `w` such that after sorting and removing the most difficult problem, the new `a_i` is less than or equal to `b_i`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a two-pointer technique. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of problems.
     - `a`: List of actual difficulties, already sorted.
     - `b`: List of expected difficulties, already sorted.
     - `cnt`: Counter to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
     - `i`: Pointer for the list `a`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - Iterate through each element in `b` using pointer `j`.
   - If the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`, it indicates that a new problem needs to be proposed to replace `a[i]`. Thus, increment the counter `cnt`.
   - If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, it means the current problem meets the expected difficulty, so move the pointer `i` to the next problem in `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all problems in `b` for a test case, print the counter `cnt`.

### Correctness Check:
The logic in the program is flawed. The key issue is that the program does not actually simulate the process of inserting new problems and sorting the list `a`. Instead, it assumes that the number of new problems needed is simply the number of times an `a[i]` exceeds a `b[j]`. This is incorrect because inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one can affect the subsequent comparisons.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```
The program will output `2` because `a[0] > b[0]` and `a[1] > b[1]`. However, as explained in the problem statement, we need to insert problems with difficulties `800` and `1800` to achieve the desired result, which is correct, but the program's logic does not account for the actual insertion and sorting process.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement. It only counts the number of times an actual difficulty exceeds an expected difficulty without considering the effect of inserting and removing problems.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
