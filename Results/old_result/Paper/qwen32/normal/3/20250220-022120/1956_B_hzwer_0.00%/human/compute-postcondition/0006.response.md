To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the given state.

The `for` loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop variable is `j`, and it ranges from `n - 1` down to `0`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`.

Since `n` must be at least 3, the range of `j` will be from `2` down to `0` (because `n - 1` would be `2` if `n` is `3`).

The state of `cards` and `dp` are not directly related to the loop's execution, but they are part of the program state. The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `n` itself, as it must be at least 3 to make the range valid.

The variable `j` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it is initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state does not need further adjustment for `j` or `cards` and `dp` since they do not affect the loop's execution directly. The only requirement is that `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`**
