Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated for all `i` from `n - 3` down to `0` and all `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic.**

In simpler terms: After all iterations of the loop, the `dp` table is completely filled in for all relevant indices, with each cell `dp[i][j]` determined by the number of times `j + 1` appears in the `cards` list and the specified rules. The values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, while every other cell in the `dp` table has been computed based on the loop's logic.
