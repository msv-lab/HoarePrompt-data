The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been some value between `0` and `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, provided it is still within the range.

Given that the loop condition is `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, the loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. After the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k <= n - 1`). For the next iteration, `j` should be `k - 1` (as long as `k - 1` is still within the range).

Since we do not know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can say that for the loop to continue, `j` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`. `j` is decremented by 1 from its current value**
