The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of two possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Given that `dp[i][j]` is being updated, this variable's value changes according to the provided formula.

The preconditions that remain valid are:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`.
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`.

The only change is the value of `dp[i][j]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`, and other elements remain `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`.**
