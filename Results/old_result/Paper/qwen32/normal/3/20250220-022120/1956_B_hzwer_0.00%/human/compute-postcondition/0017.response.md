The provided code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. This means that the value at position `[i][j]` in the `dp` list will now be the same as the value at position `[i + 1][j]`.

Given that `j` is decremented by 1 from its current value before this line of code, we need to consider this in the context of the overall state. However, the code snippet itself only modifies the `dp` list based on the current values of `i` and `j`.

Since the initial state specifies that `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` and most of its elements are `0`, and only `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` are `0` (which is redundant as they are already `0`), the impact of this code is limited to the specific indices `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `j` has been decremented by 1.**
