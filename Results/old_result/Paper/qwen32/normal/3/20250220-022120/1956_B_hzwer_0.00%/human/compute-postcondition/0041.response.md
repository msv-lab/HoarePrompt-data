The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 2`, this operation updates the `dp` table at position `[n-3][n-2]` to the value at position `[n-2][n-2]`.

Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least `1`, and `j` is `n - 2`. `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**
