You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1()` takes no explicit input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: The `dp` table is fully updated for all `i` from `n - 3` down to `0` and all `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the final calculated value in the `dp` table at position `[0][0]` after all iterations and updates.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs to compute and return the final value stored in the `dp` table at position `[0][0]` after performing all necessary iterations and updates.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the final calculated value in the `dp` table at position `[0][0]` after all iterations and updates.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
