The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` is currently `n - 1` and the loop iterates in reverse order down to `0`.

Given that `j` is currently `n - 1`, the next iteration would involve decrementing `j` by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n - 2`.

The other variables (`dp`, `i`, `n`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted. `i` is `n - 3` and `n` remains the same, while `dp` is already fully updated for the current iteration.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least `1`, and `j` is `n - 2`.**
