The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` starts from `n - 3` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `n - 2` (since it decrements after each iteration).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic. `i` is `n - 3`**
