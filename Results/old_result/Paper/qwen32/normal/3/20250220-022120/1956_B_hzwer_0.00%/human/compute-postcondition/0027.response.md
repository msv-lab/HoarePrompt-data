Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Otherwise, if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.**
