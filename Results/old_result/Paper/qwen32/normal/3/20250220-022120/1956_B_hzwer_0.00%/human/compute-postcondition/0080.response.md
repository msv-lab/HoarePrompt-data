Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a sequence of `n` integers. It processes these inputs to compute and return the maximum number of cards that can be collected under specific rules, represented by the value stored in the `dp` table at position `[0][0]`.**
