The code snippet sets `dp[n - 2][0]` to `0`. Since `dp[n - 1][0]` was already `0` and no other variables are affected, the only change is to `dp[n - 2][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`.**
