The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The `dp` table is still fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, except for the specific cell `dp[i][j]` which has now been reassigned. The other variables and the state of the program remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with `dp[i][j]` now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`; `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 3`.**
