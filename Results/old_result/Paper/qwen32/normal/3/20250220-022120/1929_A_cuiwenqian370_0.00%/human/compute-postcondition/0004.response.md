To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `left <= right`.

Given:
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n - 1`.

The condition `left <= right` will be true if `0 <= n - 1`. This inequality holds true as long as `n` is at least 1. However, we are given that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`.

Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, `right` will be at least 1 (`right = n - 1`), and thus `left <= right` will always be true.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `left` and `right` for the loop to execute the first time. The provided state already ensures that the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`**
