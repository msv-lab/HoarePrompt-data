The variable `right` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `new_arr`, and `left` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.**
