The code snippet appends the element at index `right` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. The only change is that `new_arr` now includes the element `arr[right]` at its end.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `left` equals `right`, set `left` to `right - 1`. Otherwise, no adjustment is needed as `left` is already less than `right`. `new_arr` includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it.**
