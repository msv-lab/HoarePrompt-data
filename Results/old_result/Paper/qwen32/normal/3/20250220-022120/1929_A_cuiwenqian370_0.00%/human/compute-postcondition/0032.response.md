Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of `n` integers where elements are arranged in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on, starting with the largest element; `left` is `n`; `right` is `n - 1`; `max_beauty` is updated to `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1]) + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `max_beauty` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
