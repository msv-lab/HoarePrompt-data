Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `n` and the list `arr` remain unchanged. A new variable `new_arr` is introduced and initialized as an empty list.
