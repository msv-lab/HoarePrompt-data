To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the provided initial and intermediate states.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, it updates the `max_beauty` variable by adding the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element in `new_arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `new_arr` is arranged in a specific order: largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on.
- `left` is `n`.
- `right` is `n - 1`.
- `max_beauty` is 0.

In each iteration, `max_beauty` is updated as follows:
- After the 1st iteration (`i = 1`), `max_beauty` becomes `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`.
- After the 2nd iteration (`i = 2`), `max_beauty` becomes `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`.
- After the 3rd iteration (`i = 3`), `max_beauty` becomes `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`.

Following this pattern, after all `n-1` iterations, `max_beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged throughout the loop iterations as they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations will be:
- `new_arr` remains the same as the initial state.
- `left` remains `n`.
- `right` remains `n - 1`.
- `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `max_beauty` will be the total of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the `new_arr` list, while `left` and `right` will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of `n` integers where elements are arranged in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on, starting with the largest element; `left` is `n`; `right` is `n - 1`; `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.**
