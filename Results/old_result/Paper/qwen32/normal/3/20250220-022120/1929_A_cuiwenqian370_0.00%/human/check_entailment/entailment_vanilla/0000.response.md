To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if the approach used by the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It calls the function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty.
4. Inside `func_1`, the array is sorted.
5. The sorted array is then rearranged in an alternating order of the largest and smallest remaining elements.
6. The beauty of the rearranged array is computed by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
7. The result for each test case is printed.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the approach in `func_1` is correct:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array is a good initial step as it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, we maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the difference between a large number and a small number is maximized when they are placed next to each other.
3. **Computing the Beauty**: The beauty is computed correctly by summing the absolute differences of the rearranged array.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `3, 2 1 3`
- Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Rearranged array: `[1, 3, 2]` (or `[3, 1, 2]`, both yield the same beauty)
- Beauty: \(|3-1| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\) (or \(|1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\))

However, the example output is `2`, which suggests that the optimal rearrangement might actually be `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]`:
- Rearranged array: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: \(|2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\)

This confirms that the rearrangement strategy used in `func_1` is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements after sorting. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
