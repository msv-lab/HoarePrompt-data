Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. `left` is incremented by 1. If `left` was equal to `right` before the increment, `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left - 1]` (which is the same as `arr[right]`) appended to it. Otherwise, `new_arr` includes the elements `arr[previous left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[current left]`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `left` has been incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `n`, `arr`, and `right` remain unchanged. The `new_arr` list is updated based on whether `left` was equal to `right` before the increment. If they were equal, `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left - 1]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` includes `arr[previous left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[current left]`.
