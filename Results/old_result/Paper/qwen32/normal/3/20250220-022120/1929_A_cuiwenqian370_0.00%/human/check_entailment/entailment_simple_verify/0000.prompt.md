You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to strategically place the largest and smallest elements in the array to maximize the beauty.

2. **Alternating Placement**: The program then alternates between placing the largest and smallest elements in the new array. This is done by using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start from the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively. By placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the newly arranged array. This ensures that the maximum possible beauty is achieved.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as arrays with all identical elements (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), where the beauty is `0` because all differences are `0`. It also handles arrays with only two elements, where the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.

5. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and iterating through each one, storing the results and printing them at the end.

Overall, the provided code correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array and handles all the given constraints and examples appropriately. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
