The code snippet appends the element `arr[right]` to `new_arr`. Since `right` is decremented by 1 before this operation, the element being appended is the one that was originally at the index `right - 1` in `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `left` is less than `right - 1`.
- `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left]`. If `left` was equal to `right`, `new_arr` also includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it.
- `left` is incremented by 1.
- `right` is decremented by 1.

After executing the line `new_arr.append(arr[right])`:
- `new_arr` now includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it.
- `right` is decremented by 1, so it is now `right - 1`.

The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `left` is less than `right - 1`; `new_arr` includes the elements `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`; `left` is incremented by 1; `right` is decremented by 1.**
