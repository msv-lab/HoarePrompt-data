Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while left <= right:
    if left == right:
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    else:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    left += 1
    right -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, i.e., `new_arr` is `[arr[n-1]]`, and both `left` and `right` are equal to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`, `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `left` equals `right`, `left` is set to `right - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is already less than `right`. `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left]`. If `left` was equal to `right`, `new_arr` also includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it. `left` is incremented by 1. `right` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. `left` is incremented by 1. If `left` was equal to `right` before the increment, `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left - 1]` (which is the same as `arr[right]`) appended to it. Otherwise, `new_arr` includes the elements `arr[previous left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[current left]`. `right` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
