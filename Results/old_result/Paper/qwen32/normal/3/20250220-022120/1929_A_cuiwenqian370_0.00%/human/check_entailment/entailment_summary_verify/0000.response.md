Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The strategy involves sorting the array and then rearranging the elements in an alternating fashion between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

### Provided Program Analysis
1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Alternating Placement**: The program uses two pointers (`left` and `right`) to place elements alternately from the largest and smallest ends of the sorted array.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the newly arranged array.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`. It states that the function sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternately appending the largest and smallest elements. The final beauty is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this new array.

### Verification Against Test Cases
Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `3`, `[2, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Rearranged: `[3, 1, 2]` or `[3, 2, 1]` (both yield the same beauty)
   - Beauty: `|3-1| + |1-2| = 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3`, `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Rearranged: `[69, 69, 69]` (alternating placement doesn't change the array)
   - Beauty: `|69-69| + |69-69| = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5`, `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Rearranged: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
   - Beauty: `|100-43| + |43-90| + |90-54| + |54-80| = 57`
   - Expected Output: `57`
   - Program Output: `57` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4`, `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Rearranged: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Beauty: `|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2`, `[2, 1]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Rearranged: `[2, 1]`
   - Beauty: `|2-1| = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements as described in the function summary. It handles all the test cases correctly and efficiently within the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
