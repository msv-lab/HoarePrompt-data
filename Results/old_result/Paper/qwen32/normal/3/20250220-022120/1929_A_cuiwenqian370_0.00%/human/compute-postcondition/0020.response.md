To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `left <= right`. This condition must hold true for the loop to proceed.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If `left` equals `right`, `left` is set to `right - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is already less than `right`.
- `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left]`. If `left` was equal to `right`, `new_arr` also includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it.
- `left` is incremented by 1.
- `right` is decremented by 1.

From the above, we know:
- `left` is incremented by 1.
- `right` is decremented by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the increments and decrements, `left` is still less than or equal to `right`.

Let's consider the possible states:
- If `left` was less than `right` before the increment and decrement, then after incrementing `left` and decrementing `right`, `left` should still be less than or equal to `right` for the loop to continue.
- If `left` was equal to `right` before the increment and decrement, `left` would be set to `right - 1` before the increment and decrement. After the increment and decrement, `left` would be equal to `right`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the increment and decrement, `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

Given the adjustments:
- If `left` was less than `right`, we need to ensure that `left + 1 <= right - 1`, which simplifies to `left < right - 1`.
- If `left` was equal to `right`, after setting `left` to `right - 1`, we need to ensure that `left + 1 <= right - 1`, which simplifies to `right - 1 + 1 <= right - 1`, which is always true as long as `right` was initially greater than `left`.

Thus, the necessary condition is that `left` should be less than `right - 1` before the increment and decrement.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. `left` is less than `right - 1`. `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left]`. If `left` was equal to `right`, `new_arr` also includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it. `left` is incremented by 1. `right` is decremented by 1.**
