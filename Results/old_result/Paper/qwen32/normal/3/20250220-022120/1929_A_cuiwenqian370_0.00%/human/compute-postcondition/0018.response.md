Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `left` equals `right`, `left` is set to `right - 1`. Otherwise, `left` is already less than `right`. `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left]`. If `left` was equal to `right`, `new_arr` also includes the element `arr[right]` appended to it. `left` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `left` is increased by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same.
