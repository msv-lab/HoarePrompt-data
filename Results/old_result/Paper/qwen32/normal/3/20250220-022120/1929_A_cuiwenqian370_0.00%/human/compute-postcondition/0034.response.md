The code snippet `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` updates the value of `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means we are adding `abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])` to `max_beauty`.

Since the initial state specifies that `max_beauty` is already updated to `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1]) + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`, we can infer that `max_beauty` has already been incremented by two times the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the new value of `max_beauty` after executing this line will be `max_beauty` plus one more time the absolute difference between `new_arr[3]` and `new_arr[2]`.

The other variables (`new_arr`, `left`, `right`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of `n` integers where elements are arranged in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on, starting with the largest element; `left` is `n`; `right` is `n - 1`; `max_beauty` is updated to `max_beauty + 3 * abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 3.**
