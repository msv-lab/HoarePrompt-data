To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how `new_arr` is constructed.

The loop runs as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. In each iteration:
- If `left` equals `right`, it means there is one element left to process, and it is added to `new_arr`.
- Otherwise, the largest remaining element (`arr[right]`) and the smallest remaining element (`arr[left]`) are added to `new_arr` in that order.
- `left` is incremented by 1 and `right` is decremented by 1.

This process continues until all elements have been added to `new_arr`. The final `new_arr` will have the elements of `arr` arranged in an alternating largest and smallest order, starting with the largest element.

### Final Output State:
- `left` will be `right + 1` when the loop terminates, indicating that all elements have been processed.
- `new_arr` will contain the elements of `arr` in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on.

Let's formalize this:

- If `n` is even, `new_arr` will be `[arr[n-1], arr[0], arr[n-2], arr[1], ..., arr[n/2], arr[n/2 - 1]]`.
- If `n` is odd, `new_arr` will be `[arr[n-1], arr[0], arr[n-2], arr[1], ..., arr[(n+1)/2 - 1], arr[(n-1)/2]]`.

### Output State: **new_arr is a list of `n` integers where elements are arranged in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on, starting with the largest element; `left` is `n`; `right` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `new_arr` contains the elements of the original array `arr` rearranged such that the largest element comes first, followed by the smallest, then the second largest, second smallest, and so on. The variables `left` and `right` will be `n` and `n-1`, respectively, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
