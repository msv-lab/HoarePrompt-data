The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`. This means the value of `p` is updated to the new list of integers read from the input.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `t`, `qs`, and `res`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the last integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended for each element in `qs`.**
