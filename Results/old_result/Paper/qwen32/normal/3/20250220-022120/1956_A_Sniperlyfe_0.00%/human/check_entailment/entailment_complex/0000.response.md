### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given functions to determine if they meet the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a sequence `a` of positions of players to be eliminated in each round.
   - For each of the `q` values of `n` (number of players), we need to determine how many players remain after the game ends.
   - The game ends when no more players can be eliminated in a round.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the initial number of players `n` and a list `p` of positions of players to be kicked out.
   - It reduces `n` by the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - It returns the reduced value of `n`, which represents the number of players remaining at the end of the game.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of positions `k`, the number of queries `q`, the list `p` of positions, and the list `qs` of initial player counts.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of remaining players and prints the result.

4. **Correctness of the Functions**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - The logic correctly simulates the game rounds by reducing the number of players based on the positions in `p`.
     - It ensures that only players at positions less than or equal to the current number of players `n` are considered for elimination.
     - The loop continues until no more players can be eliminated, i.e., until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
     - The final value of `n` is correctly returned as the number of remaining players.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - It correctly reads and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` for each query and prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
