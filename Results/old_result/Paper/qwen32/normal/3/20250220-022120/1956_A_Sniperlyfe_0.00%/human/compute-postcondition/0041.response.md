To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`qs`**: A list of integers, with at least 2 integers.
2. **`n`**: The second integer in the list `qs`. So, `n = qs[1]`.
3. **`p`**: A new list of integers read from the input.
4. **`k` and `q`**: Two new integers read from the input.
5. **`t`**: An integer greater than 0.
6. **`res`**: A list containing two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`. So, `res = [func_1(n, p), func_1(n, p)]`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Explanation:
- The function `map(str, res)` converts each element of the list `res` to a string.
- The `' '.join(...)` method joins these string elements with a space in between.
- Therefore, the output will be a string where the two elements of `res` are converted to strings and separated by a space.

### Value of `res`:
- `res` is a list with two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- Since the exact definition and behavior of `func_1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Final Output:
The final output will be the string representation of the two results of `func_1(n, p)` separated by a space.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where [result of func_1(n, p)] is the result of the function func_1 with arguments n and p)**
