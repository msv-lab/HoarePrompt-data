To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`.

Given the initial state:
- `qs` is a new list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer.
- `n` is the first integer in the list `qs`.
- `p` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `res` is an empty list.

The function `func_1(n, p)` is called with `n` and `p` as arguments, and its result is appended to `res`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended to `res`. However, we can state that `res` will now contain one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

The other variables (`qs`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, and `t`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`qs` is a new list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is the first integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
