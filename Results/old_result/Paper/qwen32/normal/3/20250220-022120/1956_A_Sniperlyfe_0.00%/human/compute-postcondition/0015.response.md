To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the state evolves with each iteration.

The loop iterates over each element `n` in the list `qs`. For each element, it computes the result of `func_1(n, p)` and appends this result to the list `res`. This process continues until all elements in `qs` have been processed.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. After the first iteration, `res` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the first element of `qs`.
2. After the second iteration, `res` contains two elements, which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for the first two elements of `qs`.
3. After the third iteration, `res` contains three elements, which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for the first three elements of `qs`.

Following this pattern, after all iterations are complete, `res` will contain the results of `func_1(n, p)` for every element `n` in the list `qs`.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is the last integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended for each element in `qs`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `qs`, and all other variables (`n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, and `qs`) will remain in their initial states except for `n` which will be the last element processed from `qs`.
