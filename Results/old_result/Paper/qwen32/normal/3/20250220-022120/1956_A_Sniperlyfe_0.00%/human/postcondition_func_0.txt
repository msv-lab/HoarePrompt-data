The function takes an initial number of players `n` and a sorted list `p` of player positions to be kicked out. It repeatedly reduces `n` by the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. The function then returns this reduced value of `n`.
