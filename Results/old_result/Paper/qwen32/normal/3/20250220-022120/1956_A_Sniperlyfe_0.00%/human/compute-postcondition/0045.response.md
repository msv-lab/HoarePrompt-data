Output State: **`qs` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are integers in `qs`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `res` will contain a result for each integer in the list `qs`, where each result is obtained by applying the function `func_1` to each integer in `qs` with the list `p` as a parameter. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `res`, which now holds the complete set of results.
