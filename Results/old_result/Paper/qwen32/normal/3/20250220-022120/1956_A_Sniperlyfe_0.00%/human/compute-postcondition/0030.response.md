Output State: **`n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers, and `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` appended to it.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be the last integer in the list `qs`. The list `p`, integers `k` and `q`, and the value of `t` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The list `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each integer in `qs` in sequence, with `p` as the second argument to `func_1` for each call.
