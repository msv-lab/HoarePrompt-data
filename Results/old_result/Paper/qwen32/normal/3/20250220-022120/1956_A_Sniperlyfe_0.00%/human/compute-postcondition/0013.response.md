Output State: **`n` is `n_next`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it twice.**

Natural Language: The variable `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it twice, while all other variables retain their previous values.
