Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `trumps` is an empty list, `rank` is the rank of the first card, `suit` is the suit of the first card, and `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, then `answers` is a list containing one string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` each concatenated with `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list, and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`, with all other keys in `suits` set to `None`.**
