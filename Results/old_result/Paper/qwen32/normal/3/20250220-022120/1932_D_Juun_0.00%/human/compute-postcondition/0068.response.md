The only variable in the loop head is `answer`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answers` list. If there are more entries in `answers`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` contains at least one entry, so for the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must still have at least one entry left to be processed.

Since `answer` is the variable being iterated over, it will take on the next value in the `answers` list in the next iteration. Therefore, `answer` should be the next entry in `answers`.

State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains at least one entry, `suits` remains unchanged, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `answer` is the next entry in `answers`**
