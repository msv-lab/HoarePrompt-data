Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is a sorted empty list if it was empty, or a sorted list of trump cards; `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` must contain at least one element, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `trumps` must contain at least one element, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `trumps` must contain at least one element, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
