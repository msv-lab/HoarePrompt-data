Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a space-separated list of 2n distinct cards where each card is represented by a two-character string. The first character of each card is a rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character is a suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S'). The variable `trump` is assigned the value of the input character, which is the trump suit. The variable `trumps` is an empty list. The variable `answers` is an empty list.**
