Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains all its entries, `suits` remains unchanged, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `answer` is the last entry in `answers`.**

Natural language explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` is still an empty list as it was not modified within the loop. The `answers` list has been fully traversed, meaning all its entries have been printed and `answer` will hold the last entry from `answers`. The variables `suits`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
