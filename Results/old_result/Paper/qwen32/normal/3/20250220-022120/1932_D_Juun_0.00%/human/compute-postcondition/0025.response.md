The only object in the loop head is the variable `card`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input sequence. At the end of the last iteration, `card` was the last card processed from the input sequence. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another card in the input sequence to be processed.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `card` to reflect the next card in the input sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is the next card in the input sequence, `rank` is the first element of the new `card`, `suit` is the second element of the new `card`, `trumps` is updated based on the new `rank` and `suit`, `answers` is updated based on the new `rank` and `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is updated based on the new `rank` and `suit`.**
