Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is the next card in the input sequence, `rank` is the first element of the new `card`, `suit` is the second element of the new `card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` is updated to include the new `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is updated with a new entry `' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])])` and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, it is updated to `rank`. `answers` is updated based on the new `rank` and `suit` in both cases.**
