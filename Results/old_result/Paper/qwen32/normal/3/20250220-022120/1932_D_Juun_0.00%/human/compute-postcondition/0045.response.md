Postcondition: **`trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards except the last one, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one new entry formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `suits` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `rank` remains `None` if it was `None` initially. If `rank` is `None`, `suit` and `rank` are updated to the next key-value pair in the `suits` dictionary.**
