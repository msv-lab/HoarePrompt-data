The code snippet sorts the `trumps` list. Given the initial state, `trumps` is either empty or contains trump cards that need to be sorted. After sorting, the `trumps` list will be in ascending order.

Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted empty list if it was empty, or a sorted list of trump cards; `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**
