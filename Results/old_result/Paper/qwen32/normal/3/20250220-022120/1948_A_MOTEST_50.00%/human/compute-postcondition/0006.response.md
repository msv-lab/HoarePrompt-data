The `print('NO')` statement will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s` as these variables are not used in the print statement.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. The variable `t` is mentioned to be greater than 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
2. The variable `n` is mentioned to be an integer with the current value of 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
3. The variable `s` is mentioned to be the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', but it is not used in the print statement.

Since the print statement directly contains the string 'NO', the output will be 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
