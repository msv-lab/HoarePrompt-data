Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is 1, no additional changes occur. If `n` is even and not equal to 1, `ans` is a string of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`. If `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 7, `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', `x` is 4, and `j` is 3.**
