The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 0, `s[x]` would be the character 'A'. Therefore, 'A' repeated twice is 'AA', which is appended to `ans`, making `ans` now equal to 'AA'. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0**.
