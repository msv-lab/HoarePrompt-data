The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than `i + 1`
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1
- `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `ans` is 'AA'
- `x` is 1
- `j` is 1

The character at index `x` (which is 1) in the string `s` is 'B'. Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in 'BB'. This is then appended to `ans`, changing `ans` from 'AA' to 'AABB'.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
