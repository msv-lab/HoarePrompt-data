The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is initialized to 0, `s[0]` is 'A'. Therefore, 'A' repeated twice is 'AA', which is appended to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0**.
