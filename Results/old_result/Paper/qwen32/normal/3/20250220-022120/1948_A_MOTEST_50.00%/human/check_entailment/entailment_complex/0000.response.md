### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, the goal is to determine if a string of uppercase Latin letters can be constructed such that there are exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters where each character appears at least twice consecutively or is part of a pair.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of different uppercase letters. For example, if `n` is 6, the string could be "AABBCC" (where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are special characters).
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then constructs the rest of the string by repeating pairs of different uppercase letters. For example, if `n` is 5, the string could be "AAABBCC" (where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are special characters).

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if a suitable string exists, or "NO" if it does not.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 6`**
  - Expected output: "YES" and a string with 6 special characters, e.g., "AAABAACC".
  - Program output: "YES" and "AABBCC" (or any other valid string with 6 special characters).

- **Test Case 2: `n = 1`**
  - Expected output: "NO".
  - Program output: "NO".

- **Test Case 3: `n = 2`**
  - Expected output: "YES" and a string with 2 special characters, e.g., "MM".
  - Program output: "YES" and "MM".

The program correctly handles all these test cases and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the example test cases.

**Correctness: True**
