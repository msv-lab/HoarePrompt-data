Output State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`; `mid` is the integer value calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` is now `mid`.**

In simple terms, the value of `h` has been updated to `mid`, while the other variables (`l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged. The condition `l < h - 1` is still valid after the update.
