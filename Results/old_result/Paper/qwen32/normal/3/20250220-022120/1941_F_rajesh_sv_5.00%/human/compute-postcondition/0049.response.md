To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `l < h` remains true after the current iteration.

From the provided information:
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` must be at least `mid + 2`.
- Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that after the update, `l` is still less than `h`.

Let's consider the two cases:
1. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` must be at least `mid + 2`. To ensure `l < h`, `h` must be at least `mid + 2`.
2. If `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` is updated to `mid`. To ensure `l < h`, `l` must be less than `mid`.

Since `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid` is always between `l` and `h` (inclusive of `l` but exclusive of `h`). Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `h` is at least `l + 1`.

Given the above, the state should be adjusted such that `h` is at least `l + 1`.

State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`**
