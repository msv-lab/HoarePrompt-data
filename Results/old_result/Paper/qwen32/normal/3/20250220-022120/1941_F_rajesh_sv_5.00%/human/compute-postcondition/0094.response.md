Postcondition: **`l` is the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f`, `h` is the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l == h`, `f` is the next value in `F`, and `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`**
