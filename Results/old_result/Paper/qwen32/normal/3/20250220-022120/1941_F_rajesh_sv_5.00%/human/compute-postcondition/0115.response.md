To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` based on the initial state provided.

### Given:
- **Initial State:** `ans`
- **Code Snippet:** `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))`

### Analysis:
1. **`ans`:** The value of `ans` is provided in the initial state, but its specific value is not mentioned. Therefore, we can only refer to it as `ans`.
2. **`next_max_diff`:** This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we can only refer to it as `next_max_diff`.

### Output Explanation:
The `print` statement will output the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`. Since the specific values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the value of ans and next_max_diff is the value of next_max_diff)**
