Output State: **`l` is updated to `mid + 1`; `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`; `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l == h`; `f` is the next value in `F`; `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is now `mid + 1`. The value of `h` remains the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l`, or it remains equal to `mid`. The value of `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. The value of `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l` equals `h`. The value of `f` is updated to the next value in `F`. The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is now true.
