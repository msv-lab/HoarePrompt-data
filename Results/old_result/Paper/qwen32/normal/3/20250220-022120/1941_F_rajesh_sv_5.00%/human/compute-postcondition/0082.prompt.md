Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is the index found by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is the index found by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `D` must have at least two elements with `left - f` less than some element in `D` and `right - f` greater than some element in `D`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` while `h` and `mid` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` while `l` and `mid` remain unchanged. `D` must have at least two elements with `left - f` less than some element in `D` and `right - f` greater than some element in `D`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, while `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`, and `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
