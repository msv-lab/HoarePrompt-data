n, m, and k are integers where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. A is a list of n integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9). D is a list of m integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9). F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).
