Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 2, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`. If `diff` (which is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`) is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]` and `index` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains unchanged and `index` is None. Additionally, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
