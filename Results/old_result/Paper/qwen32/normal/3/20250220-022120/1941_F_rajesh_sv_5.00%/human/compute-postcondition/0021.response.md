Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`. If `diff` (which is `A[4] - A[3]`) is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 4. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.**
