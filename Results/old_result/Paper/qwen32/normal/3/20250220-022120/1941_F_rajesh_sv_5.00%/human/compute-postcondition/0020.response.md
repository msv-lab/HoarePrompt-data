Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[4] - A[3]` if `diff` (which is `A[4] - A[3]`) is greater than `next_max_diff`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found or None, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**
