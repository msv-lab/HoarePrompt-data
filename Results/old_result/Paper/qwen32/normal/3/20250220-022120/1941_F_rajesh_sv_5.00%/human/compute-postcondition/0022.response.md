The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust those variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is at least 4. According to the `for` loop statement, `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Since `i` is currently 4, the next value for `i` should be 5 for the loop to execute again. The value of `n` remains the same because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 5, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`. If `diff` (which is `A[4] - A[3]`) is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 4. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`**.
