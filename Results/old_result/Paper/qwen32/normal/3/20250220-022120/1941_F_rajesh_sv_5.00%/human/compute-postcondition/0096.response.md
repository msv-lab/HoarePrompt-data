Postcondition: **`l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f`. `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l == h`. `f` is the next value in `F`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` if `l` was updated, otherwise `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.**
