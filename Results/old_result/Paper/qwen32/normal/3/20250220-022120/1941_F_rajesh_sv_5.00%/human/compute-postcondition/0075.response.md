Postcondition: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` while `h` and `mid` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` while `l` and `mid` remain unchanged. `D` must have at least two elements with `left - f` less than some element in `D` and `right - f` greater than some element in `D`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
