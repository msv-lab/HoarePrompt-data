Output State: **`l` is the index found by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is `mid`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `D` must have at least two elements, `left - f` must be less than some element in `D`, and `right - f` must be greater than some element in `D`. Additionally, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `h` is now updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
