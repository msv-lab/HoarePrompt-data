The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over the string `encoded`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `encoded` and the current value of `char`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was `char_next`, which means that `char_next` was the last character processed in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in `encoded` to process.

Since `char` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the string `encoded`. Therefore, we need to determine what that next character is.

Let's denote the next character in the string `encoded` after `char_next` as `char_next_next`. The state at the start of the next iteration will then be:

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `char` appended to it if `char` exists in `mapping`; otherwise, `decoded` contains `chr(c)` appended to it, `char` is `char_next_next`**.
