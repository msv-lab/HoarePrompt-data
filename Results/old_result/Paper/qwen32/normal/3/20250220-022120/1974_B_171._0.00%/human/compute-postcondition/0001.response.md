The code snippet initializes an empty list named `decoded`. The initial state of `encoded` and `mapping` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.**
