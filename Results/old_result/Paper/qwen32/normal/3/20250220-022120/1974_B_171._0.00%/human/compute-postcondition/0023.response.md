The code snippet `decoded.append(mapping[char])` appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the `decoded` list. Given the initial state, `mapping` can either be an empty dictionary or contain one entry `{'a': char}`. If `mapping` contains the entry `{'a': char}`, then `mapping[char]` will raise a `KeyError` unless `char` is 'a'. However, if `mapping` is empty, `mapping[char]` will also raise a `KeyError`.

Since the problem statement does not specify that `char` can be 'a' or any other character, and considering that if `char` is not 'a' and `mapping` is not empty, the code would raise an error, we assume the most straightforward case where `char` could be 'a' and `mapping` contains `{'a': char}`. Therefore, `mapping[char]` will be `char` itself if `char` is 'a', and it will raise a `KeyError` otherwise.

However, given the precondition that `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` exists in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` does not exist in `mapping`, we can infer that the code is expected to run without error, implying `char` must be 'a' and `mapping` must be `{'a': char}`.

Thus, `decoded.append(mapping[char])` will append `char` to `decoded`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `char` appended to it, `char` is `char_next`.**
