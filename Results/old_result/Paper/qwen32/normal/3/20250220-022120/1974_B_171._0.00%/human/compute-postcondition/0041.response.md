The code appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the `decoded` list. Given the initial state, if `mapping` contains the entry `{'a': char}`, then `mapping[char]` will be `char`. If `mapping` is empty, `mapping[char]` will raise a `KeyError`, but based on the problem statement, we assume `char` exists in `mapping`.

Since `char` is `char_next_next` and `mapping` contains `{'a': char}`, the value of `mapping[char]` is `char`. Therefore, `decoded` will have `char` appended to it.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `char` appended to it, `char` is `char_next_next`.**
