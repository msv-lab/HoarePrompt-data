You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string as described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the way the mapping from encoded characters to original characters is constructed. The program does not accurately determine the correct mapping based on the distinct characters of the original string `s` sorted in alphabetical order and their symmetric replacements.

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

Here's why this code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**: The code attempts to construct a mapping by assigning the first available unused character from 'a' to 'z' to each new character in the encoded string. This does not follow the described algorithm where characters are mapped based on their symmetric positions in the sorted distinct characters of the original string.

2. **No Symmetric Character Replacement**: The code does not compute the string `r` (distinct characters of the original string sorted alphabetically) and does not perform the symmetric character replacement as described in the problem statement.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Example:**

Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`.

According to the problem statement, the decoding should work as follows:

1. Determine `r` from the encoded string by first finding the distinct characters and sorting them alphabetically.
2. Map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

For the given encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`, the distinct characters in alphabetical order would be `r = "cdefors"`. The symmetric mapping would be:

- 's' -> 'c'
- 'e' -> 'd'
- 'r' -> 'o'
- 'o' -> 'f'
- 'f' -> 'e'
- 'd' -> 'r'
- 'c' -> 's'

Using this mapping, the decoded string should be `s = "codeforces"`.

However, the provided code does not perform this mapping correctly and would likely produce an incorrect result.

**Counterexample:**

For the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`, the provided code might produce something like `"codeforces"` but not necessarily due to the incorrect mapping logic. However, for other strings, it will definitely produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
