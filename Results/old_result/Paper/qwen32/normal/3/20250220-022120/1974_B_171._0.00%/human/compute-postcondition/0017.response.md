Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with an entry `mapping['b'] = char`, `decoded` is a list that may have been updated, `c` is 98 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program execution will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
