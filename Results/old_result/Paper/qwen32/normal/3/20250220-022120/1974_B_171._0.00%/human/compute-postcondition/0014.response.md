Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. If `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated with an additional key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`, `decoded` remains an empty list, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` and `decoded` remain unchanged, and `c` is incremented by 1.**
