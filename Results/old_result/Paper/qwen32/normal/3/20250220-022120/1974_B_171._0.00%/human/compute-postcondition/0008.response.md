The code snippet adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is the character represented by `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. 

Given the Initial State:
- `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
- `decoded` is an empty list.
- `char` is not in `mapping`.
- The character represented by `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.

After executing the code snippet, the `mapping` dictionary will no longer be empty; it will contain the new key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`. The other variables (`encoded`, `decoded`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`; `decoded` is an empty list; `char` is not in `mapping`.**
