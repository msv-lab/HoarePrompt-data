The `break` statement does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state. It simply exits the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded` with an additional entry `chr(c): char_next_next`, `decoded` is a list of characters, `char` is `char_next_next`, `c` is `c + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
