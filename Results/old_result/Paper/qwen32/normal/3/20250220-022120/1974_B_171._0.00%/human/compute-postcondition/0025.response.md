Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `char` is `char_next`, `c` is 97, and `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`**
