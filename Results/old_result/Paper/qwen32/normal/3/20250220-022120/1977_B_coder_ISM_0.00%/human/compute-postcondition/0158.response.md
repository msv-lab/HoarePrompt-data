The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. If `i` is less than `length`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `length` must be greater than `i`. 

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be increased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The condition `length` must be greater than `i` should still hold true for the loop to execute again.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1` and `length` must still be greater than `x + 1`.

State: **`length` must be greater than `i + 1`**
