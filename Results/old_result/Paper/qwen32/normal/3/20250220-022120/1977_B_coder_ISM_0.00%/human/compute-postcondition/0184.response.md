The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(*s)
```

Given the initial state, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either '1' or '0'. These elements represent the binary digits of the input integer `x`, starting from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. The `*s` in the `print` statement unpacks the list `s` and prints each element separated by a space.

Since the exact values of the elements in `s` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list's contents. The `*s` syntax means that each element of the list `s` will be printed individually, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of 30 binary digits ('1's and '0's) separated by spaces.

Output: **30 binary digits ('1's and '0's) separated by spaces (where each digit represents a binary digit of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit)**
