The `print(*s)` statement will unpack the list `s` and print its elements separated by spaces. According to the initial state, the list `s` has no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs, but the specific elements of `s` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the print output in terms of the contents of `s`.

Output: **the elements of list `s` separated by spaces (where `s` is a list with no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs)**
