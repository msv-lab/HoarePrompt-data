Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters, each being either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30.**

In simple terms, after all 30 iterations of the loop, the list `s` will contain 30 characters. Each character in the list `s` corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of the integer `x`. If a bit in `x` is set (i.e., it is 1), the corresponding character in `s` will be `'1'`. If a bit in `x` is not set (i.e., it is 0), the corresponding character in `s` will be `'0'`. The other variables `t` and `length` remain unchanged.
