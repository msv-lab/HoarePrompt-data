Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `s` has transformed such that any sequence of consecutive '1's has the first '1' replaced by '-1' and subsequent '1's in that sequence are replaced by '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is not 1, and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` remains '0'. If `flag` is not 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', then `s[29]` is explicitly set to '0', and an additional '1' is appended to the list, `length` is incremented by 1, and `flag` remains non-zero. If `flag` is 0, no further changes are made to `s`, `length`, or `flag`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 29. The variable `x` is assigned the value from user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `length` must be greater than 1. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, there is no change to `s[i]` or `s[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `length` must be greater than `i`. If `s[i]` is `'-1'` and `s[i - 1]` is `'1'`, then `s` has its `i`-th character changed to `'0'` and its `(i - 1)`-th character changed to `'-1'`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `length` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is `'0'` and `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`, then the condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` is not met, so no changes are made to `s[i]` or `s[i - 1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s[i]` or `s[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
