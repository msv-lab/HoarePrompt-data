Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of 30 elements where consecutive '1's pairs are replaced by '-1' and '0's following '-1' are flipped to '1', except if `flag` is not 0 and `s[29]` is '0', in which case `s` becomes a list of 31 elements with the first 30 elements following the same rule and the 31st element being '0'. `flag` is 1 if `flag` was initially 0 and `s[29]` was '0'; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'; otherwise, `length` is 31. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration. `x` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements following the specified rules. If `s[1]` is `'0'` and `s[0]` is `'-1'`, `flag` is set to 1 if it was initially 0 and `s[29]` was `'0'`; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not `'0'`; otherwise, `length` is 31. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration. `x` is the input integer. `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements, `flag` is 0 or 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 2. If `s[1]` is `'-1'` and `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `s[2]` is `'0'`. Otherwise, the state of `s` remains as per the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements, `flag` is 0 or 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 3. If the element at index 2 of `s` is '-1' and the element at index 3 of `s` is '0', then the element at index 3 of `s` is set to '0'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s` related to the if condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
