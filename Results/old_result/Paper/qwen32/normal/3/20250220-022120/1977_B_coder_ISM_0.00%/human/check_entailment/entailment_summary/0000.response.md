### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the given problem by transforming the binary representation of a positive integer `x` into an array that meets the specified conditions. Let's break down the program and evaluate its correctness based on the problem requirements.

#### Program Breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.
   - It iterates over the range of 30 (since `x < 2^30`), checking if the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true). If the bit is set, it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Transformation Rules:**
   - The program then applies a series of transformations to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements (either `'1'` or `'-1'`) exist.
   - It uses a flag to track when a `'1'` has been encountered and needs to be replaced with `'-1'` if the next bit is also `'1'`.
   - If a `'1'` is followed by another `'1'`, the first `'1'` is replaced with `'-1'`, and the flag is set.
   - If a `'1'` is followed by `'0'`, the `'0'` is replaced with `'1'` if the flag is set, effectively carrying over the `'1'` from the previous position.
   - If the flag is still set after processing the 29th bit and the 30th bit is `'0'`, it replaces the 30th bit with `'1'`.
   - If the flag is set and the 30th bit is also `'1'`, it sets the 30th bit to `'0'` and appends `'1'` to the list, increasing the length of the array.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program checks for any consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs and swaps them to ensure no such pairs exist.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the length of the transformed array and the array itself.

#### Evaluation:

- **Binary Transformation:**
  - The program correctly converts `x` into its binary representation.
  - It ensures that no consecutive non-zero elements exist by replacing `'1'` with `'-1'` when necessary and adjusting subsequent bits accordingly.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles small values of `x` (e.g., `1`) correctly by outputting a single-element array.
  - It also handles larger values of `x` (e.g., `14`, `24`, `15`, etc.) by applying the transformation rules appropriately.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the problem's requirements, providing the length of the array followed by the array itself.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It adheres to the constraints and ensures that the output array meets all the specified conditions.

**Correctness: True**
