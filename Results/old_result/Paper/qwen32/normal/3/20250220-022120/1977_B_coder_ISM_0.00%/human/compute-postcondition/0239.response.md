Postcondition: **`s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements, `flag` is 0 or 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 2. If `s[1]` is `'-1'` and `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `s[2]` is `'0'`. Otherwise, the state of `s` remains as per the precondition.**
