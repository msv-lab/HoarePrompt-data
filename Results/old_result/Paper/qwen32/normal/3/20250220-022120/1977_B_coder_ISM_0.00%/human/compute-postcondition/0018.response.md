Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either `['1', '1']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or `['0', '1']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is 30. If the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, `s` ends with `['1', '1']`. Otherwise, `s` ends with `['0', '1']`.**
