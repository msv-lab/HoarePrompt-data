Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, and `s[28]` is '1' if `flag` was 1 and `s[28]` was '0'. Otherwise, `s[28]` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The variable `flag` is 0 if `s[28]` was '0' and `flag` was 1; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is 28.**
