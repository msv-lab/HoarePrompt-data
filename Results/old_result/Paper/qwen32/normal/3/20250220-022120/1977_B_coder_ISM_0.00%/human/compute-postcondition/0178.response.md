Postcondition: **The list `s` is either `['1', '1']`, `['0', '1']`, `['1', '0']`, or `['0', '0']` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 or 0, respectively. `flag` remains unchanged, `length` is 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
