Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters where `s[i]` is `'-1'` and `s[i + 1]` is `'1'`, and all other elements are either `'1'` or `'0'`; `flag` is 1; `length` is 30.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `flag` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
