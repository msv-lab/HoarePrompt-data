Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either `['1']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or `['0']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set, and now `s` has an additional element `'1'` at the end; `length` is 30; `i` is 29**.

In natural language: The list `s` now has an additional element `'1'` appended to it, while all other variables retain their initial values.
