Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined and used. The function `func_1` checks if the total price calculated for a given `k` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition to determine the maximum profit.

The main issue is that `func_1` does not actually calculate the profit correctly. It simply adds `k * b` and `(n - k) * a` and checks if it is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This does not give the actual profit, and it does not help in finding the maximum profit.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the profit for a given `k`. It simply adds `k * b` and `(n - k) * a` and checks if it is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This does not give the actual profit.

2. **Binary Search Misuse**:
   - The binary search is used to find the maximum `k` for which `func_1` returns `True`. However, `func_1` does not correctly determine the profit, so the binary search does not find the correct `k` that maximizes the profit.

3. **No Profit Calculation**:
   - The program does not actually calculate the profit for each `k` and then find the maximum profit. Instead, it incorrectly checks a condition that does not relate to the profit.

To fix the program, we need to calculate the profit for each possible `k` and find the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = (b - k + 1) * k + a * (n - k) if b - k + 1 > 0 else a * n
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
        print(max_profit)
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the profit for each possible `k` and keep track of the maximum profit. This ensures that we find the correct maximum profit for each test case.
