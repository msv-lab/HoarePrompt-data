The code snippet initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The other variables (`k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `ans` is 0.**
