Precondition: **k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.**

Note: The function definition provided in the problem statement seems incorrect as per the problem description. The correct function definition should take four parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, and should not include `k` as an input parameter since `k` is the variable Bob needs to determine to maximize his profit. The correct function definition should be:
```
def func_1(n, a, b):
```
