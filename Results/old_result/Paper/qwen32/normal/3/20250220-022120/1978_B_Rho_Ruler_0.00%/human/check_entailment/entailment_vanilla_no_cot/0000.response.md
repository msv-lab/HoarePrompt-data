Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns. The function `func_1` does not calculate the actual profit for a given `k` and compare it with other possible profits. Instead, it checks a condition that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the total profit for each possible value of `k` and find the maximum profit among them. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            # Calculate the profit for this k
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) + a * (n - k)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This program iterates over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and calculates the profit for each `k`. It then keeps track of the maximum profit found. This ensures that we find the optimal `k` that maximizes Bob's profit.
