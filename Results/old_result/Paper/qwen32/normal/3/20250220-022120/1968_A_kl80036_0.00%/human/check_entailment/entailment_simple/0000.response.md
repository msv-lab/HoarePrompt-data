### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The program, however, simply sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \) for each test case and prints it. This approach does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

Let's analyze why this is incorrect with a counterexample:

- Consider \( x = 10 \):
  - The program sets \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \).
  - \(\gcd(10, 5) = 5\), so \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\).
  - However, if we try \( y = 9 \):
    - \(\gcd(10, 9) = 1\), so \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10\).
  - If we try \( y = 6 \):
    - \(\gcd(10, 6) = 2\), so \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 8\).
  - The maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \( x = 10 \) is indeed 10, but both \( y = 5 \) and \( y = 9 \) achieve this maximum, and the program only finds \( y = 5 \).

- Another example, \( x = 21 \):
  - The program sets \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \).
  - \(\gcd(21, 10) = 1\), so \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 11\).
  - However, if we try \( y = 18 \):
    - \(\gcd(21, 18) = 3\), so \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 21\).
  - The maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \( x = 21 \) is 21, which is achieved when \( y = 18 \), and the program does not find this.

Thus, the program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

### Correctness: **False**
