Output State: **i is t-1, x is the last input integer, y is the integer division of the last input integer by 2.**

In natural language, this means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` (since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, reaching `t-1` for the `t`th iteration). The variable `x` will hold the value of the last input integer provided for the loop, and `y` will be the result of integer division of that last `x` by 2. All other variables that are part of the initial state but not modified by the loop (like `t` itself) remain unchanged.
