To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `eta_ln` is equal to 1.
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`.

The code snippet:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `eta_ln` is 1, which means the list `eta` has exactly one element.
- `rho` is defined as `q[eta[0]]`, but this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

The `print` statement calculates and prints the value of `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. However, the value of `n` is not mentioned in the initial state. Since `n` is not defined or given any explicit value, we cannot compute the exact numerical output. 

But based on the structure of the problem, we can infer that the output will be the result of this formula for whatever value `n` takes. The formula `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` is commonly used to calculate the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time (i.e., `C(n, 3)`).

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, the output can be described as the result of this formula for the given `n`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is an integer)**
