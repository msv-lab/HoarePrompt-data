The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers, where `q[w[n-1]]` is incremented by 1; `j` is `n`**
