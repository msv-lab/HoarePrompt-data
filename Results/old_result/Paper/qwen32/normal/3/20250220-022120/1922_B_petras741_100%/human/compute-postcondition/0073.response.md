The provided code snippet calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. The list `eta` contains all indices `j` from `0` to `n` for which the corresponding element in the list `q` is greater than `0`.

Based on the initial state, `eta` is already defined as a list of indices where `q[j] > 0`. Therefore, the only change here is the introduction of the variable `eta_ln`, which is the length of `eta`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` remains greater than or equal to 1; `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` remains an empty list; `w` remains a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` remains `i + 1`; `q` remains a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; `eta` will contain all indices `j` (from `0` to `n`) for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.**
