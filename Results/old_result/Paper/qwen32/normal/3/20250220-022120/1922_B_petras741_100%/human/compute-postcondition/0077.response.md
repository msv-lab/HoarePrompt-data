Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` remains greater than or equal to 1; `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` remains an empty list; `w` remains a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` remains `i + 1`; `q` remains a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; `eta` contains all indices `j` (from `0` to `n`) for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1; `rho` is assigned the value of `q[eta[0]]`.**
