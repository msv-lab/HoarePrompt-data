The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and stores them in the list `w`. This means that `w` will now hold the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
