The given code snippet appends the variable `j` to the list `eta`. Since the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, we will keep it as `j` in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers; `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` is a list containing the integer `j`.**
