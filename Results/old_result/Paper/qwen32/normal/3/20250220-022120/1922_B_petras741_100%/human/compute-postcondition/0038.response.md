Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is `rho + q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is `j + 1`**

The value of `res` has been updated to include an additional term `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. All other variables remain as they were initially described.
