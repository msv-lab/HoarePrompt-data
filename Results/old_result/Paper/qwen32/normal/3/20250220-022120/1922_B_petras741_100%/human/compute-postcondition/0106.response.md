Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1, and `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains the newly input integer that is at least 1, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n`, `buffer` remains an empty list, `w` remains the list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` remains `i + 1`, `q` is updated such that the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, and `w[j]` (where `j` is 2) are each incremented by 1, and `j` remains 2.
