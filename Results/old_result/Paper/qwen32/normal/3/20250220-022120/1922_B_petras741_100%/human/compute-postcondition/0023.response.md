The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is 5, `eta` will now contain the integer 4 (if `q[4]` is greater than 0) and the integer 5.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers; `eta` is a list containing the integers 4 and 5 if `q[4]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing the integer 5; `j` is 5.**
