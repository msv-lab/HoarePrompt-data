Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values; `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values, `j` is the first element in `pl`. If the count of `j` in `d` is at least 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values, `j` is the second element in `pl`. If `d[j] >= 3`, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values, `j` is the third element in `pl`. If `d[j] >= 3`, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
