Postcondition: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i`, and if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`; otherwise, the value associated with key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` and `d` remain unchanged.**
