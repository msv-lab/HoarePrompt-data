The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is [], `d` is a dictionary, and `d.get(i)` is not `None`. The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`**.
