The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that the list `pl` will now contain all its previous elements plus the new element `i` at the end. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that now contains `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None` before the if-else block, or the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
