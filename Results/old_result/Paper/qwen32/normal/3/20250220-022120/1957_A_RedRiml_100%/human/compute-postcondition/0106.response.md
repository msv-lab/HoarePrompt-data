Postcondition: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` and includes `i_next` and `i_next_next` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (if `i` existed, it is now `d[i] + 1`; if `i` did not exist, it is now 1); other key-value pairs in `d` are unchanged, and `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. `i` is `i_next_next`.**
