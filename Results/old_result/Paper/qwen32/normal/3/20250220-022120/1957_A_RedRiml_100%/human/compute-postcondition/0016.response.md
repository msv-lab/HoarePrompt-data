The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1. This means that if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is overwritten to 1. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is the dictionary `d` because the value associated with the key `i` is set to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has the value 1; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
