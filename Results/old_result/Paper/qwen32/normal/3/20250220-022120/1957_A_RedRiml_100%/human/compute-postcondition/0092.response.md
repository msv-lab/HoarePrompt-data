Postcondition: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list that does not contain `i`, `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` becomes `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
