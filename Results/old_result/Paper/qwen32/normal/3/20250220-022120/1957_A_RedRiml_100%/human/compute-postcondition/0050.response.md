The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given that `d.get(i)` is not `None`, it means that the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d` and has a value.

Output State: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an updated dictionary where the value associated with key `i` is incremented by 1.**
