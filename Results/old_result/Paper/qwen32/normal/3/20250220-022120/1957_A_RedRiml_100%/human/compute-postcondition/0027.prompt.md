Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` is updated to have the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None` before the if-else block, or the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`; `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None` before the if-else block, or the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
