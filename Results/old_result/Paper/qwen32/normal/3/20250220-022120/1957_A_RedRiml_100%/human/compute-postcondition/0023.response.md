The given code snippet is `d[i] += 1`. This line increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. If the key `i` does not exist in the dictionary `d`, this line will raise a `KeyError`. However, based on the initial state provided, it is mentioned that if `d.get(i)` was `None` before the if-else block, the key `i` is added to `d` with a value of 1. Therefore, we can assume that the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d` with some value.

Given this, the value of `d[i]` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
