Output State: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `w` remains as 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `ln` remains as an input integer. The new variable `palka` is created and is assigned a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
