Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element; `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for the current key `j` in `d`. `j` is the next element in `pl`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged and `j` is still the next element in `pl`.**
