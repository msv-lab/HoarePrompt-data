The code snippet only initializes an empty dictionary `d`. The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.**
