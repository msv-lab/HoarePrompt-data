To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust only the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `possible` is determined based on the conditions provided.

Since `i` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations the loop will perform.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1; `possible` is undetermined (will be recalculated in the loop body)**

Note: The value of `possible` is recalculated in each iteration based on the conditions provided, so it is not adjusted here.
