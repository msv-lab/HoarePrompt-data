Postcondition: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `possible` retains its previous value. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or if `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**
