Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, `i` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `possible` has been explicitly set to `True` by the code, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
