Output State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain as they were before the `continue` statement, except that the loop control will move to the next iteration.
