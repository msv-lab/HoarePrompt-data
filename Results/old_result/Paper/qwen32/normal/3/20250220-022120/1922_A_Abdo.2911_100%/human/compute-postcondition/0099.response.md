Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

The value of `possible` has been changed to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
