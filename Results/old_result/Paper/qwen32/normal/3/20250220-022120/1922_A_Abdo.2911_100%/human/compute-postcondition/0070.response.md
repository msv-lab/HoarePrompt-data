The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. In this case, the values of `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are all mentioned as part of the initial state and none of them are directly modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state except that `i` has already been incremented by 1 as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, `i` is `i + 1`**
