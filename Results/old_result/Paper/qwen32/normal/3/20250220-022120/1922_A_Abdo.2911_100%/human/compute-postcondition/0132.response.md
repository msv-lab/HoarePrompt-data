The given initial state describes the conditions and values of certain variables before the print statement is executed. Specifically, it states that `possible` is `False`, `t` remains at least 1, `n` is the input integer, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input strings. However, none of these variables are used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or conditions that affect what is printed; it is a static string.

Output: **NO**
