Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns the result of some computation or comparison performed on these strings for each test case.**
