Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`. `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values.**
