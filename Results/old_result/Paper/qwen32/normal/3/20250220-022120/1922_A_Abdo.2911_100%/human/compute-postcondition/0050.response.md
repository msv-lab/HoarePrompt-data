The code snippet assigns the stripped input value to the variable `c`. The other variables (`possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`possible` is a boolean, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value.**
