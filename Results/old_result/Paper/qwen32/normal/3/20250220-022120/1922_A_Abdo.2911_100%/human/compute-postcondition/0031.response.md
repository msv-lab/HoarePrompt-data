The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `possible` remains undetermined. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `possible` remains undetermined.**
