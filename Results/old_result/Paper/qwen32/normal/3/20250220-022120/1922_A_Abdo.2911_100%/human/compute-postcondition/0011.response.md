Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `possible` is True; `i` is 0; the current character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the current character at index `i` in `b`; the current character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the current character at index `i` in `a`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `possible` has been set to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
