Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, then `possible` is set to True if the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `a`. Otherwise, `possible` remains False. If the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, then `possible` is set to True if the character at index `i` in `c` is neither equal to the character at index `i` in `a` nor the character at index `i` in `b`. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**
