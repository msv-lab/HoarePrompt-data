Postcondition: **`possible` is `False` if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, otherwise `possible` is `True`. `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input values, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `possible` becomes `True`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
