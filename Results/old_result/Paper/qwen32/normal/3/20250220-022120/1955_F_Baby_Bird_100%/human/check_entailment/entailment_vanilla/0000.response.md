Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game's winning condition depends on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve's task is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

Here are the key points:
- XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across the numbers is even.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are `01`, `10`, `11`, and `100` respectively.
- Eve needs to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of `1`s in each bit position as often as possible.

### Strategy for Eve

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve needs to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as many times as possible. This can be achieved by:
- Removing numbers in pairs that cancel each other out in terms of their binary representation.
- Ensuring that the count of `1`s in each bit position among the remaining numbers is even.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
2. It computes a sum for each test case using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right) + p_i \% 2 \times (i < 3)
   \]
   where \( p_i \) is the count of the \( i \)-th type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), and \( i \) is the index (0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4).
3. It then divides this sum by 3 and prints the result.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula

- For numbers 1, 2, and 3 (indices 0, 1, 2):
  - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right) \) counts the number of pairs of these numbers, which can be removed to ensure even counts in the bitwise representation.
  - \( p_i \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 if there is an odd count of these numbers, allowing for a potential zero XOR if paired with another number.
- For number 4 (index 3):
  - Since 4 is `100` in binary, pairs of 4 do not affect the lower two bits. Thus, only the integer division part is considered.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by calculating the optimal removal strategy based on the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Correctness: **True**
