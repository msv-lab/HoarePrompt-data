You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these counts and outputs the integer division of this sum by 3, with each result on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game's winning condition depends on the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve's task is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by removing numbers optimally.

Here are the key points:
- XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across the numbers is even.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are `01`, `10`, `11`, and `100` respectively.
- Eve needs to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of `1`s in each bit position as often as possible.

### Strategy for Eve

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve needs to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as many times as possible. This can be achieved by:
- Removing numbers in pairs that cancel each other out in terms of their binary representation.
- Ensuring that the count of `1`s in each bit position among the remaining numbers is even.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
2. It computes a sum for each test case using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right) + p_i \% 2 \times (i < 3)
   \]
   where \( p_i \) is the count of the \( i \)-th type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), and \( i \) is the index (0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4).
3. It then divides this sum by 3 and prints the result.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula

- For numbers 1, 2, and 3 (indices 0, 1, 2):
  - \( 3 \times \left(\frac{p_i}{2}\right) \) counts the number of pairs of these numbers, which can be removed to ensure even counts in the bitwise representation.
  - \( p_i \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 if there is an odd count of these numbers, allowing for a potential zero XOR if paired with another number.
- For number 4 (index 3):
  - Since 4 is `100` in binary, pairs of 4 do not affect the lower two bits. Thus, only the integer division part is considered.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by calculating the optimal removal strategy based on the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
