Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which specifies the number of test cases. The conditions on the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) remain valid as they are part of the problem's precondition. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
