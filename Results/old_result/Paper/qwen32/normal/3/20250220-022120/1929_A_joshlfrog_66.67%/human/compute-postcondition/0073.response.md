Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `l` is the integer value provided by the user input, `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, and `e` is equal to `t`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains the same integer value representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `l` is the length of the list `nums` provided by the user, and `nums` is the list of integers from the input. The variable `x` holds the maximum value found in `nums`, and `y` holds the minimum value found in `nums`. The loop variable `e` will have completed all iterations, so it will be equal to `t`, the total number of test cases.
