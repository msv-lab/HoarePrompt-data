Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is an integer representing the length of the list `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is the maximum value found in `nums`; `y` is the minimum value found in `nums`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `x` will hold the largest number from the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the smallest number from the list `nums`. The values of `t` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
