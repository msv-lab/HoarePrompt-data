The code snippet `y = nums[i]` updates the value of `y` to the value of `nums[i]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is initially 1, `y` is updated to the first element of the list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `y` is `nums[1]`; `x` is now equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` was greater than `x`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
