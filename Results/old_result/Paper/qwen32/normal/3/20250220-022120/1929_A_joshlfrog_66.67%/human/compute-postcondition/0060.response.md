Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`. If `nums[i]` > `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. If `nums[i]` < `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.**
