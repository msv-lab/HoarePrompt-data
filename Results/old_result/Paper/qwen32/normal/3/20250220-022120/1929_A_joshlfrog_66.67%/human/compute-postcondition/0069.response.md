The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is set to `nums[i]`. `y` is `nums[i]`.**
