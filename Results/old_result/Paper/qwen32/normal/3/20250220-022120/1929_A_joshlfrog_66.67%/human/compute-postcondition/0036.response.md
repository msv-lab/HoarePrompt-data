Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` has been updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the previous `x`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, and `y` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than the previous `y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.**
