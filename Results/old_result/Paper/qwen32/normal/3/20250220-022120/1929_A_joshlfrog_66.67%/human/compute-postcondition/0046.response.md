Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i + 1]`. If `nums[i] < y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables `i`, `x`, and `y` after the execution of the if-else block. It retains the initial conditions and specifies the changes made based on the condition `nums[i] < y`.
