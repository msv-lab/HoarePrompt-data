To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
2. `l` is an integer representing the length of the list `nums`.
3. `nums` is a list of integers.
4. `x` is the maximum value found in `nums`.
5. `y` is the minimum value found in `nums`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(x - y)
```

### Analysis:
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.
- The expression `x - y` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `nums`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
