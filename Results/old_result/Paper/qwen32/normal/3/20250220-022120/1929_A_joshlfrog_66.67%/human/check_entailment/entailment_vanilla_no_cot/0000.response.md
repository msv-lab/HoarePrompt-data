Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. The provided program instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then computes the beauty as the sum of consecutive differences, which is the correct approach.
