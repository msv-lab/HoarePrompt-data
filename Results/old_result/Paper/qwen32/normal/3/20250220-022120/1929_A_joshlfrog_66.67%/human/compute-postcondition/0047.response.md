To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the purpose of the loop. The loop iterates over the list `nums` and updates the variables `x` and `y` based on the values in `nums`.

- `x` is updated to the maximum value found in `nums`.
- `y` is updated to the minimum value found in `nums`.

Given that the loop runs `l` times, where `l` is the length of the list `nums`, after all iterations, `x` will hold the maximum value in the list, and `y` will hold the minimum value in the list.

The other variables `t`, `l`, and `nums` remain unchanged throughout the loop, and `e` is incremented by 1 once at the beginning of the loop execution (outside the loop body).

Here is the final output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `l` is the integer value provided by the user input, `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, and `e` is `e + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `x` will be the largest number in the list `nums`, `y` will be the smallest number in the list `nums`, and `e` will have been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `l`, and `nums` remain the same.
