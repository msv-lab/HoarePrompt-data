The code snippet `x = nums[i]` updates the value of `x` to be the value of `nums[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `x` is now equal to `nums[2]`. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, `y`, and the conditions for `y` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `y` remains 100000000; `x` is `nums[2]`.**
