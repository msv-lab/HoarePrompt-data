Reasoning:
The given problem aims to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. 

The beauty of an array \( a \) is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

This is because all intermediate terms cancel out, and what remains is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.

The provided program attempts to find the maximum and minimum values in the array and then calculates the difference between them. However, the logic in the program is not correctly implemented. The program initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to 100000000, which are incorrect initial values for finding the maximum and minimum in an array of positive integers.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should initialize `x` (the maximum) to a very small value (or the first element of the array) and `y` (the minimum) to a very large value (or the first element of the array).

Here's the correct approach:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = max(nums)  # Initialize x to the maximum value in the array
        y = min(nums)  # Initialize y to the minimum value in the array
        print(x - y)

# Example usage
# func()
```

Given the current implementation of the program, it will not correctly compute the maximum beauty for all cases because the initial values of `x` and `y` are not appropriate.

Correctness: **False**
