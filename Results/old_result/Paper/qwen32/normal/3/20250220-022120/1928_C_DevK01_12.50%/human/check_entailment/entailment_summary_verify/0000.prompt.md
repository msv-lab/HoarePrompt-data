You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `q` and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` containing the integer square root of `q` if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with all divisors `i` of `q` such that `1 <= i < w` and `i >= x - 1`, and all divisors `q // i` of `q` such that `1 <= i < w` and `q // i >= x - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) that fit the given constraints. Specifically, the code uses a helper function `func_1` which is not defined in the provided code snippet. This makes it impossible to verify the correctness of the program without the definition of `func_1`.

However, even if we assume that `func_1` is correctly defined, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not properly handle all edge cases. For example, the code checks if \( y = n + x \) is even, but this check alone is not sufficient to determine the correct values of \( k \).

2. **Logic for Determining Possible \( k \) Values**: The logic for determining the possible values of \( k \) is not correctly implemented. The code attempts to find divisors of \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( q = (n - x) // 2 \) but does not correctly ensure that these divisors correspond to valid values of \( k \).

3. **Incorrect Use of Set**: The conversion of the list `L1` to a set to remove duplicates is not necessary and does not address the core issue of correctly identifying the values of \( k \).

4. **Missing Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is not defined, which makes it impossible to verify the correctness of the program.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate that the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
10 2
```
**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
**Actual Output:**
The program may not produce the correct output due to the undefined `func_1` and the incorrect logic for determining the possible values of \( k \).

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
