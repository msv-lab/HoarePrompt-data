### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to determine how many different values of `k` fit the given constraints for multiple test cases.
- Each test case provides Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling process.
- The settling process repeats every `2k - 2` positions, following a pattern where the first `k` positions are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`, the next `k - 2` positions are numbered `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`, and so on.
- We need to find all valid `k` values such that `k > 1` and the given `n` and `x` match the pattern.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- For each test case, it calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` because an even `y` is necessary for the pattern to fit.
- If `y` is even, it calculates `L1` by calling `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
- If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.
- It then converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- This function takes two parameters, `q` and `x`.
- It calculates the integer square root `w` of `q` and checks if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds `w` to the list `M`.
- It iterates over all integers `i` from `1` to `int(w // 1)`, checking if `i` and `q // i` are divisors of `q` and if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If they are, it adds them to `M`.
- Finally, it returns the list `M`.

#### Correctness:
- The program correctly checks if `y` is even, which is a necessary condition for the pattern to fit.
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies potential `k` values by considering the integer square root of `q` and its divisors.
- The program correctly combines results from two calls to `func_1` when `n >= 3 * x - 2` and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and provides the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
