Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues.

The program aims to find all possible values of `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the sequence described in the problem. The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and within each cycle, the first `k` positions are `1, 2, ..., k` and the next `k-2` positions are `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.

The approach in the program involves checking divisors of `(n + x - 2) / 2` and `(n - x) / 2` (when applicable) to find valid `k` values. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect divisor check**: The function `func_1` checks divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` to determine possible `k` values. However, it does not correctly account for the conditions under which `k` is valid. Specifically, it does not ensure that `k >= x` and `k <= n`.

2. **Handling of edge cases**: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when `n` is small relative to `x`.

3. **Logic for determining valid `k` values**: The logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed. For example, it does not correctly account for the fact that `k` must be such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the sequence.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over possible values of `k` and check if the number `x` appears at position `n` in the sequence for each `k`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = 0
    for k in range(x, n + 1):
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length
        
        if position_in_cycle < k - 1:
            if position_in_cycle + 1 == x:
                valid_ks += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_cycle == x:
                valid_ks += 1
    return valid_ks

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(find_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This corrected program iterates over all possible values of `k` from `x` to `n` and checks if the number `x` appears at position `n` in the sequence for each `k`. This ensures that all valid `k` values are correctly identified.
