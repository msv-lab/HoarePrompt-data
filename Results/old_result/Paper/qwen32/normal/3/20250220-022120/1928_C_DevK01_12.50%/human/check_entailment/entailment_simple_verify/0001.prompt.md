You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly addresses the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the number of possible values of `k` such that Vasya, standing at position `n` in a line, receives the number `x` during the "first-k-th" settling process. The sequence of numbers assigned to students repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

### Key Points:
1. **Sequence Repetition**: The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. **Position Calculation**: Given `n` and `x`, we need to check for which values of `k` the position `n` corresponds to the number `x`.
3. **Constraints**: `k > 1` and `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem using the following logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads `n` and `x`.
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if `(n + x)` is odd. If it is, it prints `0` because `k` cannot satisfy the conditions if `n + x` is odd.
3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - It calculates `y = (n + x - 2) // 2`.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to find divisors of `y` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calculates another value and adds more potential `k` values.
   - It removes duplicates from the list of potential `k` values and prints the count.

### Function `func_1`:
- This function finds divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- It also checks for other divisors of `q` and adds them to the list if they meet the criteria.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Finding `k`**: The logic for finding `k` seems flawed. The program uses a formula `(n + x - 2) // 2` which doesn't directly correspond to the problem's requirements.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when `n` and `x` are close to their bounds.
3. **Efficiency**: The program may not be efficient for large values of `n` and `x` due to the divisor-finding logic.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs a more accurate and efficient method to determine the valid `k` values based on the described sequence and constraints.
