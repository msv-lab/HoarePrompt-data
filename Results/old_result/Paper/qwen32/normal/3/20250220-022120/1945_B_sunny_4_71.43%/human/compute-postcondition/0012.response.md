The provided code snippet reassigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` based on the new input. The initial values of `A` and `B` are calculated using the old values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. Since the input values are reassigned, the initial values of `A` and `B` become invalid and need to be recalculated with the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers provided by the input; `A` and `B` are yet to be recalculated with the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
