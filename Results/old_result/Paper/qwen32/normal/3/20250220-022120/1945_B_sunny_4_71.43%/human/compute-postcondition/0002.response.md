The code snippet provided takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18. However, since `t` is not used in the provided code, it remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18, with `a`, `b`, and `m` assigned the values from the input.**
