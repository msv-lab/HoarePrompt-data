To determine the output of the print statement, let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet:

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: Must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the precondition).
2. **`a`**: An integer provided by the input.
3. **`b`**: An integer provided by the input.
4. **`m`**: An integer provided by the input.
5. **`A`**: Calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
6. **`B`**: Calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(A + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `A`**:
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `int(m / a)` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, which means it divides `m` by `a` and truncates the decimal part.
   - Adding 1 to the result gives `A`.

2. **Calculate `B`**:
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.
   - `int(m / b)` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, which means it divides `m` by `b` and truncates the decimal part.
   - Adding 1 to the result gives `B`.

3. **Sum `A` and `B`**:
   - The value printed is the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the sum of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **A + B (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**
