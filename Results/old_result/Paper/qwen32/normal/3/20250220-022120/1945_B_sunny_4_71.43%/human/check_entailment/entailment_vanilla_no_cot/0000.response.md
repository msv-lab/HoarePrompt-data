Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not account for the overlap of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time.

The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and then simply adds these numbers together. However, this approach does not consider the overlap of fireworks visibility periods, which can result in overestimating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping launch times and then calculate the number of fireworks visible at each possible overlapping time within the visibility period `m`. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time would be the maximum count of overlapping fireworks at any given time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        for i in range(l):
            count = 0
            if i % a <= m:
                count += m // a + 1
            if i % b <= m:
                count += m // b + 1
            if i % a <= m and i % b <= m:
                count -= m // l + 1
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b` and then iterates through each possible time within one period of the LCM to count the number of overlapping fireworks, adjusting for double-counted fireworks. The maximum count is then printed for each test case.
