Given the initial state:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the precondition).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers between 1 and 10^18.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(A + B)
```

Let's break down the values:

1. **A**: This is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`. Here, `int(m / a)` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, which means it divides `m` by `a` and discards the remainder, then adds 1 to the result.
2. **B**: This is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. Similarly, `int(m / b)` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, discards the remainder, then adds 1 to the result.

The `print` statement will output the sum of `A` and `B`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `A` and `B`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **A + B (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**
