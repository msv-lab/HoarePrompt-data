The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the current iteration. Since `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration (implied by the loop structure), we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 to allow the next iteration to occur.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers provided by the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**
