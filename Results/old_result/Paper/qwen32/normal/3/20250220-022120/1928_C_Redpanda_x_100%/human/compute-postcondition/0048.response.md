The code `yield factor` will cause the current state of the function to be saved and the value of `factor` to be returned to the caller. After the `yield` statement, the function will pause and can be resumed later. The variables `n`, `factors`, `nn`, `i`, and `primes` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the `yield` statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `factors` is `{3: 3, nn: factors.get(nn, 0) + 1}` if `nn` is greater than 1, otherwise `factors` is `{3: 3}`, `nn` is greater than 1 if the condition `nn > 1` is true, `i` is 4, `primes` is `[3, nn]` if `nn` is greater than 1, otherwise `primes` is `[3]`, and a value `factor` has been yielded.**
