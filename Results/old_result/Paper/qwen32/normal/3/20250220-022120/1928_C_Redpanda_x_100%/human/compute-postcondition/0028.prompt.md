Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a non-negative integer value, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times. `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
    yield factor * prime_to_i
    prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is `prime`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a non-negative integer value, `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times, `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a value of `factors[prime] + 1`, `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times, `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime * prime`, `factors` is a dictionary containing the key `prime` with a value of `factors[prime]`, `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime]` times, `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
