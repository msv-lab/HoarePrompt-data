You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate` is a generator that yields all possible products of powers of prime numbers up to a certain point, based on the input `k`. It recursively generates these products by considering each prime number and its associated power, as defined in the `factors` dictionary. The final state of the program after it concludes is that all valid products have been yielded.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not appear to correctly solve the problem described. The given code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `generate`, but it does not directly address the problem of finding the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position and number.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be trying to factorize a number `n` and generate factors, but it does not use the factorization results in a meaningful way to solve the problem.
   - The function does not take into account the position `n` and the number `x` that Vasya received.
   - The function `generate` is called within `func_1`, but it doesn't seem to contribute to solving the problem either.

2. **Function `generate`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate factors based on the prime factorization of `n` from `func_1`, but it doesn't use the factors to determine the valid `k` values.
   - The function yields factors, but it does not relate these factors to the problem's requirements.

3. **Lack of Implementation for Problem Requirements**:
   - The core of the problem requires finding the number of `k` values such that Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described settling pattern.
   - The provided code does not implement any logic to determine the valid `k` values based on `n` and `x`.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - The code does not produce any output that matches the expected results for the given example test cases.
   - For example, for the input `10 2`, the expected output is `4`, but the provided code does not output anything.

Given these points, it is clear that the provided code is not solving the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
