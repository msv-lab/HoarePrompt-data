The code snippet `y -= i - 1` modifies the value of `y` by subtracting `i - 1` from it. Given the initial state, the value of `y` changes, while the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. The value of `y` is now `y - (i - 1)`.**
