To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. Therefore, the variables `i` and the length of the list `a` are the only ones we can adjust.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1.
2. **Length of `a`**: The loop will execute if the length of `a` is greater than 1, because `range(1, len(a))` will generate at least one value (i.e., 1) if `len(a) > 1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the list `a` has at least two elements for the loop to execute. The other variables (`ans`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `tmp`) are not mentioned in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
