Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `a` retain their input values, and `tmp` is a list containing at least one element, for example, `[1]`. `i` is 1.**
