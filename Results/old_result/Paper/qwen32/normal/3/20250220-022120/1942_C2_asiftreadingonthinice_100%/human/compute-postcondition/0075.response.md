The code snippet appends the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 5, the expression evaluates to `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`. The list `a` remains sorted and has at least 6 elements. The list `tmp` will now include the newly calculated value.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 6 elements, `i` is 5, `tmp` includes the value `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`**.
