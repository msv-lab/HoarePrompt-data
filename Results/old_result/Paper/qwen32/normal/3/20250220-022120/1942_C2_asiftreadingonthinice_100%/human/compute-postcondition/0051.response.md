To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables `ans` and `y`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initially calculated based on the conditions involving `a` and the differences between its elements.
   - `tmp` is a sorted list of half differences of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference but are not 2, and possibly includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the difference is even and not 2.
   
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `tmp`.
   - For each `i`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then:
     - `ans` is incremented by `i`.
     - `y` is decremented by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the loop terminates.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` for each `i` in `tmp`. The final state will be reached when either:
- The loop iterates over all elements in `tmp`.
- `y` becomes less than `i - 1` for some `i` in `tmp`.

### Output State:
- **ans**: The final value of `ans` will be the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that are processed before `y` becomes less than `i - 1`.
- **y**: The final value of `y` will be the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` for each `i` processed in `tmp`.

### Conclusion:
Given the loop's behavior and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, the final output state after all iterations can be described as follows:

- **ans**: The initial `ans` value plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that were processed.
- **y**: The remaining value of `y` after the loop terminates.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all `i` values from `tmp` that were processed, and `y` is the remaining value of `y` after the loop terminates.**
