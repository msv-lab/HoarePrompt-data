The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `tmp`. Since `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list `tmp`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`.

To execute one more iteration, `i` should be updated to the next element in `tmp`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`**
