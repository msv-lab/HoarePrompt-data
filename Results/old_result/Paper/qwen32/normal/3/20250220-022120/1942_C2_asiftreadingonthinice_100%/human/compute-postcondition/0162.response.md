Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents a specific computation based on the given constraints, ensuring the result does not exceed `n - 2`.**
