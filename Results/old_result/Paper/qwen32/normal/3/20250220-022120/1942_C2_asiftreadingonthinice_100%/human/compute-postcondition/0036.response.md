The code snippet `ans += i` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element, `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, and `ans` is increased by `i`.**
