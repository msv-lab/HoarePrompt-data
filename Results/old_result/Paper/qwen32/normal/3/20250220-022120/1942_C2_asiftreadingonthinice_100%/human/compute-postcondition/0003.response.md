The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state of `t`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this operation, but `a` is newly introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers provided by the input, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
