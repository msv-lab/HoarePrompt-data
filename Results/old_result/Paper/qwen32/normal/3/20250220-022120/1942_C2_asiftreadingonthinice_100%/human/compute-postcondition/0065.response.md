The code snippet appends the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` will be an integer. The precondition that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2 remains valid. The only change is that `tmp` now includes the new element.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. The current difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even. `tmp` includes an additional element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
