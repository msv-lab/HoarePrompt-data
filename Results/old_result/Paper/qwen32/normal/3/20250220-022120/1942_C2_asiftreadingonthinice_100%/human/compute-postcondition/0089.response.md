The code snippet provided is `ans += i`. This line of code adds the value of `i` to the current value of `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `ans`. The other variables `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i`; `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a`; `ii` is the initial value of `ii` plus `len(a) - 1`; `tt` remains the same; `n` and `x` remain the values read from the input; `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input; `tmp` is a list that must have at least one element; `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**
