The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. 

The initial state mentions that `ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is incremented by 1, and `tt` remains the same. However, these changes do not affect the execution of the given code snippet because the code only reads new values for `n`, `x`, and `y` and does not modify `ans`, `ii`, or `tt`.

Therefore, after the code execution, `n`, `x`, and `y` will have the values provided by the input, while `ans`, `ii`, and `tt` will retain their values as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input.**
