The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, so these will be determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers provided by the input.**
