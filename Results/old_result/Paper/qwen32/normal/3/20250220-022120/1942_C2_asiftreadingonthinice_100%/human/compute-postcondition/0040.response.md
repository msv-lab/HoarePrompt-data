Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element. If `y` was initially greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is now `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is increased by `i`. Otherwise, `y` is less than `i - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
