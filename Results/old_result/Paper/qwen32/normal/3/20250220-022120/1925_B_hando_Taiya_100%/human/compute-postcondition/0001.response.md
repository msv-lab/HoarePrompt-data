The code initializes a variable `ans` to 0. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are only mentioned in the initial state and not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `ans` is 0.** 

This means `t`, `x`, and `n` retain their initial values, and `ans` is set to 0.
