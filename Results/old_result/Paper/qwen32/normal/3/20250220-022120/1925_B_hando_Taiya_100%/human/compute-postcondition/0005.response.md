Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i`; `i` is a divisor of `x` such that `x % i == 0`. The current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
