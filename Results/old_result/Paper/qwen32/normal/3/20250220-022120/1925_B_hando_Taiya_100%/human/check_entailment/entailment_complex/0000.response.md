### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the maximum balance (GCD of the difficulties) of a problemset consisting of `n` sub-problems with a total difficulty of `x`. 

The approach taken in the program is to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (`x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`. This works because if `d` is a divisor of `x`, then `x` can be split into `n` sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty of `d` or `x // d`, ensuring that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties is `d`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads two integers `x` (total difficulty) and `n` (number of sub-problems).
2. **Finding Divisors**: The program iterates through all possible divisors up to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive). This is efficient because if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor.
3. **Checking Conditions**: For each divisor `i`:
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, it updates the answer (`ans`) to be the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`.
   - If the corresponding pair divisor `x // i` is less than or equal to `n`, it updates the answer (`ans`) to be the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i`.
4. **Output**: After checking all divisors, the program prints the maximum balance (`ans`) for each test case.

The provided program correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem.
