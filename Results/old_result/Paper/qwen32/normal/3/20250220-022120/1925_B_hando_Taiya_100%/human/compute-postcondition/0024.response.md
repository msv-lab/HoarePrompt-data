To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's walk through the conditions and logic implied by the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` and `n` are integers where \(1 \leq n \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `ans` is defined as the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` represents the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies one of the following conditions:
     - The divisor itself is less than or equal to `n`.
     - The corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - To find `ans`, we need to iterate through potential divisors of `x` and check the conditions mentioned above.
   - The largest such divisor is selected as `ans`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The value of `ans` is determined based on the specific values of `x` and `n`, but we know for sure that it will be the largest divisor of `x` that meets the given conditions.

Given the constraints and the definition of `ans`, we can't compute the exact numerical value without specific values for `x` and `n`. However, we can describe the output as the value of `ans` based on the conditions provided.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or whose corresponding pair divisor (x // i) is less than or equal to n)**
