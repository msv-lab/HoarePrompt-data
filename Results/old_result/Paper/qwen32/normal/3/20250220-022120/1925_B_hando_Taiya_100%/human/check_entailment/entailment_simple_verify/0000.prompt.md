You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers x and n such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or whose corresponding pair divisor (i.e., `x // i`) is less than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or whose corresponding pair divisor (x // i) is less than or equal to n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating through the divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems with the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Iterate through divisors**: The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `d` is a divisor of `x`, then `x/d` is also a divisor, and one of them will be less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

2. **Check divisibility and feasibility**:
   - For each divisor `i`, the program checks if `n <= x // i`. If true, it means `i` can be used as a difficulty for one of the sub-problems, and the remaining difficulties can be distributed among the other sub-problems.
   - Similarly, the program checks if `n <= i`. If true, it means `x // i` can be used as a difficulty for one of the sub-problems, and the remaining difficulties can be distributed among the other sub-problems.

3. **Update the maximum balance**: The program keeps track of the maximum balance found during the iteration.

4. **Output the result**: For each test case, the program prints the maximum balance.

Let's verify the logic using the provided examples:

- **First test case (10 3)**: The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The program checks:
  - `i = 1`: `n <= 10 // 1` (3 <= 10) and `n <= 1` (3 <= 1) are false, so no update.
  - `i = 2`: `n <= 10 // 2` (3 <= 5) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 2)` -> `ans = 2`.
  - `i = 5`: `n <= 10 // 5` (3 <= 2) is false, but `n <= 5` (3 <= 5) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 2)` -> `ans = 2`.
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Second test case (5 5)**: The divisors of 5 are 1, 5. The program checks:
  - `i = 1`: `n <= 5 // 1` (5 <= 5) and `n <= 1` (5 <= 1) are false, so no update.
  - `i = 5`: `n <= 5 // 5` (5 <= 1) is false, but `n <= 5` (5 <= 5) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 1)` -> `ans = 1`.
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Third test case (420 69)**: The divisors of 420 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420. The program checks:
  - `i = 6`: `n <= 420 // 6` (69 <= 70) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 6)` -> `ans = 6`.
  - The program correctly outputs `6`.

The program handles all edge cases and the logic is sound, ensuring that the maximum balance is found for every test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
