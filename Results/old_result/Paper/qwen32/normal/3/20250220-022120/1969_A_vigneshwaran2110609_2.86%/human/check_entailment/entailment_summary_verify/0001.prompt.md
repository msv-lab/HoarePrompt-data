You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks a specific condition related to the list `p` and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether the condition is met or not. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
Monocarp wants to invite a minimum number of friends to his party such that at least two of them attend. A friend will only attend if they and their best friend receive invitations. The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and their best friend list `p`. It then attempts to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

#### Key Points from the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case:
        - It reads the number of friends `x`.
        - It reads the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Invitations:**
    - The program iterates over the list of best friends.
    - It checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. This condition is incorrect because it doesn't check if the best friend relationship is mutual and doesn't ensure that at least two friends can come to the party.
    - If the condition is met, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
    - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints `3`.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Condition:**
    - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is not meaningful for the problem. It doesn't check if the best friend relationship is mutual or if sending invitations to these friends will ensure that at least two friends come to the party.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
    - The program assumes that if a mutual best friend pair is found, only two invitations are needed. However, this is not always true. For example, in a scenario where no mutual best friend pairs exist, more than two invitations might be needed.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
    - The program does not handle cases where no mutual best friend pairs exist and more than two invitations might be necessary. For example, in the second test case provided, the correct answer is `3`, but the program might incorrectly print `2` if it finds a pair that satisfies the incorrect condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
2. If such pairs exist, the minimum number of invitations is `2`.
3. If no such pairs exist, we need to find the smallest set of invitations that ensures at least two friends come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required. It uses an incorrect condition and does not handle all edge cases properly.
