You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks a specific condition related to the list `p` and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether the condition is met or not. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Invitation Count**: The program incorrectly assumes that if a friend and their best friend are mutual best friends (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`), then only 2 invitations are needed. This is not always true. For example, consider the case where the best friend relationships form a cycle or a chain, and more than 2 invitations are necessary.

2. **Handling of Non-Mutual Best Friend Relationships**: The program does not handle cases where best friend relationships are not mutual. It only checks for mutual relationships and then breaks out of the loop, which is not sufficient for determining the minimum number of invitations needed.

3. **Incorrect Invitation Count for General Cases**: The program incorrectly prints `3` if no mutual best friend relationship is found. This is not always the correct answer, as the minimum number of invitations needed can vary based on the specific best friend relationships.

Let's consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
4
2 3 4 1

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
2
```

In this example, the best friend relationships form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1. To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends (e.g., friends 1, 2, and 3). The program incorrectly outputs `2` because it does not properly account for the need to invite more than 2 friends in such cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct output is `False`.
