Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step.

Initial State:
- `x` must be greater than 0.
- `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`.
- `flag` is True.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

Explanation:
- The `print` statement is outputting the integer value `2`.
- The value to be printed is explicitly `2` and does not depend on the variables `x`, `l`, `i`, or `flag`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the number `2`.

Output: **2**
