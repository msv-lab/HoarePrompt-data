The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must be greater than 0, and `i` has been incremented by 1 to reach the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, and it must still be less than `x`.

State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
