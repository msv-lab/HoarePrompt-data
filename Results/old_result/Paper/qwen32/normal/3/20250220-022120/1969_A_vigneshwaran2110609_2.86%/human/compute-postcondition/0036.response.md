The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `flag`. The values of `x` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `flag` is `True`.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `flag` is `True`**.
