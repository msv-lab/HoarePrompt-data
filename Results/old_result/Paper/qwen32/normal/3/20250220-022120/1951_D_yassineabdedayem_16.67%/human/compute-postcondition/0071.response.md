The value of `number` is updated to `Min`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is `Min`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
