Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either ['2', str(number)] or ['5', str(number)], `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.**

In natural language: The value of `rep` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
