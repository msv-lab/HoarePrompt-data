Given the code snippet `n -= Min * Max`, we need to determine the new state of the variables after this operation. The variables `Min` and `Max` are defined as `Min = min(n // k, k)` and `Max = max(int(n / k), k)` respectively. The variable `n` is initially defined as `n - Min * Max`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `n` is `n - Min * Max`
   - `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k and n * Min <= k`
   - `rep` is 2
   - `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number), str(number)]` or `['5', str(number), str(number)]`
   - `number` is either `Min` or `Max`
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting `Min * Max` from it.
   - Since `n` is initially defined as `n - Min * Max`, we can interpret this as `n` being reduced by `Min * Max` from its original value.

3. **New State of `n`**:
   - After executing `n -= Min * Max`, `n` will be reduced by another `Min * Max`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `n` will be `n - Min * Max - Min * Max`, which simplifies to `n - 2 * Min * Max`.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - 2 * Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number), str(number)]` or `['5', str(number), str(number)]`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.
