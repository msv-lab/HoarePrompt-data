Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 10, `k` is 5, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**

Explanation: The value of `number` has been updated to the value of `Max`, which is 5. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` is still valid since `Max` (5) is not equal to `k` (5) is false, but `n * Min` (10 * 2 = 20) is greater than `k` (5) is true.
