The given initial state includes several variable assignments and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This suggests that `t` has been decremented by 1, but its initial value is not provided.
- `n` is `0`: The variable `n` is explicitly set to 0.
- `k` is `0`: The variable `k` is explicitly set to 0.
- `rep` is `1`: The variable `rep` is explicitly set to 1.
- `tab` is `['5']`: The variable `tab` is a list containing the string `'5'`.
- `number` is `5`: The variable `number` is explicitly set to 5.
- `k` equals `0`: This is a reiteration that `k` is 0.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the values of the variables do not affect the output.

Output: **YES**
