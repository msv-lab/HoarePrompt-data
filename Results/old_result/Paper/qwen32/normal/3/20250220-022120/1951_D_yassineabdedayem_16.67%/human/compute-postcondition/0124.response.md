The value of `number` is updated to be equal to `Max`, which is 5. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `n` is 5, `k` is 1, `rep` is 1, `tab` is `['5']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 5, `number` is 5.
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 5, `k` is 1, `rep` is 1, `tab` is `['5']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 5, `number` is 5**.
