The value of `n` is decremented by the product of `Min` and `Max`. Given that `Min` is 2 and `Max` is 5, the product is 10. Therefore, `n` is reduced by 10 from its initial value of 10, resulting in `n` being 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `['5']`, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, `number` is 5**.
