The value of `n` is updated by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. Given that `Min` is `-2` and `Max` is `1`, the product `Min * Max` is `-2 * 1 = -2`. Therefore, `n -= Min * Max` translates to `n = n - (-2)`, which means `n = -2 - (-2) = -2 + 2 = 0`. The values of `t`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `0`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `-2` and one string representation of `1`, `Min` is `-2`, `Max` is `1`.**
