The code snippet `k = k - Max` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting the current value of `Max` from it. Given the initial state, `Max` is equal to `k`, so `k - Max` will result in `0`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` remains `k`, but `k` has been updated to `0`.
- `rep` remains 1.
- `tab` remains a list containing the string representation of `number`.
- `Min` remains 1.
- `Max` remains `k`, which is now `0`.
- `number` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 0, `number` is 1.**
