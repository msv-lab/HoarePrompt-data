The code snippet provided is `n -= Min * Max`. Given the initial state, `n` is initially 10, `Min` is 2, and `Max` is 5. Therefore, `Min * Max` equals `2 * 5`, which is `10`. The operation `n -= Min * Max` subtracts `10` from `n`, resulting in `n` being `0`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet. Here, `t`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`, `Min`, and `Max` are not modified by the code snippet.

The condition `If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is 0 and number is 2. Otherwise, k is 3 and number is 5` does not affect the value of `n` or any other variable directly in this code snippet. It only influences the initial values of `k` and `number` based on the conditions provided, but since `n` has already been set to 10 and `Min` and `Max` are constants, this condition does not change `n` in this context.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or 3, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is either 2 or 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5.**
