To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (However, the value of `t` is not explicitly given, so we can ignore this for the purpose of this print statement).
- `n` is `0`.
- `k` is `0`.
- `rep` is `1`.
- `tab` is `['5']` (a list containing a single string element '5').
- `number` is `5`.
- `k` equals `0` (repeated, but consistent with the previous information).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(len(tab))
```

### Analysis:
- The `tab` variable is a list containing one element, which is the string `'5'`.
- The `len(tab)` function calculates the length of the list `tab`, which is the number of elements in the list.
- Since `tab` has one element, `len(tab)` will return `1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the length of the list `tab`, which is `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
