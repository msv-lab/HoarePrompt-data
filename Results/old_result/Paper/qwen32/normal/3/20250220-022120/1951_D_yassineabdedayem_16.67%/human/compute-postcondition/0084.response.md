Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Min`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number)]` or `['5', str(number)]`, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`. All other variables retain their initial values.
