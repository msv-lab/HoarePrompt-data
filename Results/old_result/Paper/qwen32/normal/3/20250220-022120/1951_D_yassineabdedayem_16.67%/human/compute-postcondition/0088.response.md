The code snippet provided is `rep += 1`, which increments the value of `rep` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `number`, `Min`, `Max`) are not affected by this operation.

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - 2 * Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number), str(number)]` or `['5', str(number), str(number)]`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`

After executing `rep += 1`, the value of `rep` changes from 2 to 3.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - 2 * Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `rep` is 3, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number), str(number)]` or `['5', str(number), str(number)]`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**
