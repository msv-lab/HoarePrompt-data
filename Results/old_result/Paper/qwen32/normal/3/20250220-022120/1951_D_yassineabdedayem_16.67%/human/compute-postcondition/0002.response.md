The provided code snippet reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^18. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will be updated to the values read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.**
