The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Given the initial conditions, `number` is `-2` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise it is `1`. Since `Max` is `1`, `k` is `0` and `n * Min` is `4`, which does not satisfy `n * Min <= k`. Therefore, `k` is `3` and `number` is `1`. The list `tab` initially contains two identical string representations of `number` (which was `-2` initially, but this changes based on the condition). After appending `str(number)`, `tab` will contain three elements: two string representations of `-2` and one string representation of `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `-2`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `-2` and one string representation of `1`, `Min` is `-2`, `Max` is `1`.**
