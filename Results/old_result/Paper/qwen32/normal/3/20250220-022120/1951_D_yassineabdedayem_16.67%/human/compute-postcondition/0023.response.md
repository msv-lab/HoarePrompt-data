Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `k`, `k` is `k - Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `k + Min`, `number` is `k + Min`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is reduced by `Min` (which is 1), so `k` becomes `k - 1`. Consequently, `Max` and `number`, which were initially equal to `k`, now become `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
