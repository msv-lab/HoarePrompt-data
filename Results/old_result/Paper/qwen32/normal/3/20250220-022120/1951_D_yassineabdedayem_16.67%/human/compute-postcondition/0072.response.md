Given the initial state, we need to determine the new value of `k` after the execution of `k = k - Max`. We know that `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`.

Let's break it down:

1. `Max` is either `n // k` or `k`, whichever is larger.
2. `k` is then updated to `k - Max`.

Since `Max` is the larger of `n // k` and `k`, subtracting `Max` from `k` will result in a non-positive value for `k` (i.e., `k - Max <= 0`).

Let's consider the two possible scenarios for `Max`:

- If `Max = k`, then `k = k - k = 0`.
- If `Max = n // k`, then `k = k - (n // k)`. Since `n // k` is an integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `k` will become a non-positive value.

In both cases, `k` will be non-positive after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is `Min`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`, `k` is non-positive.**
