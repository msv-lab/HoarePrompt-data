The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`. Given that `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0, the new value of `k` will be `k - Min`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is `k - Min`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is `Max`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`**.
