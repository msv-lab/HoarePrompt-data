Let's analyze the loop and the given output states to determine the final state after all iterations.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer read from input
- `k` is the second integer read from input
- `rep` is 0
- `tab` is `[]`
- `number` is 0

### Loop Conditions:
1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

### Loop Body:
- `Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)`
- If `Max == k and n * Min <= k`:
  - `number = Min`
  - `k = k - Max`
- Else:
  - `number = Max`
  - `k = k - Min`
- `tab.append(str(number))`
- `n -= Min * Max`
- `rep += 1`

### Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `n` is 0
   - `rep` is 1
   - `tab` is `['5']`
   - `Min` is 2
   - `Max` is 5
   - `number` is 5

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `n` is 0
   - `rep` is 2
   - `tab` is `['5', '5']`
   - `Min` is 1
   - `Max` is 5
   - `k` is 0
   - `number` is 5

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `n` is 0
   - `rep` is 3
   - `tab` is `['5', '5', '1']`
   - `Min` is 1
   - `Max` is 1
   - `k` is 0
   - `number` is 1

### Analysis:
- From the first iteration:
  - `n` was reduced to 0, indicating that `Min * Max` equals the initial `n`.
  - `Min` was 2, and `Max` was 5, so `n = 2 * 5 = 10`.
  - `k` must have been 5 because `Max` is `k` and `n * Min <= k` is not true (since `10 * 2 > 5`).

- From the second iteration:
  - `k` was reduced to 0, indicating that `k - Max` equals 0.
  - `Max` was 5, so `k` must have been 5.
  - `Min` was 1, so `n = 1 * 5 = 5` (but `n` was already 0 from the first iteration, so this `n` is not the initial `n` but the remaining `n` after the first iteration).
  - `k` was reduced by `Max` which is 5, so `k` became 0.

- From the third iteration:
  - `k` was already 0, so the loop should have stopped after the second iteration.
  - However, the loop continued because `rep < 60` and `n` was 0, but `rep` was incremented to 3.
  - `Min` and `Max` were both 1, indicating that `n` was 1 (which is not possible since `n` was already 0).
  - This iteration seems to be a redundant iteration because `k` is 0 and `n` is 0.

### Conclusion:
The loop should have stopped after the second iteration because `k` became 0. The third iteration is redundant and does not affect the final state.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains 1
- `n` is 0
- `rep` is 2 (since the loop stops after the second iteration)
- `tab` is `['5', '5']`
- `k` is 0
- `number` is 5 (from the last valid iteration)

Output State: **t is 1, n is 0, rep is 2, tab is ['5', '5'], k is 0, number is 5.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the final state is that `t` remains 1, `n` is 0, the loop has executed 2 times (`rep` is 2), the `tab` list contains `['5', '5']`, `k` is 0, and the last `number` added to `tab` was 5.
