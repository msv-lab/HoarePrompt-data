Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is `-2`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is `-2`, `Max` is `1`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `0` and `number` is `-2`. Otherwise, `k` is `3` and `number` is `1`.**
