Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations provided.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where:
- Each player has `n` cards.
- Each card has an integer from 1 to `n`, with each integer appearing exactly twice in the deck.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table, and you score a point if the card you place has already been placed by the other player.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Key Observations
1. **Pairs of Cards**: The maximum points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have because each pair can potentially score you 1 point if Nene doesn't score on it first.
2. **Nene's Optimal Play**: Since Nene plays optimally, she will block you from scoring if possible. However, the problem asks for the maximum score you can achieve assuming Nene plays optimally. Thus, the limiting factor is the number of pairs you have.
3. **Limiting Factor**: The maximum points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs you have (`pairs`) and the number of turns you get (`n // 2`), since you take `n` turns in total.

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, a)`: This function calculates the number of pairs in your hand and returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1(n, a)`
- **State Before Function Call**: `n` is the number of cards each player receives, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times.
- **Logic**:
  - `counter = Counter(a)`: This creates a dictionary where keys are the integers on the cards and values are their counts.
  - `pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)`: This counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
  - `return min(pairs, n // 2)`: This returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which represents the maximum points you can score.

#### Function `func_2()`
- **State Before Function Call**: The input is read from standard input and split into a list of strings.
- **Logic**:
  - `t = int(data[idx])`: This reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `n = int(data[idx])`: This reads the number of cards for the current test case.
    - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))`: This reads the list of integers representing the cards in your hand.
    - `results.append(func_1(n, a))`: This appends the result of `func_1` to the `results` list.
  - `for result in results: print(result)`: This prints the results for all test cases.

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm that the logic of the code aligns with the intended behavior:
- The annotations for `func_1` correctly describe the state before the function call and the logic inside the function.
- The annotations for `func_2` describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case and confirm that the results are correctly computed and printed.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by considering the number of pairs in your hand and the number of turns you have. The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
