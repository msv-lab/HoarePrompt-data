The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This list is assigned to the variable `data`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
