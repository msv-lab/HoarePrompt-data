The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - 1:idx + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `5 + 2*n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)` twice.**
