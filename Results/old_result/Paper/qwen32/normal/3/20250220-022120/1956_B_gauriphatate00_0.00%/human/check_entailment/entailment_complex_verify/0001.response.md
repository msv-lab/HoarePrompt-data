### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of points you can score in a card game.
- **Game Rules**:
  - You and Nene each have `n` cards.
  - Each card has an integer from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
  - You take `n` turns, and Nene takes `n` turns.
  - During each turn, a player selects a card and places it on the table.
  - A player scores a point if a card with the same integer is already on the table.
  - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
- **Key Insight**: The maximum points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have that can be placed on the table after the opponent's optimal play.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Calculate the maximum number of points you can score.
  - **Logic**:
    - Count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand (`pairs`).
    - The maximum points you can score is `min(pairs, n // 2)`, where `n // 2` is the number of turns you have.
    - This logic is based on the observation that you can score at most one point for each pair of cards you have, and you have `n` turns.
- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Read input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results.
  - **Logic**:
    - Read the input data.
    - For each test case, extract `n` and the list `a` of integers.
    - Call `func_1(n, a)` to calculate the maximum points for that test case.
    - Store the result and print it after processing all test cases.

#### Annotations Validation:
- **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
  - **State Before Call**: `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice.
  - **Logic**: The function correctly counts the number of pairs in `a` and returns `min(pairs, n // 2)`.
- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - **State Before Call**: Input data is read and split into a list of strings.
  - **Logic**: The function correctly processes each test case by extracting `n` and `a`, calling `func_1`, and storing the results.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum number of points you can score based on the number of pairs in your hand and the number of turns you have.
- The logic in `func_2` is correct because it correctly reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
