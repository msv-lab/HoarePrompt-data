The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which iterates over the `results` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - n - 1:idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is the position right after the last processed segment of data, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one element, and `result` is the first element of `results`**
