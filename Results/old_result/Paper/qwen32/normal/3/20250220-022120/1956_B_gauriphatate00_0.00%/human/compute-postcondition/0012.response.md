The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop iterates `t` times, and the state of `t` does not change within the loop head. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to consider the decrement of the loop counter `t`.

Given that the loop will execute `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`

Since the loop counter `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`**
