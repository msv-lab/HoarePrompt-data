### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
- You and Nene each have `n` cards.
- Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
- You and Nene take turns placing cards on the table.
- You score a point if a card you place already has a matching card on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
- We need to determine the maximum number of points you can score.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Pairs of Cards**: The maximum points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have. Each pair can potentially score you 1 point.
2. **Nene's Optimal Play**: Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to block you from scoring if possible. However, the problem states that you need to determine the maximum score you can achieve assuming Nene plays optimally. This means that you need to focus on the number of pairs you have, as this is the limiting factor in your score.
3. **Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs of cards you have (`pairs`) and the number of turns you get (`n // 2`). Since you take `n` turns, and each turn can potentially result in a point if there's a pair, the maximum points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
  - This function calculates the number of pairs in the list `a` using `collections.Counter`.
  - It then returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
  - This logic is correct because it accounts for the maximum number of points you can score given the constraints.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - This function reads input from standard input.
  - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and stores the results.
  - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary provided states that the function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result of processing each test case. It also mentions that the processing involves determining if the list `a` contains pairs of each integer from 1 through `n`. If it does, the function prints `True`; otherwise, it prints `False`. However, this summary is inaccurate because the function does not print `True` or `False`. Instead, it prints the maximum number of points you can score for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is mostly accurate, but the function summary provided is incorrect. The code correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

### Final: **True**
