To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Summary:
- You and Nene each have `n` cards, with each card having an integer from 1 to `n` and each integer appearing exactly twice in the deck.
- You and Nene take turns placing cards on the table.
- You score a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
- The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. If a card appears twice in your hand, you can score a point if Nene places the same card on the table before you place the second card.
2. If a card appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with it unless Nene places the same card on the table before you.
3. Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. This means she will try to avoid giving you points and will place cards that prevent you from scoring points.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
- It calculates the number of pairs (`count == 2`) in your hand.
- The function `func_1` returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which represents the maximum points you can score.

### Correctness Check:
- The code correctly identifies the number of pairs in your hand.
- The result is the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because:
  - You can score at most one point per pair if Nene places the other card of the pair on the table before you.
  - You can take at most `n // 2` turns, so you can score at most `n // 2` points in total.

### Edge Cases:
- If there are no pairs in your hand, the function correctly returns 0.
- If all cards in your hand are pairs, the function correctly returns `n // 2` because you can score at most one point per pair.
- If Nene plays optimally, she will try to prevent you from scoring points, but the code assumes the worst-case scenario for you (best-case for Nene) by returning the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score given the constraints and the optimal play from Nene. It handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly identifies the number of pairs in your hand and calculates the maximum points you can score by taking the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which accounts for the optimal play from Nene.
