Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `5 + 2*n + n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)` three times.**

Explanation: The value of `results` is updated to include one more element, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, a)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
