Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2 + n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it `2 + n + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
