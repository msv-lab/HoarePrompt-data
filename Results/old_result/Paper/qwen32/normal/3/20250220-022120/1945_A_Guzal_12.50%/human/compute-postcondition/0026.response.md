Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is updated to be `k` plus `a` plus the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
