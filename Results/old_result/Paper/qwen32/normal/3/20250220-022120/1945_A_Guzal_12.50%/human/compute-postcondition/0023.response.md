The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `a`, `b`, and `c` does not matter because they are being reassigned. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
