Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` now equals `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
