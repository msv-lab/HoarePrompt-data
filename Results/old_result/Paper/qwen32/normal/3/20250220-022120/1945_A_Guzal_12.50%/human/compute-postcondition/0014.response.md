The code snippet reads three integers from the input line and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the new integers provided in the input. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the new input values, while `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
