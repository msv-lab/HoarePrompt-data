The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, `k`) and their constraints or initial values, but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the integer `-1`.

Let's break down the situation:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 1,000,000,000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though its initial value is not specified).
- `k` is initialized to 0.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1**
