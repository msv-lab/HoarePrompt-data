In the provided initial state, we have several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `k`) with specific constraints, but the Python code snippet provided is simply `print(-1)`. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `k`, the print statement will output the integer `-1`.

Let's break down the given information and the code:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is not divisible by 3.
- `c` is less than 3.
- The sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3.

Despite these constraints on the variables, the print statement `print(-1)` does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **-1**
