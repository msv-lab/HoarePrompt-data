### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the conditions given in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`):**
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means that buying yogurts individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and buys the remaining single yogurt at the regular price (`a`).

3. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`):**
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means that buying yogurts individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program's logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9 is False).
  - Therefore, it buys two yogurts at the promotion price: `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9 is False).
  - Therefore, it buys one pair at the promotion price and one yogurt individually: `3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 14`.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11 is True).
  - Therefore, it buys all yogurts individually: `3 * 5 = 15`.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11 is True).
  - Therefore, it buys all yogurts individually: `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program's logic and output match the expected results for the example test cases provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

**Correctness: True**
