Let's analyze the given problem step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This integer `t` represents the number of test cases.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input for each test case.
3. The behavior of the program is described based on the parity of `n` (whether `n` is odd or even):
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if \(2 \times a < b\). This condition does not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - If `n` is even, the program also checks if \(2 \times a < b\). This condition does not affect the `print` statement directly.
4. The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations, indicating that there are `t` test cases in total.
5. The `print` statement inside the loop is `print(a * n)`.

### Analysis:
For each test case, the program will print the value of `a * n`. The value of `a` and `n` are specific to each test case and are read from the input.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `a` and `n` for each test case.

The program will print `a * n` for each of the `t` test cases.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers read from the input for each test case)**
