Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to verify its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts with a promotion.

### Program Analysis
The provided program handles the cases for both odd and even `n` as follows:

1. **If `n` is odd:**
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion, so the cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`, which means buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the last yogurt individually.

2. **If `n` is even:**
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion, so the cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b`, which means buying all yogurts as pairs at the promotion price.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it mentions an issue with the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a < b` is false, but the program still calculates the cost as `a * n`.

### Challenge to Original Assessment
Let's revisit the specific example provided in the original assessment:
- **Case:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- **Program Calculation:** `n % 2` is true (odd `n`), and `2 * a < b` is false (`2 * 5 < 11` is false).
- **Program Output:** `n // 2 * b + a` = `3 // 2 * 11 + 5` = `1 * 11 + 5` = `16`.
- **Expected Output:** `11 + 5` = `16`.

The program correctly calculates the cost as `16` for this case, which matches the expected output. Therefore, the original assessment's claim about this specific example is incorrect.

### General Verification
Let's verify the logic for different scenarios:
- **Case 1:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11` (even `n`), `2 * a < b` is false.
  - Program Output: `n // 2 * b` = `4 // 2 * 11` = `2 * 11` = `22`.
  - Expected Output: `22`.
- **Case 2:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11` (odd `n`), `2 * a < b` is false.
  - Program Output: `n // 2 * b + a` = `5 // 2 * 11 + 5` = `2 * 11 + 5` = `27`.
  - Expected Output: `2 * 11 + 5` = `27`.
- **Case 3:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9` (odd `n`), `2 * a < b` is true.
  - Program Output: `a * n` = `5 * 5` = `25`.
  - Expected Output: `25`.

The program correctly handles these scenarios as well.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for all provided scenarios, including the example mentioned in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
