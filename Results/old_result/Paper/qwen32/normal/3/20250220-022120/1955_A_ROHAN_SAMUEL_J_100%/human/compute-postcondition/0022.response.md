Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations.**

The postcondition reflects that the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged after the if-else block, and the loop will continue to run for the specified number of iterations.
