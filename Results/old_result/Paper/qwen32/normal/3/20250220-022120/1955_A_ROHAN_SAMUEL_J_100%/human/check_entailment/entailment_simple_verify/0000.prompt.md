You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the next t lines contains three integers n, a, and b, where 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were read from the input. Depending on whether `n` is odd or even and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`, the output was either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a` (for odd `n` when `2 * a >= b`) or `n // 2 * b` (for even `n` when `2 * a >= b`). The final output state is the result of all these individual outputs for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code provided does not correctly handle all cases where the promotion price is cheaper than buying individual yogurts. Specifically, the code does not account for the scenario where the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.

Let's analyze the code:
- If `n` is odd, the code checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually). If false, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the last yogurt individually).
- If `n` is even, the code checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually). If false, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts as pairs at the promotion price).

However, if `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, the code still calculates the cost as `a * n`, which might not be optimal if buying pairs and one yogurt separately is cheaper.

For example, consider the case:
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- The code calculates the cost as `3 * 5 = 15` because `2 * 5 < 11` is false.
- However, the optimal cost is `11 + 5 = 16` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt individually).

In this case, the code does not produce the minimum cost, hence it is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
