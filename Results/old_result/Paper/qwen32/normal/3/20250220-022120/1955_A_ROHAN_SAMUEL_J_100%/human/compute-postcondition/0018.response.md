Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- There are specific conditions based on whether `n` is odd or even, but these conditions do not directly affect the `print` statement in the provided code snippet.
- The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations, but this does not affect the current `print` statement as it is outside the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b + a)
```

### Analysis:
- `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- `n // 2 * b` multiplies the result of `n // 2` by `b`.
- `n // 2 * b + a` adds `a` to the result of `n // 2 * b`.

### Output Description:
The output of the `print` statement is the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`. Given the initial state, we know the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, but they are not explicitly provided in the problem statement. Therefore, we will describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n, a, and b are integers read from the input)**
