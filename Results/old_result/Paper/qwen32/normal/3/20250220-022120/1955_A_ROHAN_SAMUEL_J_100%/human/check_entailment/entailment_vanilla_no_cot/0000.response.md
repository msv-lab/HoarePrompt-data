Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts `b`. It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

Here's the breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. If `n` is odd:
   - It checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`, which means buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and paying the regular price for the last yogurt.

2. If `n` is even:
   - It again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

The logic seems correct, but let's consider the edge cases:

- If `n = 1`, the cost is simply `a` because there's no pair to buy.
- If `n = 2`, the cost is `min(2 * a, b)` because Maxim can either buy two yogurts individually or take advantage of the promotion.
- For larger `n`, the logic correctly calculates the cost by maximizing the number of pairs bought at the promotion price and handling the odd case appropriately.

The program handles all these cases correctly, and the logic is sound. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
