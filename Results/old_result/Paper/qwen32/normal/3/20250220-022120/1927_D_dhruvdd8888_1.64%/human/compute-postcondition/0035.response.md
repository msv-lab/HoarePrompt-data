Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `final_num`; `s` is `final_s`; `e` is 0; `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged; `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. Additionally, `tc` is greater than 5.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The program simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if there is no loop. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
