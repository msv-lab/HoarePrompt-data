Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`N`**: The first integer read from the input. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
3. **`nums`**: A list of integers where:
   - `nums[0]` is `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - `nums[-1]` is `-1`. This is a sentinel value not used in the print statement.
4. **`num`**: This variable is `final_num`. However, it is not used in the print statement.
5. **`arr`**: A list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`. Each tuple `(x, y, z)` in `arr` represents a sequence of `x` repeated `y` times, starting at index `z` in `nums`.
6. **`LA`**: `len(arr) - 1`. This represents the last index of the list `arr`.
7. **`ppp`**: If `ppp` is equal to 23, it remains equal to 23. This variable is not used in the print statement.
8. **`l` and `r`**: These are two integers read from the input. They are not directly used in the print statement.
9. **`tc`**: If `tc` is greater than 5, it is greater than 5. This variable is not used in the print statement.
10. **`eli`**: The insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`. This is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
11. **`s` and `e`**: These are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. `s` represents the number in the sequence, and `e` represents the count of that number in the sequence.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```
- **`s`**: This is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. It represents the number in the sequence.
- **`e + 1`**: This is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` plus one. It represents the count of that number in the sequence plus one.

### Output Explanation:
The output will be the number `s` followed by the count of that number in the sequence plus one. The exact values of `s` and `e` depend on the input and the structure of `arr`, but based on the given information, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the number in the sequence and e + 1 is the count of that number in the sequence plus one)**
