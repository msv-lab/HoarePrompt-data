Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `final_num`; `s` is `final_s`; `e` is 0; `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
