The code appends `-1` to the `nums` list. Therefore, the `nums` list now includes an additional element `-1` at the end. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `n`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `arr` is an empty list.**
