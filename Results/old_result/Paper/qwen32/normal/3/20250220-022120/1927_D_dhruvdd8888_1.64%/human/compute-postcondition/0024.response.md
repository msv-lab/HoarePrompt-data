To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the loop's behavior and how it affects the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates `N + 1` times.
- `num` keeps track of the current number being processed in `nums`.
- `s` keeps track of the starting index of the current sequence of identical numbers.
- `arr` stores tuples of the form `(start_index, end_index, number)`, representing sequences of identical numbers.

### Iteration Details:
- If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` is appended to `arr`, and `s` is updated to `i`.
- `num` is updated to `nums[i]` in every iteration.

### Final State:
- The loop processes all elements in `nums` up to `nums[N]`.
- After the loop, `arr` will contain all the sequences of identical numbers found in `nums`.
- `s` will be the starting index of the last sequence.
- `num` will be the last number processed, which is `nums[N]`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `N` remains unchanged as it is the input parameter.
- `nums` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
- `num` will be `nums[N]` after the loop.
- `s` will be the starting index of the last sequence.
- `e` remains `0` as it is not modified in the loop.
- `arr` will contain all the sequences of identical numbers found in `nums`.

### Calculation of `s`:
- `s` will be the index where the last change in `num` occurred. If no change occurred after the last sequence, `s` will be the starting index of that last sequence.

### Final Output State:
- `arr` will contain tuples representing all sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `num` will be the last element processed, which is `nums[N]`.
- `s` will be the starting index of the last sequence of identical numbers.

### Conclusion:
Let's denote the final value of `s` after the loop has finished as `final_s` and the final value of `num` as `final_num`. The output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `final_num`; `s` is `final_s`; `e` is 0; `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.**
