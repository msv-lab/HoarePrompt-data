The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `arr`. None of the other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `num`, `s`, `e`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:]` is the list `a` of `n` integers; `num` is `n`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `arr` is an empty list.**
