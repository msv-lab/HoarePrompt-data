The code snippet `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a tuple to the list `arr`. Here, the tuple consists of three elements: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. The initial state specifies that `s` is 0, so `1 + s` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `num` are not specified but remain unchanged by this operation. The list `arr` is initially empty and will now contain one tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `n`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `arr` is `[(1, i, num)]`.**
