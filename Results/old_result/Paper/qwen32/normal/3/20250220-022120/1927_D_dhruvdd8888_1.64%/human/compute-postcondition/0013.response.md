The code snippet `num = nums[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `num` was previously dependent on `nums[i]`. Since `num` was initially set to `n` (which is `nums[0]`), the new value of `num` will be the value at the `i`-th index of `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `nums[i]`; If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is set to `i`, `e` is set to 0, and `arr` is `[(1, i, num)]`. Otherwise, `s` and `e` remain 0, and `arr` remains an empty list.**
