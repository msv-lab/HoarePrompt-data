Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`N`**: The first integer read from the input.
3. **`nums`**: A list of integers where:
   - `nums[0]` is `n`.
   - `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - `nums[-1]` is `-1`.
4. **`num`**: This is `final_num`, but its exact value is not provided.
5. **`arr`**: A list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
6. **`LA`**: `len(arr) - 1`.
7. **`ppp`**: If `ppp` is equal to 23, then it remains 23. However, the initial value of `ppp` is not provided.
8. **`l` and `r`**: These are two integers read from the input.
9. **`tc`**: If `tc` is greater than 5, then it is greater than 5. However, the initial value of `tc` is not provided.
10. **`eli`**: The insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
11. **`s` and `e`**: The first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
12. **`l` and `r`**: These are updated to the values read from the input.

### Key Points to Note
- The variables `l` and `r` are read from the input and then potentially updated. However, the problem does not specify any updates to `l` and `r` after their initial reading. Therefore, the values of `l` and `r` printed will be the values read from the input.
- The exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe them as the values read from the input.

### Conclusion
The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r` as they were read from the input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the values read from the input)**
