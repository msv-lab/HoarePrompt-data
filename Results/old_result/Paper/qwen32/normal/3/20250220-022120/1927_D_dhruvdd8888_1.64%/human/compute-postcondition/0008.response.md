The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over is `N + 1`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `N`. The value of `N` determines how many times the loop will execute. If `N` is at least 0, the loop will execute at least once because `range(N + 1)` will include 0 as its first value.

Here are the steps to ensure the loop executes:

1. **Ensure `N` is at least 0**: This guarantees that the loop will run at least once.
2. **Adjust `i`**: Since `i` is the loop variable and it is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, we don't need to adjust it before the loop starts.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure `N` is at least 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `n`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `arr` is an empty list**
