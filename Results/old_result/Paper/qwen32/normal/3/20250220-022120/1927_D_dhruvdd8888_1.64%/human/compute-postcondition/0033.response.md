To determine what will be printed by the `print(l, r)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided.

The initial state includes the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` is the first integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n`, `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`.
- `num` is `final_num`.
- `s` is `final_s`.
- `e` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `ppp` is equal to 23.
- `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.
- Additionally, `tc` is greater than 5.

From the initial state, we see that `l` and `r` are explicitly mentioned as integers read from the input. The exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, but we know they are integers.

Given this information, the `print(l, r)` statement will output the values of `l` and `r` as they were read from the input.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `l` and `r` separated by a space.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the two integers read from the input)**
