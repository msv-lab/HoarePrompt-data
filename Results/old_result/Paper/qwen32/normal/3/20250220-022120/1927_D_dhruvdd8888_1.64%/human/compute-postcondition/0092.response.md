Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function outputs a pair of indices based on the sequence of identical numbers within that range. The function does not return a value explicitly but prints the results of each query.**
