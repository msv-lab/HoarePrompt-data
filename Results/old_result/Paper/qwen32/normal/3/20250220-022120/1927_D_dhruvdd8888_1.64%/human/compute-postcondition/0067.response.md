The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the two integers `-1` and `-1`.

Let's break down the given initial state for clarity, even though it's not necessary for determining the output of this specific print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `N` is the first integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n`, `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`.
- `num` is `final_num`.
- `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23.
- `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input.
- If `tc` is greater than 5, then `tc` is greater than 5.
- `eli` is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
- `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The next input should specify one less iteration.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output is straightforward.

Output: **-1, -1**
