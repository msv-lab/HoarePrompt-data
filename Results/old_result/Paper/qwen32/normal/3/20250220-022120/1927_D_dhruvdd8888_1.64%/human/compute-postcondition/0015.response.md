The code snippet appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple consists of three elements: `(1 + s, i, num)`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1` in the initial state, but the code snippet itself does not change `i`; it only uses the current value of `i`.

Given this, the list `arr` will have a new tuple added to it, and the value of `i` remains unchanged in the output state as per the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it.**
