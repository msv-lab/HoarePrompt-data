Let's break down the given information to determine what will be printed by the `print(s - 1, s)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers where:
     - `nums[0]` is `n`.
     - `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers.
     - `nums[-1]` is `-1`.
   - `num` is `final_num`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `ppp` is set to 23 if it equals 23.
   - `l` and `r` are two integers read from the input.
   - `tc` is greater than 5 if it is indeed greater than 5.
   - `eli` is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

2. **Relevant Variables for the Print Statement:**
   - `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` is the starting index of a sequence of identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `e` is the length of that sequence.

### Determining the Output:

- The `print(s - 1, s)` statement will print `s - 1` followed by `s`.
- The value of `s` is the starting index of a sequence of identical numbers in `nums`.
- Since `s` is the starting index, `s - 1` will be the index just before the start of this sequence.

### Final Output Description:

Given the information, we know that `s` is the starting index of a sequence of identical numbers in `nums`. Therefore, `s - 1` will be the index just before this sequence starts.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the starting index of a sequence of identical numbers in nums)**
