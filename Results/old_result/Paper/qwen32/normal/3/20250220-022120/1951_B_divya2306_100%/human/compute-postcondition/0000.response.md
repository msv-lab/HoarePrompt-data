The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The list `a` of `n` integers is also mentioned but is not affected by this code snippet.

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The other variables, `t` and `a`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct.**
