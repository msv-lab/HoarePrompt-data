Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct, `wins` is less than k - 2, `win_with_swap` is wins + 4, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without modification to the variables.**

In simpler terms, the value of `win_with_swap` has been incremented by 1, making it `wins + 4`. The value of `i` has also been updated to `win_with_swap + 2`, which is now `wins + 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
