To determine what will be printed by the `print(wins - 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct.
- `wins` is at least `k`.

Given these conditions, the value of `wins` is at least `k`, but we do not have an explicit value for `wins`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `wins`.

The print statement `print(wins - 1)` will output the value of `wins` minus 1. Since `wins` is at least `k`, `wins - 1` will be at least `k - 1`.

Thus, the output of the print statement will be `wins - 1`, where `wins` is a value that is at least `k`.

Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is at least k)**
