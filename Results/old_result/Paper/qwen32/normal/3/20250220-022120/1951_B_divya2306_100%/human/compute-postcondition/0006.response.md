Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct; `wins` is 0. If the current element `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
