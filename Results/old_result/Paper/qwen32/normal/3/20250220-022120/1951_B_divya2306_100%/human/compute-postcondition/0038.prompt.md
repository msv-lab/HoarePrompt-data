You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct; `wins` is n.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is at least k)
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None) because the return statement is empty.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct; `wins` is less than k.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct, `wins` is less than k - 1, `win_with_swap` is k - 1.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: k - wins - 2 + (wins != 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value (returns `None`).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing (None) because the return statement is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
