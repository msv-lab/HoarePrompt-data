Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `j` is `j + 1`, `count2` is 0, `count` retains its previous value, `done` retains its previous value, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we continue with the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
