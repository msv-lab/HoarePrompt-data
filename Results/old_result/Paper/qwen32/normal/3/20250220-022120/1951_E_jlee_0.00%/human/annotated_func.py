#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: t is 0; i is equal to the original value of t; all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of strings, each from a separate test case, and determines whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part. For each string, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the split parts if such a split exists; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
