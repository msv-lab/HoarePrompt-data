Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `j` is `j + 1`, `count2` retains its previous value if `count2 == count`, otherwise `count2` is set to 0 if `count` is not greater than 1, and `done` is set to True if `count` is greater than 1 or if `count2` is greater than `count`; otherwise, `done` retains its previous value, and `count` retains its previous value unless `count2 == count` and `count` is not greater than 1.**
