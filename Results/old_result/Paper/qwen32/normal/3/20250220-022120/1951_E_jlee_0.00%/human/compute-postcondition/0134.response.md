Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State and Given Information:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `string` is the user input.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
5. `x` is the first character of `string`.
6. `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
7. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged and `count` is set to `j`.
8. The `print('YES')` statement is executed.

### Analysis:
- The provided code snippet does not include the definitions or initial values of `j`, `count`, and `done`. However, the question asks us to determine what is printed based on the given information.
- The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `j`, `count`, `done`, or any other variable directly. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the `print('YES')` statement is executed without any conditions or dependencies on the variables `j`, `count`, or `done`, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
