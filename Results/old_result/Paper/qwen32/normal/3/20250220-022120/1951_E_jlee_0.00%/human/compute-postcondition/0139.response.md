Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged and `count` is set to `j`.**
