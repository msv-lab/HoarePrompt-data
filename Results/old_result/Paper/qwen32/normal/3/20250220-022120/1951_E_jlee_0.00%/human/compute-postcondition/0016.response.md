Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`, and if `n` is 1, `done` remains False; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string` (`s[-1]`), the condition is satisfied without any additional changes.**
