The code snippet `string = input()` will assign the value of the user input to the variable `string`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and this condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the new value of `string` and the unchanged condition for `t`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `string` is the user input.**
