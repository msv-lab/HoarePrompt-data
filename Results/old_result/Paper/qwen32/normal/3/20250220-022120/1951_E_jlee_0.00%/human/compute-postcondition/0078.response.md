Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `count2` is updated such that `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is set to 1. The current value of `count` remains greater than 0. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` or `done`.**
