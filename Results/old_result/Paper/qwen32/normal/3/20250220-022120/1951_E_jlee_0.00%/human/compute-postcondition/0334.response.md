Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`; `done` is True; `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`; `count` is greater than 0, indicating that there was a character in `s` different from `x` and `count` was set to the index of that character; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
