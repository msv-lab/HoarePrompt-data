Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, each of the next `t` lines contains a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

In simple terms, `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints about the strings `s` remain unchanged.
