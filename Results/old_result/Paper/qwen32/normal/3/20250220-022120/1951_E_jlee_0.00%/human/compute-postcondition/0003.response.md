The code converts the `string` variable into a list of its characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0. The `string` variable retains its initial value as it is only used to create the list `s`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`.**
