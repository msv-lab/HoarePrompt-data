Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`. If all characters in `s` are the same as `x`, then `s.count(x) == n`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even or the middle character of `s` (if `n` is odd) is equal to `x`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0. Additionally, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
