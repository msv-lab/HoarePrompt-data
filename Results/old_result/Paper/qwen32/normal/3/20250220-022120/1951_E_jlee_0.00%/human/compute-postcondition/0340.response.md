Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `string` is the new user input.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
4. `n` is at least 1.
5. `x` is the first character of the new `string`.
6. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
7. `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
8. `count2` equals `count`.
9. `i` is `i + 1`.
10. `count` is greater than 1, indicating that there was more than one character in `s` different from `x` and `count` was set to the index of the last such character.

### Analysis:
- `string` is the original input string.
- `s` is the list of characters of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is an index such that `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count` is the index of the last character in `s` that is different from `x`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Explanation:
- `string[:j - 1]` gives the substring of `string` from the beginning up to, but not including, the character at index `j - 1`.
- `string[j - 1:]` gives the substring of `string` from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is the index where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `string[:j - 1]` will be the substring before the character at index `j - 1`, and `string[j - 1:]` will be the substring starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end.

### Output:
The print statement will output two substrings:
1. The substring from the start of `string` to the character just before the character at index `j - 1`.
2. The substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:] (where string[:j - 1] is the substring from the start of string to the character just before the character at index j - 1, and string[j - 1:] is the substring from the character at index j - 1 to the end of string)**
