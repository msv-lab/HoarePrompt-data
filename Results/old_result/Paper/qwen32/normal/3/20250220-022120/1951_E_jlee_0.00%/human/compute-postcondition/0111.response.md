Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `count` is greater than 0, the following conditions apply: if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `done`.**
