The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is independent of the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The print statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `k` and their properties.
2. The `print(1)` statement is executed regardless of the values of these variables.
3. The value `1` is explicitly printed by the statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print(1)` statement is simply `1`.

Output: **1**
