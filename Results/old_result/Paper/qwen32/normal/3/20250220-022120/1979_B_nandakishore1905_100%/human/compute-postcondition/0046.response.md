To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while f & f - 1 != 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The condition `f & f - 1 != 0` checks whether `f` is not a power of two. If `f` is not a power of two, the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `f` remains such that it is not a power of two.

Let's analyze the variables involved:

1. `f` is defined as `f = k - 2*q`, where `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `q` is `2^(p-1)`, with `p` being the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.

2. `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of this string.

3. `q` is `2^(p-1)`, which is the largest power of two less than or equal to `f`.

Given that `f` is not a power of two at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `f` remains not a power of two after the next iteration. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot directly modify `f` within the loop, but we can adjust the variables that define `f` (`n`, `m`, and indirectly `k`).

To ensure `f` remains not a power of two, we need to make sure that `k - 2*q` does not become a power of two in the next iteration. Since `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `q` depends on the binary representation of `f`, we need to adjust `n` and `m` such that `k` remains such that `f` is not a power of two.

However, since the loop body is omitted, we can only adjust `n` and `m` in a way that `k` remains such that `f` is not a power of two. We can adjust `n` and `m` to ensure that their absolute difference `k` does not result in `f` being a power of two.

Let's assume `n` and `m` are adjusted such that `k` remains not a power of two. Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we can state that `n` and `m` need to be adjusted to ensure `k` is not a power of two.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` and `m` are integers such that their absolute difference `k` is not a power of two, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, `f` is `k - 2*q` and is not a power of two**
