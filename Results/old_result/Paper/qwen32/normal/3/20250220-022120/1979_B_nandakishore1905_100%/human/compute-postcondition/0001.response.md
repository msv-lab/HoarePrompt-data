The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers. However, these variables `x` and `y` are not used in the provided code snippet.

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` will be set to the two integers read from the input. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**
