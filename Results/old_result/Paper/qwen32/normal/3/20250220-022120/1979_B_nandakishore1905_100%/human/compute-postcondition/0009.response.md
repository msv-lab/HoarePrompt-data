The code snippet converts the integer `k` to its binary representation as a string, removing the '0b' prefix. The binary representation of `k` is stored in the variable `l`.

Given the initial state, `k` is an even integer that is not a power of 2. The binary representation of `k` will therefore have more than one '1' bit and will not be a single '1' followed by zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
