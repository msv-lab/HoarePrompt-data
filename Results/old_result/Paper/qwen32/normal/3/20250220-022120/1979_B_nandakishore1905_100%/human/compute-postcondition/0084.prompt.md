Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 2, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`. If `k` is a power of two, the state remains as described. If `k` is not a power of two, `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1` and is equal to `f`, and `f` is a power of two. If `k` is odd, the state remains as described; `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`. `f` is `k - q`.
Code of the loop:
while f & f - 1 != 0:
    l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
    p = len(l)
    q = 2 ** (p - 1)
    f = f - q


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 2, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is not a power of two, `f` is decreased by 2, `q` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 2, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is adjusted to be `f - 2^(p - 1)`, `q` is 2^(p - 1)
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 2, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of the adjusted `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is adjusted to be `f - 2^(p - 1)` such that `f` still has more than one bit set, `q` is 2^(p - 1), and `f` is now `f - q`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
