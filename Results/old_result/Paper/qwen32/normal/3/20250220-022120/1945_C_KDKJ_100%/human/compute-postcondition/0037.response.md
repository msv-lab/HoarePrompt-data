The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, and for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`S`, `ans`, `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`; `ans` is either -1 or the value of `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, `ans` remains -1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
