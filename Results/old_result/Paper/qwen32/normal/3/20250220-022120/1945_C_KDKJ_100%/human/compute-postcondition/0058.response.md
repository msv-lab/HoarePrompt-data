Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints the index `i` in the string `a` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions where the number of '0's up to index `i` is at least half of `i` and the number of '1's from index `i` to the end is at least half of the remaining length. If no such index exists, it prints `-1`.**
