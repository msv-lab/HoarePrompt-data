The code snippet provided updates the value of `rsum` to be `n - i`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y]; `ans` is `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `rsum` is now calculated as `n - i`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
