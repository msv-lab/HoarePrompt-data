### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the input values `n` (number of houses) and `a` (string of '0's and '1's).
   - It initializes a list `S` to keep track of cumulative counts of '0's and '1's. `S[i]` contains a list where `S[i][0]` is the number of '0's up to the `i`-th house, and `S[i][1]` is the number of '1's up to the `i`-th house.
   - It iterates through the string `a` to populate `S`.
   - It then iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road could be placed (from `0` to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's on the left (`left`) and the number of '1's on the right (`right`).
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left is at least half of the total houses on the left (`left * 2 >= i`) and if the number of '1's on the right is at least half of the total houses on the right (`right * 2 >= (n - i)`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if this position `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`n / 2`) than the previously found position. If so, it updates the answer `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the answer.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` `t` times, each time handling a separate test case.

### Correctness:
- The code correctly calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's using the list `S`.
- It checks the conditions for each possible position `i` where the road could be placed.
- It ensures that the position `i` is as close to the middle of the village as possible.
- It handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
