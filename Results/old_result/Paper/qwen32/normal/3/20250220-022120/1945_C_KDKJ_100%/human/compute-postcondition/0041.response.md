The code snippet provided updates the value of `rsum`. The new value of `rsum` is calculated as `n - i`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this update.

Given the initial state, `rsum` was defined as `n - i`. The code snippet recalculates `rsum` with the same formula, so effectively, `rsum` remains the same unless `i` has changed in the context of the code (which is not shown in the provided snippet). Since the task only includes this single line of code and no change to `i` is shown, `rsum` remains `n - i`.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`; `ans` is either -1 or the value of `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
