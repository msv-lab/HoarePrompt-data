In the provided task, the for loop iterates based on the value obtained from `int(input())`. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the underscore `_` is not a variable that can be adjusted and the loop's continuation depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to consider how `int(input())` is related to the state provided.

The state at the end of the previous iteration mentions that `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1. This suggests that `n` is related to the input value in some way. However, the loop does not directly use `n`; it uses the value obtained from `int(input())`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that the loop will execute again if the value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than the current iteration count. Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, we can ignore it for state modification.

Let's assume that the input to the function is `m`, and `m` is the value obtained from `int(input())`. According to the state, `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1. We need to ensure that `m` is greater than the current iteration count for the loop to execute again.

If we assume the loop has executed `k` times, then for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than `k`. Since `n` is related to the input in the provided state, we can infer that `m` should be `n + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1, the next state would be that `n` is now the new value obtained from `int(input())` minus 1, doubled and then decreased by 1 again.

However, since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head does not include `n`, we can simply state that the input to `int(input())` must be one more than the current iteration count.

State: **The input to the function must be a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1, and the next input to `int(input())` must be one more than the current iteration count.**
