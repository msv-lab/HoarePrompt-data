Postcondition: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in a; `ans` is -1 or the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. Additionally, `left * 2` is not less than `lsum` and `right * 2` is not less than `rsum`. The current value of `i` is such that the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.**
