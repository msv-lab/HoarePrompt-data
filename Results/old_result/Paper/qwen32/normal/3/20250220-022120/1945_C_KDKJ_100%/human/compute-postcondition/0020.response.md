The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Since `y` was part of the last element of `S`, that element now has its second value increased by 1. The other elements of `S` and the other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, `x`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string with at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y + 1]]`, `s` is the second character of `a`, `x` and `y` are the values of the last element of `S` before `y` was incremented.**
