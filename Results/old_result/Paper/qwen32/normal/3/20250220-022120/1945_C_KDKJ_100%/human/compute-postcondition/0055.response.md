To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` variable based on the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the range `n + 1`, and for each iteration `i`, it calculates `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum`. It then checks two conditions:
1. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, it continues to the next iteration without updating `ans`.
2. Otherwise, it updates `ans` to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.

The loop runs `n + 1` times, meaning it will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n`. The `ans` variable will be updated to the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the condition `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.

Given that the output states after the first 3 iterations provide the necessary information about how the loop updates `ans`, we can infer that by the end of the loop, `ans` will hold the value of `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the given conditions.

In natural language, the final state of the loop is that `ans` will be the index `i` in the range `[0, n]` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`. If no such `i` exists, `ans` will remain `-1`.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y]; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `ans` is the value of `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, or `-1` if no such `i` exists.**
