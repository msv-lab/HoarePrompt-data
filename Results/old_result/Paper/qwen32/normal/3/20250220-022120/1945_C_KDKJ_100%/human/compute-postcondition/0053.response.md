Postcondition: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y]; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `i` is `i + 1`. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
