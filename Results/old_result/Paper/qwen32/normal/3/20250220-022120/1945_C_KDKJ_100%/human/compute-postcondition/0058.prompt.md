You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of houses, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: S is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in a.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: `S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y]; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `ans` is the value of `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and meets the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, or `-1` if no such `i` exists.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the index i in the list S that is closest to n / 2 and meets the conditions left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum, or -1 if no such i exists)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns the number of times the substring "01" appears in the string `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
