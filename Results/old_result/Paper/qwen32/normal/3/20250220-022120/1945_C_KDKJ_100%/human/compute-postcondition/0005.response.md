To solve the problem, we need to understand the behavior of `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without the definition of `func_1()`, it is impossible to determine the exact changes it would make to the variables.

Since the function `func_1()` is not provided, I will assume that the function does not change the state of `n` or any other variable mentioned in the initial state. If `func_1()` does not modify `n` or introduce new variables, the output state would remain the same as the initial state.

Given the lack of specific operations within `func_1()`, the output state would be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The input to the function must be a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1, and the next input to `int(input())` must be one more than the current iteration count.**
