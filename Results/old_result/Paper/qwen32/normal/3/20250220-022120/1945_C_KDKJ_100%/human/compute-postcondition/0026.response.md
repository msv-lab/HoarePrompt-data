The code `left = S[i][0]` assigns the value of the first element of the `i`-th coordinate in the list `S` to the variable `left`. The other variables (`S`, `ans`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) are not affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the value of `S` is a list of coordinates starting from `[0, 0]` and ending with `[x, y]`. The value of `left` after the execution of the code will be the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in a; `ans` is -1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`.**
