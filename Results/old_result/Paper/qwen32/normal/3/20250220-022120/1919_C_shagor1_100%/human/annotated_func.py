#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the size of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It performs some computation or check on the array elements for each test case and returns a result based on the elements of the array.
