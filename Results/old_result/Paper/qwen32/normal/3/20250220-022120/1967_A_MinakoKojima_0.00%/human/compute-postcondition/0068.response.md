Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a[1]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n)`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` from it. The values of `n`, `i`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` remain unchanged.
