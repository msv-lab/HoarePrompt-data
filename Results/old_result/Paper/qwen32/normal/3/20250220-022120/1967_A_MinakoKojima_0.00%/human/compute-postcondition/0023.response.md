Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is 0 or less; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the formula `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a` before the updates; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`; `i` is 2; `ans` is `ans * (a[2] - a[1])`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying it with the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
