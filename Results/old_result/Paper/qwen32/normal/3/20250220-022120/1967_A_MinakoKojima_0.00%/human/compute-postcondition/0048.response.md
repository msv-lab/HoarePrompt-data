Output State: **`a` is updated such that `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `k` is the remaining value after all the updates; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to the product of its previous value and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. All other variables (`a`, `k`, `n`, and the specific values in `a`) remain as they were defined in the initial state, except for the updated `ans`.
