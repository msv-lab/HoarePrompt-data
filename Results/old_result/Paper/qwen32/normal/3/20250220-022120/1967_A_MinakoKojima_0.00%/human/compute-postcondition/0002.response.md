The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
