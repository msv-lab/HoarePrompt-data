The function will receive an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there will be two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. Following these integers, there will be a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
