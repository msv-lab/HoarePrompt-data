You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. Following these integers is a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

The program iterates over the dictionary `d` which contains the count of each difficulty level in the input string. For each difficulty level, it checks if the count is less than or equal to `m` and then adds `m - d[val]` to the answer `ans`. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't consider that each round requires a unique problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, the correct approach should be to determine how many of each required difficulty level are missing for `m` rounds, not just how many are missing compared to `m`.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
7 2
ABCDEFG
```
**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
**Actual Output:**
```
7
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
- Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') for one round.
- For two rounds, he needs two problems of each difficulty level.
- Since he has exactly one problem of each level, he needs one more problem of each level, totaling 7 additional problems.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of additional problems needed and outputs 7, which is incorrect because he actually needs 7 additional problems, not because the logic is flawed but because the program logic is not aligned with the problem requirements.

The correct approach should be to check how many of each required difficulty level are missing for `m` rounds and sum those values.

### Corrected Logic:
For each difficulty level 'A' to 'G', calculate `max(0, m - d[val])` and sum these values to get the correct answer.

The presence of the unused function `func_1()` does not affect the correctness of the program but is unnecessary and should be removed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
