The code snippet provided sets the variable `ans` to the value `1`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is 1; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.**
