To determine the output of the `print(*res)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand what the `res` list contains.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from a new input string.
- `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n - 1` elements are the results of some operations described in a loop, and the last element is `0`.
- `ans` is the result of dividing the initial product of all elements in `arr` by each element in `arr` exactly once, taken modulo `MOD`.
- `c` is `n`.
- `l` and `r` are equal to the middle index of `arr` if `n` is odd, or one of the middle indices if `n` is even.

### Analysis:
The `res` list contains `n` integers. The first `n - 1` elements are the results of some operations described in a loop, and the last element is `0`.

Since the exact operations performed in the loop are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the `res` list based on the information provided.

### Output:
The `print(*res)` statement will print all the elements of the `res` list, separated by spaces.

Given that the first `n - 1` elements are results of some operations and the last element is `0`, the output will be a series of integers ending with `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res[0] res[1] ... res[n-2] 0 (where res[i] for i in range(n-1) are the results of the operations in the loop)**
