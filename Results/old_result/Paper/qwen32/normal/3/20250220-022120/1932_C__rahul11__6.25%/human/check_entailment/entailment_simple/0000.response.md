Reasoning: The given annotated program is intended to solve the problem as described, but there are several issues in the implementation that would lead to incorrect results.

1. **Incorrect MOD usage**: The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` to take modulo, which is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem. The problem only requires taking modulo `m` for the final result, and dividing by array elements should not involve an additional modulo operation with `MOD`.

2. **Incorrect division**: The program attempts to divide the product by the removed element using integer division (`ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD`), which is not mathematically valid when considering remainders. Instead, the product should be multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of the removed element.

3. **Handling of the first element**: The first element of the result array `res` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, which is incorrect as it should be `ans % m`.

4. **Final element of the result array**: The last element of the result array `res` is set to `0` by default, which is not computed correctly. It should be the result of the last operation before the array becomes empty.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
