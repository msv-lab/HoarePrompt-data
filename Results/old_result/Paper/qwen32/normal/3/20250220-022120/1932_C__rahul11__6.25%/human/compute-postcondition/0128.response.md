The code snippet provided is `l += 1`, which increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`, `k`, `ans`) are not modified by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the `c`-th element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, and `l` is incremented by 1.**
