The code snippet `c = 1` updates the value of the variable `c` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is 1; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`.**
