The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `n - 1`. After the decrement, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 2`; `s[k]` is not equal to 'L'.**
