The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements in `arr`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `arr`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0
- `ans` is `ans * i`
- `c` is `n`
- `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`
- `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`

Since `i` is the loop variable and it takes on each value in `arr` one by one, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `arr` after the current one.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `i` was `arr[j]` for some index `j`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `arr[j + 1]`, provided `j + 1` is a valid index in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `ans` is `ans * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`, `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`, and `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one**.

However, since we do not know the exact current index `j` of `i` in `arr`, we can represent the next state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `ans` is `ans * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`, `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`, and `i` is `arr[j + 1]` where `j` is the index of the current `i` in `arr`**.

Since we need to specify a concrete state, let's assume that in the previous iteration, `i` was `arr[0]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `arr[1]` if `arr` has more than one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `ans` is `ans * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`, `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`, and `i` is `arr[1]`**.

If `arr` has only one element, the loop will not execute again, so we do not need to adjust the state further in that case.
