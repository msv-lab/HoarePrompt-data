The code snippet increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables `k`, `ans`, and `res[c]` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `k` is `i + 1`, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, and `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`. Since only `l` is modified, the new state reflects this change.

Output State: **`k` is `i + 1`; `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`; `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`; `l` is `l + 1`**.
