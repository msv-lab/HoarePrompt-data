You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing commands 'L' or 'R'.
   - We need to process each command in order, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` modulo `m` before each command, and then remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - For each command:
     - Output the product of the current array modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element.
     - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases).
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5` (length of the array).
   - `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4` (modulus).
   - `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4` (elements of the array).
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `MOD` to `10^9 + 6`, which is not necessary for the problem as we only need to take modulo `m` for the final output.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s`.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - It calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then calculates the remainder of `ans` modulo `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.

4. **Processing Commands**:
   - It initializes `c = 1` to keep track of the current position in `res`.
   - It initializes `l = 0` and `r = n - 1` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array.
   - For each command in `s` (except the last one):
     - If the command is 'L', it updates `ans` by removing the leftmost element and then calculates the remainder of `ans` modulo `m` and stores it in `res[c]`.
     - If the command is 'R', it updates `ans` by removing the rightmost element and then calculates the remainder of `ans` modulo `m` and stores it in `res[c]`.
     - It increments `c` to move to the next position in `res`.
     - It adjusts `l` or `r` accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all commands for a test case, it prints the array `res`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Division**:
  - The program uses integer division `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` to remove an element from the product. However, integer division is not the correct way to remove an element from a product. Instead, it should use multiplication by the modular inverse.
  - The modular inverse of a number `x` modulo `m` is a number `y` such that `(x * y) % m = 1`. Multiplying by the modular inverse effectively removes the element from the product modulo `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses integer division to remove elements from the product, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to use the modular inverse of the element to be removed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
