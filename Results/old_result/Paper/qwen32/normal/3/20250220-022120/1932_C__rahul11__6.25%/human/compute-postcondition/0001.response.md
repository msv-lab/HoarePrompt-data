The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute if the input provided to `int(input())` is at least 1. The state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `MOD` does not directly influence whether the loop can execute, as they are not part of the loop head.

To ensure the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Therefore, `t` (which represents the number of test cases) must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
