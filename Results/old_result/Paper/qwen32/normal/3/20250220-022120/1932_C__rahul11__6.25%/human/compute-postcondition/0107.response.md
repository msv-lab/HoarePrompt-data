The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over `arr`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current element being processed from `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `arr`.

Given that `arr` is a new list of integers with at least one element and `i` is the next element in `arr`, we can infer that `i` should be updated to the subsequent element in `arr` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers with at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i^2`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. `i` is the next element in `arr`.** 

Since `i` is the loop variable and it's currently the last processed element, for the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `arr`. However, without knowing the exact position of the current `i` in `arr`, we can only describe the state in terms of `i` being the next element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers with at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i^2`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

To be more precise, if `i` was the `k`-th element in `arr` during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in `arr`. However, since we don't have the exact position, we keep it as the next element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers with at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i^2`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

Since the loop variable `i` is the only one that can be adjusted and it should be the next element in `arr`, we can conclude:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers with at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `i^2`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
