Let's analyze the provided Python program to see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
1. The sum of these integers equals `k`.
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that is supposed to generate the required sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach used in the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - An array `nums` of size `n` is initialized with all elements set to `0`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the program sets `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` (or fewer if `k` is a power of 2), but with all bits set to `1`.
   - The value of `k` is then reduced by `nums[i]`.

3. **Adjusting the Last Element**:
   - After the loop, the last element of `nums` is adjusted by adding the remaining `k` to it.

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns the array `nums`.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**: The approach does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the numbers. Instead, it sets each number to the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k`, which is not optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the OR result.
- **Handling of Remaining Sum**: The program does not ensure that the sum of the numbers equals `k` in an optimal way for maximizing the number of 1s in the OR result.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `k` is very small or where `n` is very large relative to `k`.

### Example:
Consider the test case `n=2` and `k=5`:
- The program would set `nums[0]` to `3` (which is `11` in binary) and then reduce `k` by `3` to `2`.
- It would then set `nums[1]` to `3` again, but since `k` is only `2`, it would correct `nums[1]` to `2` (which is `10` in binary).
- The result would be `nums = [3, 2]`, and the bitwise OR would be `3 | 2 = 3` (which is `11` in binary, having 2 ones).
- However, a better solution would be `[5, 0]` or `[4, 1]`, both of which also have a bitwise OR of `5` (which is `101` in binary, having 2 ones), but the optimal solution would be `[3, 2]` or `[2, 3]` to achieve the same result. However, the optimal solution to maximize the number of 1s in the OR result would be `[1, 4]` or `[4, 1]`, which results in `101` in binary (3 ones).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. It fails to provide an optimal solution for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
