Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence, but it does so incorrectly.

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
```

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `nums[i]`:**
   - The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` calculates the largest number with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits set to 1. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), `k.bit_length()` is 3, so `(1 << 3 - 1) - 1` is `3` (binary `11`).
   - This value is then assigned to each element of the array `nums` until `k` is exhausted. This approach does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Handling of Remaining `k`:**
   - After the loop, the remaining `k` is added to the last element of the array `nums`. This step does not ensure that the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.

### Correct Approach:

To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, we should distribute the value `k` in such a way that the resulting numbers have as many 1s as possible in their binary representation. One way to achieve this is to use the largest possible powers of 2 to sum up to `k`.

Here is an example of a correct approach:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    i = 0
    while k > 0:
        if i < n:
            nums[i] = min(k, 1 << (k.bit_length() - 1))
            k -= nums[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            break
    return nums

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))
```

In this corrected version, we try to use the largest possible powers of 2 to sum up to `k` while filling the array `nums`. This approach ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence, hence it is incorrect.
