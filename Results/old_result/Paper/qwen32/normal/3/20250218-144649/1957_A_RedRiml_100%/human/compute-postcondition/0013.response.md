The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Therefore, `pl` will now include the value of `i` as its last element. The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list containing the elements it originally had plus `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. The current value of `i` is now in `pl`. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, `d` now contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, `d` already contains the key `i` and the value associated with `i` is incremented by 1.**
