The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least one more element after the current `j`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first element in `pl`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next element in `pl`.

State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the new input, `pl` is a list of all unique integers from `palka` and has at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `palka` and values as their respective counts, `j` is the second element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.**
