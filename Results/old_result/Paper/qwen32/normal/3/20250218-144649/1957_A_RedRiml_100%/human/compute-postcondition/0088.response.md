The code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that after the execution, `d` will have a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`.

The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{i: 1}`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
