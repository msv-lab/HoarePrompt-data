The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d[i]` to `1`. This means that if `i` was not already a key in the dictionary `d`, it will now be added with the value `1`. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, `d.get(i)` was either `None` or some integer. Since the code sets `d[i]` to `1`, the new value of `d[i]` is `1`. The other parts of the state, such as `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `shapes`, remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is now `1`, `pl` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is the next element in `palka`**.
