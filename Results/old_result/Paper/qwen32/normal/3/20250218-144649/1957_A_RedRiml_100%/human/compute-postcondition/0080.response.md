Let's break down the given initial state and the `print` statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **w**: An integer between 0 and 99 inclusive. (Not directly used in the `print` statement, so its value is not relevant here.)
2. **ln**: The input integer, which represents the number of integers in the list `palka`.
3. **palka**: A list of integers, with `ln` elements.
4. **pl**: A list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
5. **d**: A dictionary where the keys are the unique integers from `palka` and the values are the counts of each integer in `palka`.
6. **shapes**: The sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

### Calculation of `shapes`:
- For each unique integer `j` in `pl`, if the count `d[j]` is 3 or more, `d[j] // 3` is added to `shapes`.
- This means `shapes` counts how many groups of 3 each unique integer appears in `palka`.

### Print Statement:
The `print(shapes)` statement will output the value of `shapes`.

### Output Description:
The value of `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, considering only those counts that are 3 or more.

### Final Output:
Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**

This output precisely describes the value of `shapes` based on the given initial state and the formula used to calculate it.
