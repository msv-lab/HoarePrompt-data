Postcondition: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` contains the element `i` twice. If `i` was not in `d` initially, `d` contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, no changes are made to `pl` or `d`.**
