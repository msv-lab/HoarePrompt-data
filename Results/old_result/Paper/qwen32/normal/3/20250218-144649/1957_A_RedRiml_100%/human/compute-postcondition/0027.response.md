Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, `pl` will contain all the unique numbers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` will tell you how many times each number from `palka` appears. The values of `w` and `ln` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
