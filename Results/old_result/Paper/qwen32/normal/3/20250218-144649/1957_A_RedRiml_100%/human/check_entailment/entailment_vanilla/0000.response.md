Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons (equal-sided) that can be formed using given sticks, where each polygon must have at least 3 sides and no stick can be reused.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It also initializes an empty list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.
   - For each stick length `i` in `palka`, it updates the count in `d` and adds the length to `pl` if it hasn't been added yet.

3. **Calculating Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - It initializes a variable `shapes` to count the maximum number of polygons.
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, it checks if the count of sticks of length `j` (`d[j]`) is at least 3.
   - If so, it adds the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to `shapes`. This is because a polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `shapes`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Handling Small Numbers of Sticks:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks by not adding to `shapes` (since `d[j] < 3`).

- **Counting Polygons:**
  - The program correctly counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 and summing these values.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where there are multiple stick lengths and multiple polygons can be formed (as seen in the fourth test case of the example).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts stick frequencies using a dictionary and processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of sticks.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
