The code provided is `d[i] += 1`. This line increments the value of the element at index `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive
- `ln` is the new input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer
- `i` is the next element in `palka`

The only variable that changes is the value of `d[i]` in the dictionary `d`, which is incremented by 1. The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
