To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations step by step.

1. **Variable `w`**: It is mentioned that `w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive. However, `w` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the value of `shapes`.

2. **Variable `ln`**: This is an input integer. It represents the number of elements in the `palka` list.

3. **List `palka`**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input. The exact values are not provided, but we know that the length of this list is `ln`.

4. **List `pl`**: This list contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. Essentially, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`.

5. **Dictionary `d`**: This dictionary maps each unique integer from `palka` to the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. So, for each integer `j` in `pl`, `d[j]` is the number of times `j` appears in `palka`.

6. **Variable `shapes`**: This is calculated as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. In simpler terms, for each unique integer `j` in `palka`, if it appears at least 3 times, we add the integer division of its count by 3 to `shapes`.

Given this information, the `print(shapes)` statement will output the calculated value of `shapes`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each integer in `palka` by 3, but only for those integers that appear at least 3 times.

Since the exact values of `palka` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**
