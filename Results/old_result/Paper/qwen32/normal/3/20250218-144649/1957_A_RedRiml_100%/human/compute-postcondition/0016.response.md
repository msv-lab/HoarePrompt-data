The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to `1`. This means that if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is overwritten to `1`. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value `1`.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i` (if `i` was not in `pl` initially, it is now added), and `d` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with the value `1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `i` in the dictionary `d` is now `1`, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
