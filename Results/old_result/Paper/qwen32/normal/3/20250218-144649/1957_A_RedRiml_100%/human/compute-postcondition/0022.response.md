The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of key `i` in the dictionary `d` to `1`. This means if `i` was not already a key in `d`, it will be added with the value `1`. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, `d` might have contained the key `i` with some value, which will be changed to `1` by this assignment. All other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list that contains the element `i`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` having the value `1`.**
