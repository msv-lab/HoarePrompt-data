Postcondition: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` if it was `None` before, or incremented by `1` if it was already present, `pl` contains the current value of `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i`.**
