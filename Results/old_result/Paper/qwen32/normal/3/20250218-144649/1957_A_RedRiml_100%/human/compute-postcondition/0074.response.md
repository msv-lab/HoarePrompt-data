The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by the integer division of the count of the current element `j` in the dictionary `d` by 3. 

Given the initial state, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`, where `d[j]` is the count of the integer `j` in the list `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged, `j` is the next element in `pl`. The value of `shapes` has been updated by adding `d[j] // 3` to it.**
