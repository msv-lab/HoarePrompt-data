The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to `1`. This means that if `i` was not already a key in `d`, it is now added with the value `1`. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, the only change that occurs is to the dictionary `d`. The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` having the value `1`, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element if it did not already.**
