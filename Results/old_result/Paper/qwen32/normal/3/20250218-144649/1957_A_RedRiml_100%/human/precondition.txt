test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is represented as a tuple (n, sticks). n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and sticks is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 100, inclusive.
