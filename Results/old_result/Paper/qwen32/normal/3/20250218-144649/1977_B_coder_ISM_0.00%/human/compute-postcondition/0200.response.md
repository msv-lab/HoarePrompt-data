Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list of 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'`. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[0]` was `'1'` and `s[1]` was also `'1'`, then `flag` is now 1 and `s[0]` is `'-1'`. Otherwise, `s[0]` is `'0'` if `flag` is 1, otherwise it is `'1'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is not set. `i` is 0.**
