Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 strings where `s[2]` is `'-1'`, `i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is `'0'` if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[0]` was `'0'`, or `'1'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is not set, `s[1]` is `'0'` if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[1]` was `'0'`, otherwise `'1'`, and all other `s[j]` for `j` from 3 to 29 remain either `'1'` or `'0'`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `flag` has been set to 1. The values of `t`, `x`, `nalla`, `length`, `s[2]`, `i`, and the elements of `s` from index 3 to 29 remain unchanged. The values of `s[0]` and `s[1]` may have changed based on the initial conditions of `flag` and `x`.
