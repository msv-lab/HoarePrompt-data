Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, and `length` is 30.**

In simple terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 characters ('1' or '0'), representing the binary form of the integer `x` from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the 30th bit (leftmost). The values of `t` and `length` remain unchanged.
