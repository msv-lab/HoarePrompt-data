Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then the second string in `s` is '1' and the rest are either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is now '-1' and the rest of `s` remains either '1', '0', or '-1'. `length` remains 30. `nalla` is incremented by 1 if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', otherwise `nalla` remains unchanged. `i` remains 1. `flag` is set to 0 if it was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', or if `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` equals `s[i + 1]`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.**
