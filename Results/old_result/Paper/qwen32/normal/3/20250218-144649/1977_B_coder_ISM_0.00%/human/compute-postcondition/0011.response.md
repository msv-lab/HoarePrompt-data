The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `30`, so we can only adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `30`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between `0` and `29` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `x` is an input integer
- `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not
- `length` is 30

Since only `i` can be adjusted, and `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, we adjust `i` to `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and `length` is 30, `i` is `i + 1`**
