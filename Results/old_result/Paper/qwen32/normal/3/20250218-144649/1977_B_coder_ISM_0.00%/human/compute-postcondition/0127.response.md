Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1' depending on the initial conditions. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then the second string in `s` is '1' and the rest are either '1', '0', or '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. `length` remains 30, `nalla` is `nalla + 1` if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', otherwise `nalla` remains unchanged. `i` remains 1, and `flag` is set to 0 if it was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0'; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged as per the initial conditions.**
