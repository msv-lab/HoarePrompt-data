Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` is a list of 30 strings. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i - 1]` is updated to `'-1'`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. `length` is at least 2.**
