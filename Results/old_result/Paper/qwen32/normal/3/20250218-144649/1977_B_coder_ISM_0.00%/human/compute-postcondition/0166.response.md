Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is either 30 or 31, and `s` is a list of strings where no '1' is immediately followed by a '-1'**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to be an input integer. The other variables (`t`, `flag`, `nalla`, `length`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
