Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not. `flag` is 0, `i` is 0. Either `flag` is not 1, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not `'1'`.**
