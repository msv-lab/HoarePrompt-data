Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is unchanged, `length` is greater than 3, and `i` is 3. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the element at index 2 in `s` is now '-1', and all other elements remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
