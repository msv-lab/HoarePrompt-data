Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each `'1'` that was part of a consecutive pair of `'1'`s has been replaced by `'-1'`, the next `'0'` after such a pair has been replaced by `'1'`, and all other `'1'`s that are not part of such pairs remain `'1'`, `flag` is 1, and `s[29]` is `'1'`.**

In simple terms, the value of `s[29]` has been changed from `'0'` to `'1'`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
