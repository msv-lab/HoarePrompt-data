The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is a command that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, `s`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string. If `s` is equal to '<', `pans` is `[None]`. If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list containing one element `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
