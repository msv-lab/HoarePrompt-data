The code attempts to append the variable `i` to the list `pans`. However, `i` is not set to any specific value in the initial state, which means this operation would result in a `NameError` in a real Python environment. Since the task requires us to simulate the execution and provide an output state, we will assume the intention was to append a value to `pans` even though `i` is undefined. For the sake of this simulation, let's assume `i` was intended to be a specific value or was set to `None` before this line, as the exact value of `i` is not specified.

Given the initial state, the only change will be to `pans` which will now contain one element, `i`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing one element `i`, `i` is not set, `s` is the input string, `s` is equal to '='**
