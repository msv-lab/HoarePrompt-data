To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their initial states:**
   - `t` is at least 0 (no specific value given, but it's non-negative).
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (no specific value given, but it's greater than 1).
   - `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`. Since `mak` is initially set to 0 and there is no information suggesting `mak` changes, `mak2` is also 0.
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`. However, the input string `s` is not provided, so we can only describe `pans` based on the given conditions.
   - `mak` is initially set to 0.

2. **Print statement analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`.
   - `mak` is 0, so `mak` will be printed twice.
   - `i` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. Since `pans` contains indices from the string `s`, `i` could be any index from `pans`. However, without the exact string `s`, we can't determine the exact value of `i`.

Given the information, we can provide a precise description of the printed output:

- The first argument to the `print` statement is a literal `?`.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`, which is an index from the list `pans`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its origin from `pans`.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an index from the list pans)**
