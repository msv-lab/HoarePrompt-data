Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Explanation:
1. **`t` (number of test cases)**: At least 1.
2. **`n`**: Greater than `i + 1`.
3. **`mak`**: Set to `i` if the current input is the string `'<'`; otherwise, it remains 0.
4. **`i`**: Initially `i` is 0 (since it is incremented in each iteration), and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Assume `i` starts at 0.
   - `mak` is initially 0 unless the input is `'<'`.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - If the input is `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i` (which is 0).
   - If the input is not `'<'`, `mak` remains 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent iteration, `mak` is set to `i` if the input is `'<'`; otherwise, it remains 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Output:
The print statement will output `?, mak, mak, i, i`. The value of `mak` depends on the input, and `i` is the current iteration number.

Given the initial state and the print statement, let's consider the first iteration for the output:
- If the input is `'<'`:
  - `mak` will be 0 (since `i` is 0 initially).
  - `i` will be 1 after increment.
  - Output: `?, 0, 0, 1, 1`

- If the input is not `'<'`:
  - `mak` will remain 0.
  - `i` will be 1 after increment.
  - Output: `?, 0, 0, 1, 1`

Since the exact input is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **?, mak, mak, i, i (where mak is set to i if the current input is '<', otherwise mak is 0, and i is the current iteration number starting from 1)**

Given the first iteration, the most precise output for the first iteration is:

Output: **?, 0, 0, 1, 1** (assuming the initial input is not `'<'`)

However, to adhere strictly to the format and provide a general answer:

Output: **?, mak, mak, i, i (where mak is set to i if the current input is '<', otherwise mak is 0, and i is the current iteration number)**
