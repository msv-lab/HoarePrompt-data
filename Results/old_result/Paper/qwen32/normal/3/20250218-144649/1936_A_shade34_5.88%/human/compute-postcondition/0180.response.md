Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `s` is the input string. If `s` equals '<', `pans` is a list containing `[i]` and `mak` is the value of `i`. If `s` equals '=', `pans` is a list containing the element `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
