Output State: **t (number of test cases) is at least 1; n is unchanged; mak2 is 0; pans is a list of all indices i for which the input was '='; mak is the index of the last element in pans for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such element exists.**

In simple terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `mak` will hold the index of the last element in the `pans` list for which the input was '>'. If there was no input of '>', `mak` will remain 0. All other variables like `t`, `n`, and `mak2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
