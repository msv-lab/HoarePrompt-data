The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `i` are affected by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call. The variable `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1, but this increment is not part of the provided code snippet and should be considered as a separate operation.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception of the increment of `i` which is not shown in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1.**
