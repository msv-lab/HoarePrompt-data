To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself. However, the initial state does not specify the values or definitions of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:

- `mak`: This variable is mentioned but its value or definition is not provided in the initial state. We can only refer to it as `mak`.
- `mak2`: This variable is mentioned twice in the print statement and its value or definition is also not provided in the initial state. We can only refer to it as `mak2`.
- `i`: This variable is mentioned once in the print statement and its value or definition is not provided in the initial state. We can only refer to it as `i`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the values of these variables in the specified order.

Output: **? mak mak2 i mak2 (where mak, mak2, and i are the values of the respective variables)**
