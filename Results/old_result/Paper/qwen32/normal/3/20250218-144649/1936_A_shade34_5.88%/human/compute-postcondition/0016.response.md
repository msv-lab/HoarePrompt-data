The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
