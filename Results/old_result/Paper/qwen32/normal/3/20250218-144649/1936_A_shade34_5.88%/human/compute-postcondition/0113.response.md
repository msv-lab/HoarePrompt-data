The code snippet `pans = [i]` directly assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`, regardless of the initial value of `pans`. Given that `i` is 1, `pans` will now be `[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is `[1]`, `mak` is 1.**
