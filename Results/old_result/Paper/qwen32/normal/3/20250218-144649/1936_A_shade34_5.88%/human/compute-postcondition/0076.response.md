The code snippet provided sets the variable `mak` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, or `pans`. Therefore, the only change is the value of `mak`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`; `mak` is 0.**
