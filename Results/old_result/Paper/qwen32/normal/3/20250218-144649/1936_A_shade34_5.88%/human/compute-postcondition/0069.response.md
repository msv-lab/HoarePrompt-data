The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to the incremented value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `mak` is equal to the incremented value of `i`.**
