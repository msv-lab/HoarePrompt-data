The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented in the initial state, but its new value is not recalculated here; it is simply appended to `pans`.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `pans` contains the new value of `i`.**
