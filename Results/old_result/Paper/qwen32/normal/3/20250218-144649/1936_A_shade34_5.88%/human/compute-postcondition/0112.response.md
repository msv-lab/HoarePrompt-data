The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is 1, `mak` will now also be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string. If the new `s` is equal to '<', `pans` is `[None]`. If the new `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list containing one element `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list. `mak` is 1.**
