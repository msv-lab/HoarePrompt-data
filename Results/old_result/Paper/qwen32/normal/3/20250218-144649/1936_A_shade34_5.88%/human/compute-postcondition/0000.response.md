In the given task, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable, and `int(input())` which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The number of iterations is based on the input value `t` (the number of test cases).

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that the input value `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not used within the loop.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1**
