The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`. Therefore, we can only state that `mak` will take the value of `i` after the execution of the code. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the input string and its current value is `<`; `mak` is equal to `i`.**
