To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is at least 0.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop.
   - `mak` is set to `i` if the current input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
   - `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `mak` is set to `i` only when the input is `'>'`. Otherwise, it remains 0.
   - `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, which means it could be 0 or some index `i` where the input was `'>'`.
   - `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `'='`. Since it must have at least 2 elements, we know `pans` is not empty and has at least two indices.
   - `i` is the current index in the loop, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Determining the printed values:**
   - `pans[mak]`: This will be the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list. If `mak` is 0 (which it would be if there were no `'>'` inputs), then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - `pans[i]`: This will be the element at index `i` in the `pans` list. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `pans[i]` will be the element at the current index `i` in the `pans` list.

Given that `mak` could be 0 or some index `i` where the input was `'>'`, and `i` is the current index in the loop, we can't determine the exact numerical values without knowing the specific inputs. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information:

- If `mak` is 0 (which is the default if there are no `'>'` inputs), `pans[mak]` will be `pans[0]`.
- `pans[i]` will be the element at the current index `i` in the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is the final value of mak before the loop, pans is the list of indices where the input was '=', and i is the current index in the loop)**
