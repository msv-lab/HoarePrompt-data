The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 2, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `s` is the new input string, `i` is 2. If `s` equals '<', then `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` equals '=', then `pans` has been updated to include the value 1.**
