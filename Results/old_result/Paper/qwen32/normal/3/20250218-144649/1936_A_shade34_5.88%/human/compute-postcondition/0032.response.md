The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. The previous values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `pans` will have `i` as its new last element.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the input string, and `s` is equal to '='; `pans` has `i` appended to it.**
