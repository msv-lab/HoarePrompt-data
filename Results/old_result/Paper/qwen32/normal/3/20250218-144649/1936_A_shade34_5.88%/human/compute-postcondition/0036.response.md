To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is the input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. **`mak`**: The value of `mak` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value.
3. **`mak2`**: Similarly, the value of `mak2` is not provided in the initial state. Thus, we cannot determine its exact value.
4. **`i`**: The initial state mentions that `i` is `i + 1`. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided. Therefore, we only know that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its initial value.
5. **`mak2`**: This is repeated in the print statement. Like the first occurrence, we cannot determine its exact value.

### Output:
Since `mak` and `mak2` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe their values in terms of the variables themselves.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are the values of variables mak and mak2 respectively, and [i] is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
