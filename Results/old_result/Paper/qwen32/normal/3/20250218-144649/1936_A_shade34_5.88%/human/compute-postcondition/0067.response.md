Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1.
- `n` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it's irrelevant to this print statement).
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

**Analysis:**
- `mak` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely a typo and should be `mak2` based on the provided information.
- `mak2` is explicitly set to 0.
- `pans` is a list of indices where the input was '=', and it has at least 2 elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 0, it would now be 1.

So, the print statement becomes:
```python
print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[1], pans[1])
```

**Output:**
The code will print a question mark followed by the first element of `pans` twice, and then the second element of `pans` twice.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where pans[0] is the first index where the input was '=' and pans[1] is the second index where the input was '=')**
