The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last processed index + 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The variable `n` remains the same as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

So, if `i` is the last processed index + 1, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` (which is the next index to be processed). The value of `n` should remain greater than 1 as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `i` is the last processed index + 2**
