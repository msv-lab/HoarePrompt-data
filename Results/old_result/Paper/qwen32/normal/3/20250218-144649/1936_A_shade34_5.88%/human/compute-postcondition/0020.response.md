To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions that control its execution.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it prints a query and checks the input. If the input is `'<'`, it updates `mak` to the current value of `i`. After all iterations, `mak` will hold the largest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`.

### Final Output State Analysis

- **`t`**: The number of test cases remains unchanged and is at least 1.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged and determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
- **`mak`**: This variable will hold the largest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If no input was `'<'`, `mak` will remain 0.

### Natural Language Explanation

After the loop has completed all its iterations, `mak` will be the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input was `'<'`. If no such input was received, `mak` will remain 0. The number of test cases `t` and the value of `n` will remain the same as they were at the start.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.**
