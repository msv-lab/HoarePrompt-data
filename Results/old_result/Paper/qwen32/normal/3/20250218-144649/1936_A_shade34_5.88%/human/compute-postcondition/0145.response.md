To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables `mak2` and `mak` are defined.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is at least 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`.
- `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`.
- `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the comparison resulted in `'>'`.

### Analysis:
1. **`pans` List Construction:**
   - `pans` includes indices where the input string `s` was `=` or the last index where `s` was `<`.
   - For example, if `s` is `'<<=>='`, `pans` might look like `[1, 3, 4]` (assuming indices start from 0).

2. **`mak` Calculation:**
   - `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the comparison resulted in `'>'`.
   - To determine `mak`, we need to know the indices in `pans` and the comparisons that led to `>` at those indices.
   - For example, if `s` is `'<<=>='` and the comparisons at those indices were `'<', '<', '>', '=', '='`, then `mak` would be `3` (since the comparison at index `3` was `'>'` and it is the largest index in `pans` with a `'>'` comparison).

3. **`mak2` Assignment:**
   - `mak2` is simply the final value of `mak`.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement `print('!', mak2, mak)` will output the string `'!'`, followed by the values of `mak2` and `mak`.
- Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the output will be `'!'` followed by the value of `mak` twice.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the definitions, the output will be:
Output: **! [mak] [mak] (where [mak] is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the comparison resulted in '>')**
