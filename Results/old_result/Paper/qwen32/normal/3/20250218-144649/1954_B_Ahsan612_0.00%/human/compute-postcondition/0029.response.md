The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` will update the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.

Given the initial state:
- `minn` is 1
- `same` is 3 if `i` is 5 else `same` is 1
- `i` is 5 if `same` is 3 else `i` is 6

We need to consider the two possible cases for `same` and `i`:

**Case 1: `same` is 3**
- This implies `i` is 5 (since `i` is 5 if `same` is 3).
- In this case, `minn` will be updated to `min(1, 3)`, which is 1.

**Case 2: `same` is 1**
- This implies `i` is 6 (since `i` is 6 if `same` is 1).
- In this case, `minn` will be updated to `min(1, 1)`, which is 1.

In both cases, the value of `minn` remains 1. Therefore, the value of `minn` does not change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 5 if `same` is 3 else `i` is 6, `same` is 3 if `i` is 5 else `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[5]` if `same` is 3 else `num` is `ar[6]`.**
