The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with the value of `same` and updates `minn` to be the smaller of the two. Given the initial state, `minn` is 1 and `same` is 1. Therefore, the minimum of `minn` and `same` is 1, and `minn` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[4]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 4**.
