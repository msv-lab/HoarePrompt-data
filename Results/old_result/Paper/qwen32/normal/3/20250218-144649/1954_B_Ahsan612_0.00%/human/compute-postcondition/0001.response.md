The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer**.
