The code snippet assigns the value of the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, where `minn` is `inf` if no valid minimum has been found yet; `i` is `len(ar)`**.
