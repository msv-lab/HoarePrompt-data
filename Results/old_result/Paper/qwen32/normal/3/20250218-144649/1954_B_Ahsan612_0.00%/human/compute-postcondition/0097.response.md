To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < len(ar)`. The variables `i` and `len(ar)` are the ones that directly influence whether the loop can continue executing.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `n` is the new input integer (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements (this variable is part of the loop condition, specifically `len(ar)`).
- `i` is `i + 1` (this variable is part of the loop condition).
- `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]` (these variables are not part of the loop condition, so they don't need to be adjusted).
- `minn` remains `inf` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `minn` is updated to 1 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(ar)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented, so to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `len(ar)`.

To guarantee this, we need to make sure that `len(ar)` is greater than the current value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, if `i` is currently `len(ar) - 1`, the loop will still execute one more time because `i` will be incremented to `len(ar)`, but the loop condition is checked before the increment.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 1` elements; `i` is `i + 1`; `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`; `minn` remains `inf` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `minn` is updated to 1**.
