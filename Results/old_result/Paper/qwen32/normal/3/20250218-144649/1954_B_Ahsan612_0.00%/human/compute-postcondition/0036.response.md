The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1` directly. The value to be printed is not dependent on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, or `i` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement is a simple output of the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(-1)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
