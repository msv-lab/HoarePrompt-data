The code snippet sets the variable `same` to `1`. This change impacts the variable `same`, but it does not affect the values of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, or `minn`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `same` while keeping other variables as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 1` elements; `i` is `i + 2`; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[i]`; `minn` is `1` if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` or `same` was `1`, otherwise `minn` is `2`.**
