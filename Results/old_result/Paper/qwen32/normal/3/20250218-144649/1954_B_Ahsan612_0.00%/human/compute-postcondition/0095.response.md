Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is 1 if `ar[i]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `i` is 2. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `minn` remains `inf`; otherwise, `minn` is updated to 1.**
