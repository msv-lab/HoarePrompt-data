Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
