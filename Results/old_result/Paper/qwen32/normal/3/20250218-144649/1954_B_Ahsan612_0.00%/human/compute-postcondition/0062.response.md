The code snippet provided is `same = 1`, which reassigns the variable `same` to the value `1`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the variable `same`, which is explicitly set to `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[4]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 4**.
