Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`; `num` is the last unique number encountered in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`; `i` is `len(ar)`.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same`. All other variables remain unchanged.
