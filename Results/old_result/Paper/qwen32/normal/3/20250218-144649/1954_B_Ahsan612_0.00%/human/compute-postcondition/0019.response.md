The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 3, so now `i` is 4. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1**.
