The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` compares the current value of `minn` with `same` and assigns the smaller of the two to `minn`. Given the initial state:

- `minn` is initially 1.
- `same` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `ar[i] == num`.

Since `minn` is initially 1, and `same` can only be 1 or 2, the minimum value between `minn` and `same` will always be 1. Therefore, `minn` will remain 1 after the execution of the code.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `minn` is 1; `i` is 5 if `ar[i] == num` and 6 otherwise; `same` is 2 if `ar[i] == num` and 1 otherwise; `num` is `ar[i]`.**
