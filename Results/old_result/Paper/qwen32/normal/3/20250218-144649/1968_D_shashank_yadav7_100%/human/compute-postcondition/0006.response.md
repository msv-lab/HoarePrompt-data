Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers read from the input, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `s` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
