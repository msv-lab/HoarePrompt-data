The given code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which means it will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, it does not change any of the variables' values.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the same values for all the variables as they were in the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `k` remains 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `bm` remains the same, `sm` is `max(a[p[s] - 1] * (k - 1), a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `sm` remains the same.**
