Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is either 0 or the second integer read from the input minus `n`, `b` is the result of applying `p[b] - 1` iteratively `n` times or until `k` reaches 0, `s` is the result of applying `p[s] - 1` iteratively `n` times or until `k` reaches 0, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` values from each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` values from each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` encountered, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` encountered, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran, and `bm` is greater than `sm`.**
