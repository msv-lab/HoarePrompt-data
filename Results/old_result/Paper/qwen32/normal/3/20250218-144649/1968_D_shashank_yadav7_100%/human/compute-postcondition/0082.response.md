The code snippet `bp += a[b]` modifies the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` (or if `k == 0` we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), `b` is `p[p[previous b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 1. If `k == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
