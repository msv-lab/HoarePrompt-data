### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the permutation and calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. However, the logic and implementation of the program are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program initializes `bm` and `sm` as `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which is incorrect. The score should be initialized as `a[b]` and `a[s]` because the players start by adding the value at their starting positions.
   - The calculation inside the loop is also incorrect. The program updates `bm` and `sm` by adding `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` respectively, which does not reflect the actual rules of the game. The correct approach would be to update the scores by adding the value at the current position and then consider the maximum score possible after each move.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, but it should run `k` times because the game lasts for `k` turns.
   - The decrement of `k` inside the loop is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, the loop should run exactly `k` times.

3. **Updating Scores:**
   - The scores should be updated by adding the value at the current position in each turn, and the maximum score should be tracked correctly.

### Correct Implementation:

Below is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

### Correctness:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected version above should be used to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
