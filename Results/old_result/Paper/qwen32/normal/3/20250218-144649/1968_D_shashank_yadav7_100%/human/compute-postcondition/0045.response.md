Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n, initial_k)`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop terminated early, otherwise `n - i`, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for all iterations, and `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
