Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Game Overview**: Players Bodya and Sasha start at positions `P_B` and `P_S` in a permutation `p`.
- **Turns**: The game lasts `k` turns. Each turn, each player:
  - Adds the value at their current position in array `a` to their score.
  - Moves either to their current position or to `p_x` (the value at their current position in the permutation).
- **Objective**: Determine the winner after `k` turns based on the scores.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - Adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - Initializes `bp` and `sp` to the values at `P_B` and `P_S` in `a`, respectively.
   - Initializes `bm` and `sm` to the maximum possible scores if they stay in their positions for all `k` turns.

4. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The loop runs up to `n` times, but it breaks when `k` turns are completed.
   - In each iteration:
     - Decrements `k` by 1.
     - Updates `b` and `s` to their next positions in the permutation.
     - Updates `bm` and `sm` to the maximum possible scores considering the current turn and previous scores.
     - Adds the current position's value in `a` to `bp` and `sp`.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - After the loop, compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
  - The program incorrectly calculates `bm` and `sm` by multiplying `a[b]` and `a[s]` by `k` and adding `bp` and `sp`, respectively. This doesn't reflect the correct strategy of maximizing scores by either staying or moving.
  
- **Loop Limitation**:
  - The loop is limited to `n` iterations, which is not necessary. The game can run up to `k` turns, and the loop should ensure that it runs exactly `k` times unless a cycle is detected.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on optimal strategies.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
