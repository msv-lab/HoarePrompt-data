Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each testcase consists of four integers n, k, P_B, P_S where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The next line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n) representing the permutation p. The following line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of all n across all testcases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n, initial_k)`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop terminated early, otherwise `n - i`, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for all iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations minus 1, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations or the point where `k` becomes 0. Additionally, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`; otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is either 0 or the second integer read from the input minus `n`, `b` is the result of applying `p[b] - 1` iteratively `n` times or until `k` reaches 0, `s` is the result of applying `p[s] - 1` iteratively `n` times or until `k` reaches 0, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` values from each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` values from each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` encountered, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` encountered, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`; otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
