The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `p`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers read from the input, `p` is a list of integers read from the input.**
