The code snippet `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to be `p[s] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `s` was initially `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`. After executing the code, the new value of `s` becomes `p[s] - 1`, where `s` is the value it had before the update. 

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 2.**
