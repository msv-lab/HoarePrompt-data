Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is the second integer read from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input minus 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0`**
