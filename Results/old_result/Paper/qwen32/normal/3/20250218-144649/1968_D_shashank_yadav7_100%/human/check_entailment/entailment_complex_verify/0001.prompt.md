You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, a permutation `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and compares the maximum possible values of two expressions involving elements from `a` and the permutation `p`, adjusted by `k`. It then prints "Bodya" if one expression is greater, "Sasha" if the other is greater, or "Draw" if they are equal.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Game Overview**: Players Bodya and Sasha start at positions `P_B` and `P_S` in a permutation `p`.
- **Turns**: The game lasts `k` turns. Each turn, each player:
  - Adds the value at their current position in array `a` to their score.
  - Moves either to their current position or to `p_x` (the value at their current position in the permutation).
- **Objective**: Determine the winner after `k` turns based on the scores.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - Adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - Initializes `bp` and `sp` to the values at `P_B` and `P_S` in `a`, respectively.
   - Initializes `bm` and `sm` to the maximum possible scores if they stay in their positions for all `k` turns.

4. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The loop runs up to `n` times, but it breaks when `k` turns are completed.
   - In each iteration:
     - Decrements `k` by 1.
     - Updates `b` and `s` to their next positions in the permutation.
     - Updates `bm` and `sm` to the maximum possible scores considering the current turn and previous scores.
     - Adds the current position's value in `a` to `bp` and `sp`.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - After the loop, compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
  - The program incorrectly calculates `bm` and `sm` by multiplying `a[b]` and `a[s]` by `k` and adding `bp` and `sp`, respectively. This doesn't reflect the correct strategy of maximizing scores by either staying or moving.
  
- **Loop Limitation**:
  - The loop is limited to `n` iterations, which is not necessary. The game can run up to `k` turns, and the loop should ensure that it runs exactly `k` times unless a cycle is detected.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on optimal strategies.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
