The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables in the given initial state. It merely exits the most internal loop or if statement it is nested within. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is the second integer read from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input minus 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
