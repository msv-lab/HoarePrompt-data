The code assigns the value of `a[b] * k` to the variable `bm`. The values of `a[b]` and `k` are used to compute this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers read from the input, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`**.
