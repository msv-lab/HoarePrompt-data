The code snippet reads two values from the input and splits them into `list_len` and `max_power`. This means that `list_len` and `max_power` will now hold the first and second values from the input, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `operational_list`, `rev_res`, and `rev_val`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list.**
