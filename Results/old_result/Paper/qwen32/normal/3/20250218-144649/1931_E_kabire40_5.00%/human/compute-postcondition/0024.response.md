The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the range `len(rev_val)`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `rev_val` has at least one element, so `len(rev_val)` is greater than 0. The variable `x` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `rev_val` is not empty.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is the concatenated string of all substrings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original substring, `rev_val` is a list of all reversed substrings from `operational_list` that do not meet the length criteria, and `rev_val` is sorted, `rev_val` must have at least one element**
