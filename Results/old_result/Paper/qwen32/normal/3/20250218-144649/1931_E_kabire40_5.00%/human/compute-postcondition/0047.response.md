The provided initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any of the variables described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Sasha**
