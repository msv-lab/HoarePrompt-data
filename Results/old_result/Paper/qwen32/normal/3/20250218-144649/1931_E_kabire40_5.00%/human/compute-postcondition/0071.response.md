The code snippet `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of `x` to the `rev_val` list. Given the initial state, `rev_val` already contains the third element of `operational_list` and the reverse of `x` if the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`. After executing the code, `rev_val` will have an additional element, which is the reverse of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 3 substrings, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is the string representation of `x_rev` if the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, otherwise `rev_res` is an empty string, and `rev_val` is a list containing the third element of `operational_list` and the reverse of `x` (if the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`), and the reverse of `x` is appended to `rev_val`.**
