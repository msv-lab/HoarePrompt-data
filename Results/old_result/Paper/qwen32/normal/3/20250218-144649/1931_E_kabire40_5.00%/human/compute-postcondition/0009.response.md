Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`**
