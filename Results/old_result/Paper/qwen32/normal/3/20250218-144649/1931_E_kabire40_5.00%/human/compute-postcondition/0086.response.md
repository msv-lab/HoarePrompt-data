Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x`, plus either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x` and must have at least one element, `x` is `x + 1`, `val_in` is the value at index `x` of `rev_val`.**

Natural language: The value of `val_in` is now the value at index `x` of `rev_val`. All other variables remain unchanged.
