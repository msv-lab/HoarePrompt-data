In the provided loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, and `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the given integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted since it is not used within the loop body and is just a placeholder for the loop variable.

Given that the state before the loop starts already specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, no adjustment is actually needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, we should clearly state the condition for `t` to ensure the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
