Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, where either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis
The `print` statement in the code snippet will output the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the string `'Yes'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any variables.

### Output
Output: **Yes**
