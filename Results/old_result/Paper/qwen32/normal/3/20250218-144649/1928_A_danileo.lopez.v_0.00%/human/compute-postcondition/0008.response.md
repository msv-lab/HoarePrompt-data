The only variable in the loop head is `_` (a throwaway variable) and `t`, which is the number of iterations. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, then either `a` or `b` is even. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` are odd integers.**
