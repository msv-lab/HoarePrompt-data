### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key insight is that if either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, the rectangle can be cut in a way that allows the formation of a different rectangle. This is because cutting an even side results in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different configuration.

Specifically:
- If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two `a/2 x b` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `b x a/2` rectangle (which is different if `a != 2b`).
- If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two `a x b/2` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `b/2 x a` rectangle (which is different if `b != 2a`).
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into smaller rectangles of size `1 x a` or `b x 1`, which can only be rearranged into the same `a x b` rectangle.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". This aligns with the problem requirements.
