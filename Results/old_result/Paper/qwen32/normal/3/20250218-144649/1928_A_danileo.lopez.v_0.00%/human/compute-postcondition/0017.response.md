Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, where either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers. The condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` is evaluated, but the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
