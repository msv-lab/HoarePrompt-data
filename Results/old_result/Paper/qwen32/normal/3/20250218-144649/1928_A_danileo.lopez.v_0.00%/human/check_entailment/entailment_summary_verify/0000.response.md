Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form a different rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90Â° rotation of the other.

### Key Observations
1. **Even Dimension Case**: If either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles such that they can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example:
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a `a x b/2` or `b x a/2` rectangle.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form an `a/2 x b` or `b x a/2` rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimension Case**: If both dimensions (`a` and `b`) are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions. This is because cutting an odd-sized side in half would result in non-integer dimensions.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "Yes" if either `a` or `b` is even, and "No" if both `a` and `b` are odd. This aligns perfectly with the observations made above.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program: it checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if so, otherwise it prints "No".

### Original Assessment
The original assessment is correct. The program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by checking if at least one of the dimensions is even. It correctly handles all edge cases, including when `a` or `b` is 1.

### Conclusion
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.

Final: **True**
