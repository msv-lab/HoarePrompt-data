### Reasoning:

The problem states that Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. The goal is to determine if he can form a new rectangle different from the original one using the two resulting smaller rectangles.

To form a new rectangle:
- If the original rectangle has dimensions \(a \times b\), a valid cut parallel to one of the sides will result in two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) (if \(b\) is even), or \(a \times (b-1)\) and \(a \times 1\) (if \(b\) is odd).
- Similarly, if the cut is made parallel to the other side, we get two rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) (if \(a\) is even), or \((a-1) \times b\) and \(1 \times b\) (if \(a\) is odd).

From these smaller rectangles, Bob can try to form a new rectangle:
- If \(a\) is even, he can form a rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\).
- If \(b\) is even, he can form a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, he can only form rectangles of dimensions \(a \times b\), \(1 \times ab\), or similar, which are essentially the same as the original rectangle or invalid (not a rectangle).

Thus, the key observation is that Bob can form a new rectangle different from the original if and only if at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even. This is because if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only rectangles he can form are essentially the same as the original rectangle or invalid.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and printing "Yes" if so, otherwise printing "No".
