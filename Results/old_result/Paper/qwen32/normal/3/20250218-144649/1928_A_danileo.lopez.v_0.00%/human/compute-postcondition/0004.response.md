Given the initial state, we have the following variables:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, with the condition that either `a` or `b` (or both) is even.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

The `print` statement will output the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`. The condition about `a` and `b` being even does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
