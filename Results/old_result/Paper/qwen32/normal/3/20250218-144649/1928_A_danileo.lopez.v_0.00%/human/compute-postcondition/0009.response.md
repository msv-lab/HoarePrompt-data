The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state specifies conditions on `a` and `b` regarding their parity (even or odd), but since `a` and `b` are being reassigned from the input, these conditions will be based on the new values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, then either `a` or `b` is even. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` are odd integers.**
In simpler terms, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided in the input, maintaining the precondition regarding their parity.
