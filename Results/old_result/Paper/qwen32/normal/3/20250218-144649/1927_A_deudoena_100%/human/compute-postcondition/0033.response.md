The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the characters in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` after the previous `j`. Since `j` was the last character processed, it needs to be updated to the character before it in the reversed string.

Given that `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be updated to the previous character in the reversed string.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present, `mi` is `k` if the first 'B' is at position `k`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is `k`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` (which is the character before the previous `j` in the reversed string)**

To be more specific, if `j` was the `i`-th character from the end in the previous iteration, it should now be the `(i+1)`-th character from the end in the current iteration. However, since we don't have the exact position of `j` in the string, we can describe it as the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present, `mi` is `k` if the first 'B' is at position `k`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is `k`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`**
