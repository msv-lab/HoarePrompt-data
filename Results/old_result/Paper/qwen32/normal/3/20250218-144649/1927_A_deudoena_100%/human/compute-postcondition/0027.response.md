Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is `n - 1` if `j` is 'B', otherwise it remains 0; `mi` is k if the first 'B' is at position k; `m` is an input integer; `c` is k; `d` is 1; `l` is an empty list; if `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
