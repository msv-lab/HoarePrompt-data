The given code snippet initializes an empty list `l`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, `d`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list.**
