Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white. The logic in the `func_1` function does not account for the correct minimum segment length that covers all black cells.

Let's analyze the code:
1. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum length of a segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.
2. The code finds the first occurrence of a black cell (`mi`) and the last occurrence of a black cell (`ma`).
3. It then returns `ma - mi + 2` as the minimum segment length.

However, this logic is incorrect because the segment should cover all black cells, not just the first and last occurrence. The correct approach would be to find the segment that spans from the first black cell to the last black cell, which is `ma - mi + 1`.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- Input: `n = 1`, `s = "B"`
  - The current code will return `ma - mi + 2 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because the entire segment of length 1 needs to be painted.

- Input: `n = 3`, `s = "BBW"`
  - The current code will return `ma - mi + 2 = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because the segment from the 1st to the 2nd cell needs to be painted.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
