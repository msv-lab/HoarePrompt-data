Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); the input consists of `t` test cases where each test case has an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If the integer 1 is in the list `l`, then the list `l` includes the integer 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; If the integer 1 is in the new list `l`, then the list `l` includes the integer 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`; `i` is 4. The presence or absence of the integer 1 in the list `l` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `e`, `m`, or `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 5; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; if the integer 1 is in the new list `l`, then the list `l` includes the integer 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`; `i` is 5. The presence or absence of the integer 1 in the list `l` determines the execution path, but the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, `m`, and `i` remain consistent with their initial descriptions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
