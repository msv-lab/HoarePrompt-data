The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `i` and the control variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state of `i` before the loop starts does not affect whether the loop will execute, as `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function in the loop head.

Given that the loop iterates over the number of test cases (`t`), we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once. The problem statement specifies that `t` is an integer in the range from 1 to 10,000, so any value within this range will ensure that the loop executes.

Since `i` is controlled by the loop and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration, we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is simply that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1**
