The code snippet provided is a single line that reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `t`, which now holds the value input by the user. All other information about the test cases and piles remains unchanged as the code has not yet processed any of that data.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); the input consists of `t` test cases where each test case has an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
