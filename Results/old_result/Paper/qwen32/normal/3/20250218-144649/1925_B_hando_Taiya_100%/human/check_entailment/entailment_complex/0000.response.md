### Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the maximum balance of a problemset, where the balance is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems, and the sum of the difficulties equals \( x \). The number of sub-problems is \( n \).

The solution involves iterating through the divisors of \( x \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \). For each divisor \( i \), it checks if \( n \leq i \) or \( n \leq \frac{x}{i} \). If either condition is true, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and either \( i \) or \( \frac{x}{i} \).

This approach is based on the fact that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of \( x \). By iterating through the divisors up to \( \sqrt{x} \), the program efficiently finds the maximum possible GCD that satisfies the condition \( n \leq \text{difficulty} \).

Let's verify the logic with the given examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - \( x = 10 \), \( n = 3 \)
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking conditions:
     - For \( i = 1 \): \( n \leq 1 \) is false
     - For \( i = 2 \): \( n \leq 2 \) is false, but \( n \leq 10 / 2 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 2 \)
     - For \( i = 5 \): \( n \leq 5 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 5 \)
     - For \( i = 10 \): \( n \leq 10 \) is true, but \( \text{ans} \) is already 5
   - Maximum balance: 2 (achievable with difficulties [4, 2, 4])

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - \( x = 5 \), \( n = 5 \)
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - Checking conditions:
     - For \( i = 1 \): \( n \leq 1 \) is false, but \( n \leq 5 / 1 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 1 \)
     - For \( i = 5 \): \( n \leq 5 \) is true, but \( \text{ans} \) is already 1
   - Maximum balance: 1 (achievable with difficulties [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - \( x = 420 \), \( n = 69 \)
   - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - Checking conditions:
     - For \( i = 6 \): \( n \leq 6 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 6 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 6 \)
     - For \( i = 7 \): \( n \leq 7 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 7 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 7 \)
     - For \( i = 10 \): \( n \leq 10 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 10 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 10 \)
     - For \( i = 12 \): \( n \leq 12 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 12 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 12 \)
     - For \( i = 14 \): \( n \leq 14 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 14 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 14 \)
     - For \( i = 15 \): \( n \leq 15 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 15 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 15 \)
     - For \( i = 20 \): \( n \leq 20 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 20 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 20 \)
     - For \( i = 21 \): \( n \leq 21 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 21 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 21 \)
     - For \( i = 28 \): \( n \leq 28 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 28 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 28 \)
     - For \( i = 30 \): \( n \leq 30 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 30 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 30 \)
     - For \( i = 35 \): \( n \leq 35 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 35 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 35 \)
     - For \( i = 42 \): \( n \leq 42 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 42 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 42 \)
     - For \( i = 60 \): \( n \leq 60 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 60 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 60 \)
     - For \( i = 70 \): \( n \leq 70 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 70 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 70 \)
     - For \( i = 84 \): \( n \leq 84 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 84 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 84 \)
     - For \( i = 105 \): \( n \leq 105 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 105 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 105 \)
     - For \( i = 140 \): \( n \leq 140 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 140 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 140 \)
     - For \( i = 210 \): \( n \leq 210 \) is false, but \( n \leq 420 / 210 \) is true, so \( \text{ans} = 210 \)
     - For \( i = 420 \): \( n \leq 420 \) is true, but \( \text{ans} \) is already 60
   - Maximum balance: 6 (achievable with difficulties [70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70])

The program correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case.
