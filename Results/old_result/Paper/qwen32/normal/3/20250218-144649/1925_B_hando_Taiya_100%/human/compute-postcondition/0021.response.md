Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
