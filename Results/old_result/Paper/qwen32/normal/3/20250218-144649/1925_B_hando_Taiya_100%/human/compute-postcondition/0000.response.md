Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the given code snippet.
