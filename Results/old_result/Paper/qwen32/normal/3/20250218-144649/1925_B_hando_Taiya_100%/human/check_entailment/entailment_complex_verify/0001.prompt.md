You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers x and n such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` such that `n <= i` or `n <= x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the maximum value of either i or x // i such that n <= i or n <= x // i for all divisors i of x up to isqrt(x))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value of either `i` or `x // i` such that `n` is less than or equal to `i` or `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`. The goal is to maximize the balance, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

### Key Observations

1. **Divisors of `x`:** The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties will be a divisor of `x`. This is because the GCD of any set of numbers divides each number in the set, and thus it must divide `x`.

2. **Feasibility of Divisors:** For a divisor `d` of `x`, it must be possible to partition `x` into `n` parts where each part is a positive integer and their sum is `x`. This is feasible if and only if `x / d` (the number of parts each of difficulty `d`) is at least `n`.

3. **Maximizing GCD:** To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x / d >= n`.

### Program Analysis

The program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be a feasible GCD by verifying if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`, respectively.

#### Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Finding Divisors:** It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x`.
3. **Checking Feasibility:** For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be a feasible GCD by ensuring `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`.
4. **Updating Maximum GCD:** It keeps track of the maximum feasible GCD found.

### Correctness of the Program

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD by iterating through the divisors of `x` and checking the feasibility condition. The use of the square root to limit the divisor search is an optimization that ensures the program runs efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and the problem requirements, it is clear that the program correctly finds the maximum balance (GCD) for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
