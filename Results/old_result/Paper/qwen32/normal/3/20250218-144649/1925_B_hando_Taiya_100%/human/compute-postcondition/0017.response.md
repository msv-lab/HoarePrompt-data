The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `isqrt(x) + 1`. According to the loop statement, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented, so for the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer value. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x)`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the next integer value (i.e., `i` from the previous state plus 1); `ans` remains unchanged.**
