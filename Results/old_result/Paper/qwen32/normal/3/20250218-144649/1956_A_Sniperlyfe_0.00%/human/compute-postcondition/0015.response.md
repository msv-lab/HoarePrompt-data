To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand that the loop iterates over each element in the list `qs`. For each element `n` in `qs`, it computes `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to the list `res`. The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in `qs`.

Given the pattern in the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that after all iterations, the list `res` will contain as many elements as there are in `qs`, with each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the last element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are in `qs`, with each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has processed all elements in `qs`, `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1` to each element of `qs` in sequence, and all other variables (`n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `qs`) will remain as they were defined initially, except `n` which will hold the last value from `qs` as per the loop's execution.
