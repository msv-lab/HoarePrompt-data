The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how the loop progresses.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the current element from `qs`.
- `qs` is a list that must have at least two elements.
- The loop iterates over each element in `qs`.

Since `n` is the current element from `qs` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `n` will be the next element in `qs`.

Let's assume that `qs` has at least two elements. If `n` was the first element in `qs` during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `n` will be the second element in `qs`.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the next element in `qs` (which is the second element if the previous `n` was the first), `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `t` is at least 1**.

To be more precise, if `n` was the first element in `qs` during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `n` will be `qs[1]`.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `qs[1]`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `t` is at least 1**.
