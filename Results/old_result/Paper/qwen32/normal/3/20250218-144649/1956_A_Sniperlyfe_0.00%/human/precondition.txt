n is a list of integers representing the number of players in each test case, and p is a tuple containing two lists: the first list is a sorted list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round (with 1-based indexing), and the second list is a list of integers representing the number of players for which the number of winners needs to be determined. The lengths of the lists in p are constrained by 1 <= len(p[0]) <= 100 and 1 <= len(p[1]) <= 100. Each element in p[0] is a unique integer within the range 1 to 100, and each element in p[1] is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
