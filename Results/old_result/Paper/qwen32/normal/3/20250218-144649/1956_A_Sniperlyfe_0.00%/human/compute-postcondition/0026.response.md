To determine the output, we need to understand the values and transformations of the variables involved in the `print` statement.

### Given Initial State:
- `k` is the first integer from the input.
- `q` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is the next element in `qs` after the current `n`.
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the newly appended result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Analysis:
- `res` is a list that contains two elements, both of which are the result of calling the function `func_1(n, p)`. This means that `res` is of the form `[result_of_func_1, result_of_func_1]`.
- The `print` statement uses `map(str, res)` to convert each element of `res` to a string and then joins them with a space `' '`.

### Output Description:
- Since `res` contains two identical elements (both results of `func_1(n, p)`), the output will be the string representation of `result_of_func_1` repeated twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Given that we do not have the specific values of `n` and `p` or the definition of `func_1`, we can only describe the output in terms of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **result_of_func_1 result_of_func_1 (where result_of_func_1 is the result of the function func_1(n, p))**
