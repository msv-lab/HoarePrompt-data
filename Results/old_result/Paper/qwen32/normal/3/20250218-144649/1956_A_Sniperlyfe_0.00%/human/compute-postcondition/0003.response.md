The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `q` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer.**
