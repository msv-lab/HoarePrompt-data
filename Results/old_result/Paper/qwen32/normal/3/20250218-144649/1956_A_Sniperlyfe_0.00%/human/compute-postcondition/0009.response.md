The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `n` to the next value in the list `qs`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players.
- `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
- `k` is the first input integer.
- `q` is the second input integer.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element.
- `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` would have taken the value of the current element in `qs` that was just processed. For the next iteration, `n` should take the value of the next element in `qs`.

Let's denote the current index of `n` in `qs` as `current_index`. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `current_index` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `n` should be set to `qs[current_index + 1]`.

However, since we don't have the value of `current_index` explicitly, we can only express the state in terms of the next value in `qs` after `n`.

State: **`n` is the next element in `qs` after the current `n`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

To be more specific, if we assume that `n` was the `i`-th element of `qs` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `n` will be the `(i+1)`-th element of `qs`.

State: **`n` is `qs[i+1]` where `i` is the index of the current `n` in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Since we don't have the exact index `i`, we can simply state that `n` takes the next value from `qs`.

State: **`n` is the next element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
