To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand the variables and their relationships.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `k` and `q` are the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements.
- `n` is the second element of the list `qs` (i.e., `qs[1]`).
- `p` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times.
- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the given `print` statement, it is part of the initial state).

### Key Points:
- The `print` statement uses `map(str, res)` to convert each element of the `res` list to a string and then joins them with spaces.
- `res` is a list with three identical elements, each being the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.

### Output Determination:
- Since `res` contains three identical elements, the `print` statement will output three identical strings, each representing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **[result_of_func_1(n, p)] [result_of_func_1(n, p)] [result_of_func_1(n, p)] (where result_of_func_1(n, p) is the result of the function func_1 with n=qs[1] and p as the list of integers read from the input)**

This output describes the exact content that will be printed, using the provided initial state information.
