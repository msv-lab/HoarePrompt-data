You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, and p is a list of k integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= k <= 100 with 1 <= p[i] <= 100 for all i in the range of k.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the last `qs` processed, `k` and `q` are the last values read from the input, `p` is the last list of positions read from the input, `qs` is the last list of integers read from the input, `n` is the last element in the last `qs`, and `t` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, and `p`, a list of `k` integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round. The function returns the position of the last remaining player after all specified rounds of kicking out players.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
