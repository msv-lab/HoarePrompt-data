The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, `tc`, and `ppp` as described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `N` is an integer read from the input.
   - `i` is initialized to `N`.
   - `num` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The current value of `s` is 1.
   - There is a conditional statement that changes variables if `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is equal to 23, but this condition does not affect the print statement.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(-1, -1)` statement is executed regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.
   - The print statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values, the output will always be `-1, -1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
