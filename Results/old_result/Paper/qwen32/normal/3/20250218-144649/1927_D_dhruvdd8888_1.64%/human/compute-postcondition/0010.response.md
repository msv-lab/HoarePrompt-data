Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0; `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`; `arr` contains a new element `(1 + s, i, num)`**

Explanation: The variable `arr` has been updated to include a new element, which is a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)`. The values of `t`, `N`, `i`, and `nums[i]` remain unchanged.
