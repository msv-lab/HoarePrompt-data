### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Requirements:
For each query, we need to find two different indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we should output `-1 -1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - It creates a list `arr` that contains segments of the array where each segment consists of consecutive equal elements. Each element in `arr` is a tuple `(start, end, value)` representing the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
   - The array is extended by appending `-1` to handle edge cases more easily.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that starts at or after the query's start index `l`.
   - It then checks the start and end indices of the found segment to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` can be found within the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `i` and `j` if a valid pair is found.
   - If no valid pair is found, it prints `-1 -1`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Query Handling:** The program does not correctly handle all cases of queries. Specifically, the logic for finding a valid pair `(i, j)` is flawed. The current implementation does not consider all possible segments within the range `[l, r]` and incorrectly assumes that the first segment found will always provide a valid pair.
- **Edge Cases:** The logic for handling edge cases (e.g., when `s == 1` or `e >= r`) is incomplete and may not cover all scenarios.
- **Debugging Statements:** There are debugging statements (`if ppp == 23:`) that should be removed in the final version of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios for finding a valid pair `(i, j)` for each query. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct based on the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
