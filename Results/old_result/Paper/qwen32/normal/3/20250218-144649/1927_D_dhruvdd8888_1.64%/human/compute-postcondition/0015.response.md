The code appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple consists of three elements: `(1 + s, i, num)`. The variables `t`, `N`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged except for the modification to `arr`.

Given that `i` is 1, `num` is `nums[i]`, and `s` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is assumed to be known in the context of the code, the tuple `(1 + s, 1, nums[i])` is added to `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `num` is `nums[i]`, `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 1, nums[i])` appended to it.**
