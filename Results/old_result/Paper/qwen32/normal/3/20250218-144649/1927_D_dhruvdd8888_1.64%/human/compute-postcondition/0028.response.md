Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
