Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are new integers read from the input as a tuple; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`; `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `tc > 5`, the input value for the loop is decremented by 1 to ensure one more iteration. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables. The condition `s > l` does not affect the variables as the postcondition remains unchanged in both the if and else parts. If `e >= r`, the if part executes; otherwise, the else part executes. In both cases, the variables retain their described values and properties.**
