To determine the output of the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `N`: An integer read from the input.
   - `i`: Initially set to `N`.
   - `num`: Initialized to `-1`.
   - `arr`: A list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. The exact contents of `arr` are not provided.
   - `LA`: Defined as `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r`: Integers read from the input as a tuple.
   - `eli`: The index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - `s` and `e`: The first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

2. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The value of `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The value of `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The print statement outputs `s` and `e + 1`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since the exact contents of `arr` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical values of `s` and `e`.
   - However, we know that `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Given the information, the output will be the first and second elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, with the second element incremented by 1.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s and e are the first and second elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
