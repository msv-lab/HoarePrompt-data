The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `s`. Given that `i` is 1, `s` will now hold the value 1. The values of `t`, `N`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `num` is `nums[i]`, `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 1, nums[i])` appended to it, `s` is 1.**
