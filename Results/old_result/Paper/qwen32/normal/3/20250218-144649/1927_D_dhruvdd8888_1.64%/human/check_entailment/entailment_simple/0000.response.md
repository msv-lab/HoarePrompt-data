### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by first segmenting the array `nums` into consecutive segments of identical numbers. Each segment is represented as a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`, where `start_index` and `end_index` are the bounds of the segment and `value` is the number that repeats in that segment.

For each query, the code uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. It then checks the conditions to determine if a pair of different elements exists within the query range.

However, there are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Query Range**: The code incorrectly handles the query range `[l, r]`. Specifically:
   - It checks if the start of the segment is greater than `l`, which is not the correct condition to determine if there are different elements within the range.
   - It checks if the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, which is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - The logic for printing the indices `(s - 1, s)` or `(s, e + 1)` is flawed and does not guarantee that the indices are within the range `[l, r]` and that the elements at these indices are different.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same.

3. **Incorrect Debugging Statements**: The print statements inside the loop are used for debugging and do not contribute to solving the problem. The statement `print(nums)` is incorrect because `nums` should be defined within the `func_1` function.

4. **Unnecessary Appending of `-1`**: The line `nums.append(-1)` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because it modifies the input array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
