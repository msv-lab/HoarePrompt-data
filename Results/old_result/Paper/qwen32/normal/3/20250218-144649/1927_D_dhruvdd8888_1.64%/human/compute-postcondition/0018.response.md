The code snippet provided is:
```
num = nums[i]
```

This line of code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. The values of `t`, `N`, `i`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The variable `num` is updated to the value of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `num` is `nums[i]`, `arr` is unchanged if `nums[i]` equals `num`. Otherwise, `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 1, nums[i])` appended to it, and `s` is 1.**
