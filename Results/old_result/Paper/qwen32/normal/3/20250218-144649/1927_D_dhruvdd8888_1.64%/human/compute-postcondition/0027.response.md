To determine what will be printed by the `print(nums)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `N` is an integer read from the input.
- `i` is initialized to the value of `N`.
- `num` is initialized to `-1`.
- `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
- `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
- `ppp` is set to `23`.

However, the variable `nums` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. The description mentions that `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, but `nums` itself is not provided or initialized with any value.

Given the lack of an explicit definition for `nums`, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output of the `print(nums)` statement cannot be determined with a specific value.

Output: **nums (where nums is an undefined or uninitialized list of integers)**
