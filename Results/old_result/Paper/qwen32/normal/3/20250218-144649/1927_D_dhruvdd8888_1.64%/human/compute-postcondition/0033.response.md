To determine what will be printed by the `print(l, r)` statement, we need to focus on the values of `l` and `r` as described in the initial state.

The initial state specifies:
- `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple.

Since there is no specific value provided for `l` and `r` in the initial state, we can only state that they are integers that have been read from the input. Therefore, the output will be the values of `l` and `r` as they were read from the input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are integers read from the input)**
