Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `N` is an integer read from the input.
3. `i` is initialized to `N`.
4. `num` is initialized to `-1`.
5. `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
6. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
7. `l` and `r` are new integers read from the input as a tuple.
8. `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
9. `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
10. If `tc > 5`, the input value for the loop is decremented by 1 to ensure one more iteration. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(-1, -1)` directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, separated by a space. This is a straightforward print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided and will be printed as they are.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
