Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find two different indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a subarray defined by \(l\) and \(r\) such that \(a_i \neq a_j\). If such a pair does not exist, the program should output \(-1 -1\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, the number of queries, and then the queries.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The program segments the array into contiguous segments of identical elements. This is done with the help of a loop that iterates through the array and records the start and end indices of each segment along with the element value.
   - The segments are stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query.
   - Depending on the position of the found segment, the program attempts to find two different indices within the query range that correspond to different values.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Segments:**
  - The program does not correctly handle all cases where a valid pair of indices should be found.
  - The logic for checking segments and finding valid indices is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly check if there is a segment that ends before the right boundary of the query or if there is a segment that starts after the left boundary.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the subarray consists of only one unique element correctly.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has exactly two different elements.

### Detailed Analysis:
Let's delve deeper into the specific issues in the code:

1. **Segmentation Logic:**
   - The program creates segments of contiguous identical elements. This is fine in theory, but the way it uses these segments to answer queries is problematic.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query. This is not sufficient to determine if there are two different elements in the range `[l, r]`.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment found by `bisect_left` does not cover the entire range `[l, r]`.

3. **Output Logic:**
   - The program's logic for determining the output is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly handle cases where the segment found by `bisect_left` does not cover the entire range `[l, r]` and does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple segments within the range `[l, r]`.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

**Input:**
```
5
    
5
    
1 1 2 1 1
    
3
    
1 5
    
1 2
    
1 3
    
6
    
30 20 20 10 10 20
    
5
    
1 2
    
2 3
    
2 4
    
2 6
    
3 5
    
4
    
5 2 3 4
    
4
    
1 2
    
1 4
    
2 3
    
2 4
    
5
    
1 4 3 2 4
    
5
    
1 5
    
2 4
    
3 4
    
3 5
    
4 5
    
5
    
2 3 1 4 2
    
7
    
1 2
    
1 4
    
1 5
    
2 4
    
2 5
    
3 5
    
4 5
```

**Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
    
2 1
-1 -1
4 2
4 6
5 3
    
1 2
1 2
2 3
3 2
    
1 3
2 4
3 4
5 3
5 4
    
1 2
4 2
1 3
2 3
3 2
5 4
5 4
```

The program's output for the first test case is correct:
- For the query `1 5`, the output `2 3` is correct because `a_2 = 1` and `a_3 = 2` are different.
- For the query `1 2`, the output `-1 -1` is correct because all elements in the range are the same.
- For the query `1 3`, the output `1 3` is correct because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2` are different.

However, let's consider the second test case:
- For the query `1 2`, the output `2 1` is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1 -1` because all elements in the range are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there is only one unique element in the subarray defined by the query range. The logic for finding and verifying segments is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
