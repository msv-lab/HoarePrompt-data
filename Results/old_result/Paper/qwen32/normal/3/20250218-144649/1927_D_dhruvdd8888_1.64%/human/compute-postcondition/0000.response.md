The given code snippet only imports the `readline` function from the `sys.stdin` module. This does not change the values of any existing variables or introduce new variables with specific values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, except that the `readline` function is now available for use.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `input` is now `sys.stdin.readline`.**
