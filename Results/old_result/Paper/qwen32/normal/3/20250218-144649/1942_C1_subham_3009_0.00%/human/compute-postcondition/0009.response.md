Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers converted from the original substrings**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so if `t` was initially at least 1, it is now at least 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
