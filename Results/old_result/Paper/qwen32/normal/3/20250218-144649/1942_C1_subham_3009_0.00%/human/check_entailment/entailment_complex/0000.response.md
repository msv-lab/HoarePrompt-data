### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using a given set of vertices on a regular polygon. The number of additional vertices that can be chosen is zero in this version of the problem.

The function provided processes each test case by reading the number of sides of the polygon (`n`), the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (`x`), and the list of chosen vertices (`arr`). It then outputs `x - 2` for each test case.

To understand if this is correct, let's consider the geometric interpretation:
- When a convex polygon has `x` vertices chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using these `x` vertices is `x - 2`.
- This is a well-known result from computational geometry and combinatorial mathematics. For example, a triangle (`x = 3`) can form exactly one triangle (`3 - 2 = 1`), a quadrilateral (`x = 4`) can form exactly two triangles (`4 - 2 = 2`), and so on.

Given that `y = 0` (no additional vertices can be chosen), the function correctly computes the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using only the vertices Bessie has chosen.

### Conclusion:
The function `func()` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed based on the given vertices.

Correctness: **True**
