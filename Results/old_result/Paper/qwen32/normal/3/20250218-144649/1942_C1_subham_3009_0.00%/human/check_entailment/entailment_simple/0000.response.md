### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using a given set of vertices in a regular polygon. The number of additional vertices we can choose, `y`, is given as 0 in this version of the problem. 

The key insight is that with `x` vertices already chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` points can form at most `x - 2` non-intersecting triangles (a well-known result in combinatorial geometry).

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the list of `x` vertices. It then prints `x - 2` for each test case, which is the correct answer based on the problem's requirements.

Given the comments and the program's behavior, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
