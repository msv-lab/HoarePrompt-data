The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are unchanged.**
