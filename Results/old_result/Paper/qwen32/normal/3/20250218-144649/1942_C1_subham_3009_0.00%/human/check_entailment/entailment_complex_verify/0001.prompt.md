You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

        #State: t is 0, n is the n value from the last iteration, x is the x value from the last iteration, y is the y value from the last iteration, and arr is the list of integers from the last iteration.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. If the program is executed as the main module, then `t` is set to 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their values from the last iteration, and `arr` is the list of integers from the last iteration. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function outputs `x - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem described, but there are several issues with the logic and the implementation.

1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon. The number of sides of the polygon is `n`, and `x` vertices have already been chosen by Bessie. Since `y` is always 0, no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Key Insight:** Given that no additional vertices can be chosen (`y = 0`), the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is solely dependent on the vertices already chosen (`x`). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from `x` vertices in a convex polygon is `x - 2`. This is a well-known result in computational geometry.

3. **Program Analysis:**
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
    - It reads the list of `x` vertices.
    - It then prints `x - 2` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:** The program correctly calculates `x - 2` for each test case, which is the correct solution when `y = 0`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
