The code snippet `maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)` updates the value of `maxx` to be the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. Given that `minn` is 0 and `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, the expression `abs(arr[i] - minn)` simplifies to `abs(arr[i])`. Since `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `abs(arr[i])` is `-arr[i]` (which is a positive value). Therefore, `maxx` is updated to `-arr[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`, `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[i])`, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is `-arr[i]`, and `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0.**
