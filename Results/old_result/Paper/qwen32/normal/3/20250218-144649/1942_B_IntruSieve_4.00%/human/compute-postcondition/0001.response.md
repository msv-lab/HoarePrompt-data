The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
