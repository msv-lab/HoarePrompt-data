To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the outputs after the first 3 iterations.

### Loop Behavior Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is an empty list.
   - `minn` is 0.
   - `maxx` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `n` times (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`).

3. **For each iteration (`i` from 0 to `n-1`):**
   - If `arr[i] > 0`:
     - Append `minn` to `mex`.
     - Increment `minn` by 1.
     - If `minn` equals `maxx`, update `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`:
     - Append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
     - Update `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)` if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`.

### Output State after All Iterations

After the loop has run `n` times, the final state of the variables will be:

- **`mex`:** A list containing `n` elements, each determined by whether `arr[i]` is positive or non-positive.
- **`minn`:** The final value of `minn` after all iterations.
- **`maxx`:** The maximum value encountered in the `mex` list.

### Determining the Final Values

The final values of `minn` and `maxx` depend on the sequence of values in `arr`:

- **`minn`:** This value will increment by 1 each time `arr[i] > 0` and will be updated to `maxx + 1` whenever it equals `maxx`.
- **`maxx`:** This value will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` whenever `arr[i] <= 0`.

### Final Output State

Given the behavior and the initial conditions, the final output state is:

- `mex` will have `n` elements, each element being either `minn` (if `arr[i] > 0`) or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` (if `arr[i] <= 0`).
- `minn` will be the final counter value after all positive numbers in `arr` have been processed and adjusted.
- `maxx` will be the maximum value found in the `mex` list.

### Conclusion

Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is an integer, and `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `mex` will contain `n` elements derived from the conditions on `arr`, `minn` will be the final count adjusted by the loop's logic, and `maxx` will be the highest value in the `mex` list.
