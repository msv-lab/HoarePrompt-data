The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and the condition that `i` is incremented by 1 are not affected by this operation.

Given that `arr[i]` is an element from the list `arr` and `minn` is presumably the minimum value in some context (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is used in the code), the new element in `mex` will be the absolute value of the difference between these two.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `mex` has a new element which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)` appended to it.**
