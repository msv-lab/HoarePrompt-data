Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given list.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`. It then attempts to construct the permutation `p` by maintaining a list `mex` to store the constructed permutation. The program uses `minn` to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `mex`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Positive `a_i`**: If `a_i` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` again.
2. **Negative `a_i`**: If `a_i` is negative, the program appends `abs(a_i - minn)` to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the new value exceeds it.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Negative `a_i`**: The program calculates `abs(a_i - minn)` for negative `a_i` and appends it to `mex`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting `mex` will be a valid permutation because it does not ensure that the appended value is the smallest non-negative integer not already in `mex`.
2. **Tracking MEX**: The program does not correctly track the MEX of the current permutation. It uses `minn` and `maxx` in a way that does not necessarily reflect the true MEX of the constructed permutation up to that point.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly construct the permutation `p`:
1. Maintain a set of used numbers.
2. For each `a_i`, calculate the MEX of the current set of used numbers.
3. If `a_i` is positive, append the MEX to `p` and add it to the set of used numbers.
4. If `a_i` is negative, append `MEX + a_i` to `p` and add it to the set of used numbers.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Reasoning:** The program does not correctly track the MEX and handle negative values of `a_i` in a way that guarantees the constructed permutation `p` will satisfy the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

**Correctness:** **False**
