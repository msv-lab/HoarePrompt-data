The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mex` and `minn` and `maxx` are updated based on the conditions provided.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**
