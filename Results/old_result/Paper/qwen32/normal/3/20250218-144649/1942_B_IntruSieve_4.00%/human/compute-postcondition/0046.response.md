Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers for each test case. It processes the list to generate a new list `mex` based on specific rules involving positive and negative values in `a`. It then prints the elements of `mex` for each test case, followed by an empty line.**
