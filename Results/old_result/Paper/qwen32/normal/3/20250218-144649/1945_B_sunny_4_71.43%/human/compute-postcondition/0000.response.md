The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means the value of `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input, while the conditions about `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.**
