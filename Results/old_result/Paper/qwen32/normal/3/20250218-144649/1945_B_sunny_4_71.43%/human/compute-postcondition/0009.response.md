The code snippet provided is:

```python
B = int(m / b) + 1
```

This line reassigns the value of `B` based on the division of `m` by `b`, adding 1 to the integer part of the result. Given that `B` was previously defined with the same expression, reassigning it with the same expression does not change its value. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, and `A` retains its previously computed value.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**
