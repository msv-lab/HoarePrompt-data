Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by simply summing the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration (m + 1 minutes). However, this approach does not account for the possibility of fireworks from both installations being visible simultaneously at the same times.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Firework Launching Times:**
   - The first installation launches fireworks at times: a, 2a, 3a, ...
   - The second installation launches fireworks at times: b, 2b, 3b, ...

2. **Visibility Duration:**
   - Each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes. If a firework is launched at time x, it will be visible from time x to x + m, inclusive.

3. **Simultaneous Visibility:**
   - The program needs to consider the overlap of fireworks from both installations. If two fireworks are launched within m minutes of each other, they will be visible simultaneously for the overlap period.

4. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches.
   - For each period of LCM(a, b), we need to count how many fireworks from each installation are visible and then sum them up, taking care of overlaps.

The provided program does not handle the overlap scenario correctly and simply adds the number of fireworks from each installation, which is incorrect for cases where fireworks from both installations overlap in visibility.

Correctness: **False**
