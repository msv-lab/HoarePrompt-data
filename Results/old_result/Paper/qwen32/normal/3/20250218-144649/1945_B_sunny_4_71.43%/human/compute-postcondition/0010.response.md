Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is set to 1, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(A + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input Values**: The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not explicitly provided, so we'll refer to them as they are.
2. **Calculating `A`**: 
   - `A` is calculated using the formula `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `int(m / a)` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, which means it divides `m` by `a` and truncates the decimal part.
   - Adding 1 to the result of the integer division gives us `A`.
3. **Calculating `B`**:
   - `B` is calculated using the formula `int(m / b) + 1`.
   - `int(m / b)` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, which means it divides `m` by `b` and truncates the decimal part.
   - Adding 1 to the result of the integer division gives us `B`.
4. **Printing the Sum**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Output Description:
The output will be the sum of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **A + B (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**
