Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. The logic for calculating the number of triangles is flawed, and the handling of the circular nature of the polygon is not correctly implemented.

Here are some points to consider:
1. **Circular Nature of the Polygon**: The program does not correctly handle the circular nature of the polygon when calculating gaps between vertices. For example, if the vertices are 1 and n, the gap is 1, not n-1.
2. **Counting Triangles**: The program incorrectly adds triangles based on the gaps between vertices. It should consider the number of vertices that can be added to form triangles, not just the gaps.
3. **Sorting and Adding Vertices**: The logic for sorting and adding vertices to form triangles is not correct. The program should prioritize adding vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal way to add vertices to form the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.
