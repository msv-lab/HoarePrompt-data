Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `ii` is 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed or the first element that caused the loop to break; `ans` is `x + y - 1`; `tmp` is an empty list; the current element `a[i]` minus the previous element `a[i - 1]` equals 2.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `ans`, which has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
