Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer where `y` is reduced by the sum of `i - 1` for all `i` in `tmp` that were processed; `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed or the first element that caused the loop to break; `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, plus the sum of `i` for all `i` in `tmp` that were processed, plus `y`; `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is Initial `ans` + sum(tmp) + Initial `y` - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp); `y` is Initial `y` - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus the sum of `i - 1` for each `i` in `tmp` that it could accommodate, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + number of iterations`, `tt` remains unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on the initial conditions plus the sum of `i` for each `i` in `tmp` that it could accommodate, and `tmp` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is increased by `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
