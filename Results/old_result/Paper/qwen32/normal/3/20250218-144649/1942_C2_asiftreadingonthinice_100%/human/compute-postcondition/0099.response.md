The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tmp` and the current value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element being processed from `tmp`, and `tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `tmp`.

State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`.**
