Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is 2; `ans` is the result from the previous iteration. If `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0`, `tmp` is the list from the previous iteration with an additional element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` appended. Otherwise, `tmp` remains the list from the previous iteration.**
