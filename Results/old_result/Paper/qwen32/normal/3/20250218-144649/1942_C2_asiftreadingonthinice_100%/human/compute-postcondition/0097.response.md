Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the list `tmp` remains unchanged, and `i` retains its value as the next element in `tmp`. The only change is that the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
