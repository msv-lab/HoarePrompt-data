The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents a computed result based on the input parameters and list, ensuring that the final output does not exceed `n - 2`.
