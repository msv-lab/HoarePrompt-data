You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we can choose up to `y` additional vertices. The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using these vertices.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. However, not all sets of 3 vertices will form a triangle if they are not connected by diagonals or sides of the polygon in a non-intersecting way.
2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The diagonals we draw must not intersect each other.
3. **Maximizing Triangles**: The maximum number of triangles can be formed by ensuring that the vertices are chosen such that they can form the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of vertices is sorted to make it easier to analyze the gaps between consecutive vertices.
3. **Initial Triangles**: The program calculates an initial number of triangles that can be formed based on the gaps between consecutive vertices.
4. **Handling Gaps**: It handles gaps of size 2 and even gaps separately, adding to the count of triangles and adjusting the number of additional vertices `y` that can be used.
5. **Circular Nature**: It also considers the gap between the first and last vertex, treating the polygon as circular.
6. **Final Adjustment**: The program adjusts the final count of triangles based on the remaining `y` vertices and ensures the count does not exceed `n-2` (the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in a polygon).

### Potential Issues

The provided program seems to follow a logical approach to solve the problem. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Handling Gaps**: The program correctly handles gaps of size 2 and even gaps, but it might not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the polygon is small or when the vertices are distributed in a way that maximizes the number of triangles.
2. **Circular Nature**: The program correctly considers the circular nature of the polygon by handling the gap between the first and last vertex.
3. **Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment to ensure the count does not exceed `n-2` is correct.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it seems to follow a logical approach and handles the problem requirements correctly. However, without a comprehensive set of test cases, it is challenging to be 100% certain. Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, the program appears to be correct.
