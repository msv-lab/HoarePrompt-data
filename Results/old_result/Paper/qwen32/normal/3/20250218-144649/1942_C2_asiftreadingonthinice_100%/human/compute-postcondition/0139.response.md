Let's analyze the code step by step and determine the output state:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `x`, `y`, and `n` are input integers.
   - `ii` is `ii + 1`.
   - `tt` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is calculated based on conditions involving `a`, `x`, `y`, and `n`.
   - `tmp` is a list that depends on the conditions involving `a` and `n`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `tmp.sort()` sorts the list `tmp` in ascending order.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `tmp` is the only variable that changes. It gets sorted.
   - All other variables (`a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `ii`, `tt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - `a` is still a sorted list of integers.
   - `x`, `y`, `n` are still input integers.
   - `ii` is still `ii + 1`.
   - `tt` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains as it was calculated based on the initial conditions.
   - `tmp` is now a sorted list.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on the initial conditions, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers.**
