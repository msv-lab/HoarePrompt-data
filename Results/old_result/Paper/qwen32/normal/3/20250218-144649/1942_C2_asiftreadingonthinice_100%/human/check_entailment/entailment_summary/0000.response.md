### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function `func()` aligns with the problem statement and the provided example cases.

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing chosen vertices.
   - The list of chosen vertices is sorted to facilitate further calculations.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is based on the idea that each additional vertex can potentially form more triangles, but some adjustments are needed.
   - A temporary list `tmp` is used to store certain differences between consecutive vertices.

3. **Handling Consecutive Vertices**:
   - The program checks if consecutive chosen vertices are exactly two apart (`a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`). If so, it increments `ans` by 1 because such a pair can form additional triangles.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates half of the difference and appends it to `tmp`.

4. **Handling Wrap-around**:
   - The program also checks the difference between the first and last chosen vertices considering the wrap-around (`a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]`).
   - Similar to the previous step, if this difference is exactly 2, it increments `ans` by 1. If even, it calculates half of the difference and appends it to `tmp`.

5. **Sorting and Further Calculation**:
   - The list `tmp` is sorted.
   - The program iterates through `tmp` and adjusts `ans` based on the values in `tmp` and the remaining number of vertices `y` that can be chosen.
   - If `y` is sufficient to cover the difference minus one, it adds the difference to `ans` and reduces `y` accordingly.
   - If `y` is not sufficient, it breaks out of the loop.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program adds any remaining `y` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` to ensure the result does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles.

### Example Validation:
Let's validate the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- **Input**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 2`, vertices = `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
- **Expected Output**: `6`
- **Program Output**: `6`

#### Test Case 2:
- **Input**: `n = 7`, `x = 3`, `y = 1`, vertices = `[1, 3, 6]`
- **Expected Output**: `5`
- **Program Output**: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- **Input**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 2`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
- **Expected Output**: `2`
- **Program Output**: `2`

The program correctly computes the expected outputs for the provided test cases, indicating that the logic seems to be implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and validation with the provided example cases, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
