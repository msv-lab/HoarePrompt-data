You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it outputs the count of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the median element (or the middle element if `n` is odd, or the larger of the two middle elements if `n` is even). If `n` is 1, it simply outputs 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Median Calculation**:
   - For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element.
   - For an even-length array, the median is the smaller of the two middle elements.

2. **Objective**:
   - Increase the median of the array by the minimum number of operations.
   - Each operation consists of incrementing one element by 1.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
2. It sorts the array `a`.
3. It calculates the index `mdx` of the median element:
   - For an odd-length array, `mdx` is `n // 2`.
   - For an even-length array, `mdx` is `n // 2 - 1` (since the median is the smaller of the two middle elements).
4. It initializes a counter `res` to 0.
5. It iterates over the elements from the median index to the end of the array.
   - For each element equal to the median, it increments the counter `res`.
6. It prints the counter `res` as the result.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Median Index Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the median index `mdx` for both odd and even-length arrays.
- **Logic to Increase the Median**:
  - The program counts the number of elements equal to the median. However, this count does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
  - To increase the median, we need to make sure that the new median is greater than the current median. This can be achieved by incrementing elements, but the program's logic is flawed.
  - The program should increment the smallest elements to push the median up, not just count the number of elements equal to the current median.

### Correct Approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median.
3. To increase the median, increment the smallest elements until the median increases.
4. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently increment the smallest elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic is flawed, and a different approach is required.
