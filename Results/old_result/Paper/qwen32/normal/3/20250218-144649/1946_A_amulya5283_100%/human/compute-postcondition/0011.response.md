The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`.

Given that `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, we need to ensure that `mdx` is less than `n` for the loop to execute. Let's analyze the expression for `mdx`:

- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2`.

In both cases, `mdx` is always less than `n` because `mdx` is essentially the middle index or one position before the middle in the list, and the loop starts from `mdx` and goes up to `n-1`.

Since `n` is given to be at least 2 and at most \(10^5\), `mdx` will always be a valid starting index for the loop. Therefore, the state of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Thus, the only state that needs to be ensured is that `n` is at least 2 (which is already given in the problem statement).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**
