The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. Given the loop statement `for i in range(mdx, n):`, we need to adjust the state to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to increase `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

The variables `mdx` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**
