The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mdx + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `mdx + 2`. The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 2` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is `res + 1`.**
