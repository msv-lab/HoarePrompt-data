Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each test case. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        res = 0
        mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
        for i in range(mdx, n):
            if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                res += 1
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` is 1, the program does not modify `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` is 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the user input. If `n` is 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
