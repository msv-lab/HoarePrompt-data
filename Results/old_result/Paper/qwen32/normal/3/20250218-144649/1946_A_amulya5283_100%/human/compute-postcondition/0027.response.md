The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means that the previous list stored in `a` is replaced with the new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is the number of integers in the list `a`, and `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the value of `n` will be equal to the length of the newly input list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the newly input list `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9**.
