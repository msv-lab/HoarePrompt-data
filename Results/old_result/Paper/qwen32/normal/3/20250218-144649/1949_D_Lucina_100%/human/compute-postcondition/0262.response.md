Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is set to 'S'. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.**
