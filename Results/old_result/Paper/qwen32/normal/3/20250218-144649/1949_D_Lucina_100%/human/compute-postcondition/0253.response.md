The code snippet `nx += 'S'` attempts to concatenate the string `'S'` to the variable `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, which means this code will raise a `NameError`. Since the code execution cannot proceed due to this error, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 3**.
