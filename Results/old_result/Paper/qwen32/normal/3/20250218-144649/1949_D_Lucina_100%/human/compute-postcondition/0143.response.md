The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the variable `nx`. The initial state of `nx` is not provided, so we can only determine that it will have 'S' appended to it. The values of `sa`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` has 'S' appended to its initial value.**
