### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem by filling in the undecided transition videos ('?') with either 'F' or 'S' while ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type occur in any permutation of the scenarios.

However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the program:

1. **Counting Logic**: The program uses two lists `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' videos for each scenario. This is correct, but the logic for deciding which scenarios should be assigned 'F' or 'S' based on these counts is flawed.

2. **Decision Logic**: The program attempts to categorize scenarios into two groups, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have 'F' or 'S' videos but not both. It then tries to balance these groups, but the logic is not robust enough to ensure the required constraints are met.

3. **Handling '?'**: The program does not handle '?' characters in a way that guarantees the constraints are met for all permutations. Specifically, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters is based on the initial counts and some conditions that do not guarantee the required maximum consecutive constraint.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases or scenarios where the counts of 'F' and 'S' are already close to the maximum allowed consecutive count, which could lead to incorrect assignments.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee that the output will meet the problem's constraints for all possible permutations of the scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type occur in any permutation of the scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
