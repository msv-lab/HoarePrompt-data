Let's analyze the program step-by-step according to the problem description and the provided code.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of scenarios, `n`.
   - It then reads `n` lines representing the current transition plan. Each line contains `n` characters, where each character can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario).

2. **Counting Funny and Scary Transitions:**
   - Two arrays `a` and `b` are used to count the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - For each character in the input, if it's 'F', both `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented. Similarly, if it's 'S', both `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only Funny or Scary Transitions:**
   - Two lists, `sa` and `sb`, are created to store scenarios that have only funny transitions (`a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0`) and only scary transitions (`b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0`), respectively.

4. **Deciding Remaining Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`sb`), the remaining undecided transitions are filled as follows:
     - Scenarios with no transitions yet (both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0) are added to `sa`.
     - For each scenario, if the transition to another scenario is undecided ('?'), the program checks if either scenario is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`. If so, it assigns 'F'; otherwise, it assigns 'S'.
   - If `sb` has more elements than `sa`, the same logic is applied, but 'S' and 'F' are swapped.

5. **Output:**
   - The program constructs and prints the full transition plan, replacing '?' with 'F' or 'S' as per the above logic.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic for Transition Assignment:**
  - The program uses a very simplistic heuristic to assign 'F' or 'S' to undecided transitions based on the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `sb`. This heuristic does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will not have more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.
  - The program does not ensure that the constraints are met for all possible permutations of scenarios, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion

The given program does not guarantee that the output will satisfy the requirement of no more than `\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil` consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**
