The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, which means `i` will take values from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `nx`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `nx` is 'FSF'**
