Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF']. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `sa` contains a list of `n` strings, where each string is of length `n` and constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` according to the conditions: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', append it; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', append 'F' if `i` or `j` (or both) are in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, append 'S'. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged as empty lists.**
