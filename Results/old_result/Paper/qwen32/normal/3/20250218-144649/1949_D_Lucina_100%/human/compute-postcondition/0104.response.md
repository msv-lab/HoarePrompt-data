The code provided attempts to append the value of `i` to a list named `sa`, but `sa` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, this code would normally raise a `NameError`. However, since the task is to simulate the execution and provide an output state, we will assume that `sa` is a list that exists in the context not provided in the initial state. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `sa` was an empty list before this operation.

Given this assumption, the value of `i` (which is 1) will be appended to `sa`.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `i` is 1, `sa` is [1]**
