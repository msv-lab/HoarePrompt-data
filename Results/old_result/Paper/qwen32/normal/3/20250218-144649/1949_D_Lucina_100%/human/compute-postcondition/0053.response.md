The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increases the value at index `j` in the list `a` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the element at index 3 in the list `a` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and the element at index `i` in the list `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and the element at index `i` in the list `a` is increased by 1; the element at index 3 in the list `a` is increased by 1.**
