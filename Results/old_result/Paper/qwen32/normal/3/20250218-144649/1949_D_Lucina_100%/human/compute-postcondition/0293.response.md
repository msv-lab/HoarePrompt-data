Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 24) and a grid of n lines, each containing n characters. Each character in the grid is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing different types of transition videos or no transition. The function returns a result based on the configuration of these characters, ensuring there are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters.**
