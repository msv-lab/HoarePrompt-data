The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string variable `nx`. The values of `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition that either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is `nx` + 'S', and either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`.**
