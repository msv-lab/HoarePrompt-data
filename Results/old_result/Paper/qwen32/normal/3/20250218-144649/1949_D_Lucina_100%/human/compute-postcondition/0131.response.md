The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will be equal to 'S'. The other variables `sa`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**
