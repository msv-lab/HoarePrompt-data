The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that. According to the loop statement, `j` ranges from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been some value between 1 and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `n`.

So, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `j`, we can assume that `j` has just finished an iteration and is about to start the next one. Therefore, we increment `j` by 1.

State: **`nx` is a string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` contains the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is present in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'S', `j` is incremented by 1**
