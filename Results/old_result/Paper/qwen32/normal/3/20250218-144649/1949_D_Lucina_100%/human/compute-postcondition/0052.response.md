The given code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is at least 3 and `j` is 3, but it does not provide any information about the list `a` or the value of `i`. Therefore, the only variable that changes is the element at index `i` in the list `a`, which increases by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and the element at index `i` in the list `a` is increased by 1.**
