The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range `(1, n + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `2`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[n + 1][0]`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string ending with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended.**
