The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at a value that has just completed an iteration, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `j` is the loop variable and it ranges from 1 to `n` inclusive, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`x` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1**
