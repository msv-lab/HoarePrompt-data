The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure that the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `j` is the loop variable and is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so we do not need to set it before the loop starts. However, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value that will allow the loop to run at least once.

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
