The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is 3
- `i` is 3 (which is the last iteration)

Since `i` is currently at 3 and `n` is also 3, the loop will not execute again because `i` will not be less than `n + 1` (which is 4) after the next increment.

However, if we are to consider the state right before the loop terminates, we need to reflect the state where `i` is about to be incremented to 4, which is the point where the loop condition fails.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the point right before the loop exits) would be:
- `n` remains 3
- `i` is incremented to 4 (but the loop will not execute with this value of `i`)

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 4**
