The code snippet provided is `nx += 'F'`. However, the initial state does not include a variable named `nx`. Given this, we can assume there might be a typo or missing information. Since the task specifies adhering strictly to the provided initial state and code, and `nx` is not part of the initial state, we cannot update or include `nx` in the output state.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that no changes have been made to the variables provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 4**.
