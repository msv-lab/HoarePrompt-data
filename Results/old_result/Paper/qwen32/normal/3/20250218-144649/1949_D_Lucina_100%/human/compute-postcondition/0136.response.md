`nx` is updated by appending the character 'F' to its current value. The values of `sa`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `nx` has 'F' appended to it.

Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is `nx` + 'F'**.
