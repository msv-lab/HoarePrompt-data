Output State: **`n` is 3, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` has been updated to include 'F' at the end.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains 3. The value of `xx[i][j - 1]` remains '?'. The conditions that `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` are still valid. The variable `nx` has been updated to include 'F' at the end.
