The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`, which was initially an empty string. The values of `sa`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**
