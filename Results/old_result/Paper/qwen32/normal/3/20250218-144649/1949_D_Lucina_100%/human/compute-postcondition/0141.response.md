Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2, so `nx` is increased by `xx[i][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
