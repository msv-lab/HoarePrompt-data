To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, we need to identify the value of the variable `nx` based on the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is 3
- `a` is the list `[1, 3, 4, 4]`
- `b` is the list `[1, 2, 3, 3]`
- `xx` is the list `['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF']`
- `sa` is an empty list `[]`
- `sb` is an empty list `[]`
- `i` is 2
- `nx` is `'SSF'`

From this information, we can see that `nx` is explicitly defined as `'SSF'`. Therefore, the `print(nx)` statement will output the value of `nx`, which is `'SSF'`.

Output: **SSF**
