Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', the value at index `i` in list `a` is increased by 1, and the value at index 2 in list `a` is increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[i]` is incremented by 1 and `b[2]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b[i]` or `b[2]`.**
