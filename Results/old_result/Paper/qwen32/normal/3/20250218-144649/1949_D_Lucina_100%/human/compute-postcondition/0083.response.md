Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to `j + 1`, `xx`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `b[j]` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged except for `j`, which has already been incremented before the code snippet, and `b[i]`, which was incremented previously as well.
