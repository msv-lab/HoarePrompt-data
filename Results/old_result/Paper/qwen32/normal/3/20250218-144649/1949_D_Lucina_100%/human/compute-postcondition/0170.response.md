Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'F' appended. Otherwise, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[n + 1][0]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and `i` or `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended. Additionally, in the else case, `nx` has 'S' appended to it.**

To summarize, after the if-else block executes:
- `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2.
- If `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` will have 'F' appended.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[n + 1][0]`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and `i` or `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` will have 'S' appended.
- In the else case, `nx` will have 'S' appended regardless of the condition on `xx[i][j - 1]`.**
