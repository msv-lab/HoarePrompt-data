The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.

The output state will have `nx` updated to its previous value plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. All other conditions and values remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`**.
