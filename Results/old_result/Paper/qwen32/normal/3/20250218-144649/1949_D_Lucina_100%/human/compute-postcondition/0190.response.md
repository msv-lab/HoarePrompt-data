Postcondition: **`nx` is a string with either 'F' or 'S' appended to it, depending on whether `i` or `j` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` (before appending) contains the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` (before appending) is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is present in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` (before appending) is 'S'. `j` is incremented by 1.**
