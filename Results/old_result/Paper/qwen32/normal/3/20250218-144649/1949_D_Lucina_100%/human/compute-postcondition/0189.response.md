Output State: **`nx` is a string with 'S' appended to it, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` (before appending 'S') contains the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` (before appending 'S') is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is present in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` (before appending 'S') is 'S', `j` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the string `nx` now has 'S' added to the end of it. The conditions and values of `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and `j` remain as described in the initial state, with `j` being incremented by 1.
