Output State: **`nx` is a string that includes either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?') or 'F' or 'S' (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', depending on whether `i` or `j` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), followed by 'F'; `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is now `j + 1`.**

Natural language: The string `nx` now has an additional character 'F' appended to it. The conditions for the initial part of `nx` remain the same. The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.
