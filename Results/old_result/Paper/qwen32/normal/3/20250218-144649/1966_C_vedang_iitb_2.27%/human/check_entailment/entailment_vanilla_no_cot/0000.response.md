Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not align with the game's mechanics of subtracting the same number of stones from each non-empty pile.

Here's a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. **Observation**: The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If it is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy when both play optimally.

2. **Implementation**: Compute the XOR of all pile sizes. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, piles in test_cases:
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum != 0:
            results.append("Alice")
        else:
            results.append("Bob")
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (2, [1, 7]),
    (7, [1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]),
    (3, [1, 2, 3]),
    (6, [2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 4]),
    (8, [5, 7, 2, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2]),
    (1, [1000000000])
]

results = determine_winner(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This program correctly computes the winner for each test case by calculating the XOR-sum of the pile sizes.
