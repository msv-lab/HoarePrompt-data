The given code snippet calls a function `func_2` with the arguments `a[1:]` and `n - 1`, and assigns the result to the variable `winNext`. This means that `winNext` will hold the value returned by `func_2` when called with these arguments.

The list `a` is reduced by removing the first element (i.e., `a[1:]`), and the integer `n` is decremented by 1 (i.e., `n - 1`). The function `func_2` is assumed to return a value based on these new arguments, which is then stored in `winNext`.

Since the specific behavior of `func_2` is not provided, we can only describe the changes to `winNext` and the modified arguments passed to `func_2`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile starting from the second pile, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n - 1 < len(a) + 1, `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` holds the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.
