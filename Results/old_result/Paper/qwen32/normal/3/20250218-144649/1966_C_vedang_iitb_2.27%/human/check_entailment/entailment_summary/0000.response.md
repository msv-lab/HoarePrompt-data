### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze each function and their roles in solving the problem.

**Problem Analysis:**
The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players remove stones from piles, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this problem is to determine the winning strategy based on the number of piles and their stone counts.

**Function `func_1`:**
- This function takes a list of integers `a`, representing the number of stones in each pile.
- It first creates a sorted list of unique elements from `a`.
- Then, it computes the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted list.
- The output is a list of these differences, which is used to simplify the game state for the next function.

However, the transformation done by `func_1` does not seem to directly correspond to any known strategy for solving the Nim game or its variants. The differences between unique stone counts do not provide a clear indication of the game's state or help in determining the winner.

**Function `func_2`:**
- This function determines the winner based on the transformed list `a` and its length `n`.
- It uses recursion to analyze the game state:
  - If there's only one pile (`n == 1`), the first player (Alice) wins.
  - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), it checks if the first pile has an even number of stones. If so, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
  - For more than two piles, it recursively determines the winner of the game with one less pile. If the next player can force a win (`winNext == 2`) or if the current player can force a win by ensuring the next player faces a losing position (`winNext == 1` and the current pile count is not 1), the current player wins.

The logic in `func_2` is not entirely correct for the problem at hand. The Nim game's winning strategy is based on the XOR (Nim-sum) of the pile sizes, not on the differences between unique pile sizes or simple parity checks.

**Conclusion:**
The provided functions do not correctly implement the strategy to determine the winner of the game. The transformation in `func_1` does not align with any known approach for solving this problem, and `func_2` does not correctly determine the winner based on the Nim-sum or any other optimal strategy.
