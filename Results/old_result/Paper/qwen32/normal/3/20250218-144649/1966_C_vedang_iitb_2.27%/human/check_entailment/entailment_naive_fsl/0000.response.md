Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but neither of these functions appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and then computes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, it is not clear how this transformation helps in determining the winner of the game.

2. **Function `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - This function seems to be attempting to determine the winner recursively.
   - It handles base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` but the logic for `n > 2` is not correct.
   - The logic inside the `else` block does not correctly account for the optimal moves that both players would make.

### Issues with the Logic:
- The problem can be solved using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR sum) from combinatorial game theory. The winner of the game can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
- The provided code does not implement this logic, and instead, it uses a recursive approach that does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of the players.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The correct output should be "Alice" because the XOR of 1, 2, and 3 is 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, which means Bob wins if both play optimally.
- However, the provided code will not produce the correct output for this case.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be to calculate the XOR of all pile sizes and determine the winner based on the result:
```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case[0]
        piles = case[1]
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum == 0:
            results.append("Bob")
        else:
            results.append("Alice")
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 1
test_cases = [(3, [1, 2, 3])]
print(determine_winner(t, test_cases))  # Output should be ["Bob"]
```

Since the provided code does not implement the correct logic, the Correctness is False.
