You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a variant where players can remove a positive number of stones from each non-empty pile in a single turn, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The optimal play in such games often involves the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. However, the provided program seems to use a different approach.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1(a)`

- **Purpose**: This function appears to transform the list of pile sizes into a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
- **Implementation**:
  - `a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))` : This creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.
  - `a_temp = a_new.copy()` : A copy of the sorted unique pile sizes is made.
  - The loop `for i in range(1, len(a_new))` modifies `a_new` such that each element (except the first) is the difference between the current element and the previous one in the sorted unique list.
- **Output**: A list where each element (except the first) is the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes.

#### Function `func_2(a, n)`

- **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game for a given set of piles.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Base Cases**:
    - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins.
    - If there are two piles (`n == 2`):
      - If the first pile size is even, Alice wins.
      - If the first pile size is odd, Bob wins.
  - **Recursive Case**:
    - `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` : Recursively determine the winner for the game excluding the first pile.
    - The function then decides the winner based on the outcome of the recursive call and the size of the first pile.
- **Output**: Returns `1` if Alice wins and `2` if Bob wins.

### Evaluation

The program's logic does not align with the optimal strategy for the game, which involves the Nim-sum. The base cases and recursive logic in `func_2` do not correctly determine the winner for all possible configurations of piles.

For example:
- In the third test case, the piles are `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`. The correct strategy involves calculating the Nim-sum of these numbers, which is `1 ^ 3 ^ 9 ^ 7 ^ 4 ^ 2 ^ 100 = 128`. Since the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. However, the provided program does not use this approach and may incorrectly determine the winner.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

Correctness: **False**
