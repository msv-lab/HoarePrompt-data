Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements with `v1` removed, `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v1, v2)`.**

In simpler terms: The list `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
