The code snippet removes `v3` from the set `vx`. Given that `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, and `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, after the removal, `vx` will no longer contain `v3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v1` and `v3`; `ops` is an empty list; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`.**
