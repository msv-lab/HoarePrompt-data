In the provided loop, the loop head iterates over the reversed list `ops[::-1]`. The variables `v1` and `v2` are assigned to elements of the tuples in `ops`. To ensure the loop executes, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables in the loop head**: `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops` are the relevant variables.
2. **Condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `ops` contains at least one tuple. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. **State of `vx`, `p1`, and `p2`**: These variables are not directly related to the execution of the loop. Their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted so that `ops` contains at least one tuple.

**Answer:**

State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations and must contain at least one tuple; `p1` contains the two integers from `vx`; `p2` is an empty list.**
