Let's analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations and must contain at least one tuple.
- `p1` contains the two integers from `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.

Code snippet:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

The code snippet checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If true, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Since `v1` and `v2` are not defined in the initial state, we must assume that `v1` and `v2` are provided during the execution, and we will consider their values in the output state.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios:

1. If `p1[-1] == v2`:
   - `p2` will have `v1` appended to it.
   - `p1` remains unchanged.

2. If `p1[-1] != v2`:
   - `p1` will have `v1` appended to it.
   - `p2` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, `p1` contains two integers from `vx`, and `p2` is an empty list. After the execution of the code, the state will be updated based on the condition.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations and must contain at least one tuple; if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` contains `[v1]` and `p1` remains unchanged; if `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` contains the original two integers plus `v1` and `p2` remains an empty list.**

In simpler terms:
- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is added to `p2`, and `p1` stays the same.
- If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is added to `p1`, and `p2` remains empty.
