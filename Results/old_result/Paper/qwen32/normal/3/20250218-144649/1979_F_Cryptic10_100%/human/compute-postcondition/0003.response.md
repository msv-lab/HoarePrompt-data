To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head: `len(vx) > 2`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Relevant Variables**: The loop condition depends on the length of the set `vx`. Therefore, `vx` is the only variable we need to adjust.
2. **Understand the Condition**: The loop will execute if the length of `vx` is greater than 2.
3. **Current State of `vx`**: According to the provided state, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`. This means `vx` currently has `n` elements.
4. **Adjustment Requirement**: For the loop to execute, `vx` must have more than 2 elements. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` will naturally have more than 2 elements as long as `n` is at least 3. However, if `n` is 2 or less, `vx` will not satisfy the condition.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 3 so that `len(vx)` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n; `ops` is an empty list.**
