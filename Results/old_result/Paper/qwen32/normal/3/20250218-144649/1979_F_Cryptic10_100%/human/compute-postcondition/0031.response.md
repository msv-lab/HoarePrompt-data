In the given task, the for loop iterates over the reversed list `ops[::-1]`. The loop head involves the tuple unpacking `(v1, v2)` which will take values from each tuple in the reversed `ops` list during each iteration. Therefore, the only objects in the loop head that we can adjust are `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`.

To ensure the loop executes, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. Since the loop iterates over the reversed `ops`, the state of `v1` and `v2` before the loop starts does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it will be set to the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list during the first iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `ops` has at least one tuple.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to n, `ops` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list**
