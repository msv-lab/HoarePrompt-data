Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n; `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v1` (and `v3` if `v2` ≤ 0); `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` ≤ 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` must be greater than 4. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` ≤ 0). `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2)]` if `v2` > 0, otherwise it contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is removed from `vx` and `ops` also contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` and `_` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` must be at least 5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`. If `v2` > 0, `v3` is not removed from `vx` and `ops` contains the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2), (v1, v2)]`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is removed from `vx` and `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is also the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
