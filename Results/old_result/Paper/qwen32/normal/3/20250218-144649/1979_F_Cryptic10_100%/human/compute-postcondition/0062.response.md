The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are not changed by this operation, and they are determined by the function call `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal of elements from `vx`. The conditions regarding `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain unchanged except for the update to `ops`.

Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1`; `v1` and `v3` are such that only one of them (or neither) is excluded from the updated `vx`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal; `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` appended to it.**
