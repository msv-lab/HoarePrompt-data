The code snippet appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `v1` and `v2` are already defined as the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. Therefore, `ops` will now include an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`.

The other variables (`n`, `vx`, `v1`, `v2`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and constraints.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v3` (if `v2` â‰¤ 0), and `v1` has been removed from `vx`; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2), (v1, v2)]` if `v2` > 0, otherwise it contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v1, v2)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.**
