In the given task, the loop is controlled by the integer `n`, which is obtained from the input. The loop will execute for a number of times equal to the integer value of `n`. The state before the loop starts includes the value of `n` that will be obtained from the input. Since the loop iterates `n` times based on the input, the state of `n` is crucial for the loop to execute.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the integer value read from the input.
2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
3. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted based on the provided information is `n`, which is obtained from the input.

Since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head and `n` is the only such object, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid integer input that will allow the loop to execute the required number of times.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5**
