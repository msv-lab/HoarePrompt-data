Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` â‰¤ 0), with `v3` removed, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, `v3` and `_` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 4. The set `vx` no longer contains `v3`, as it has been removed. The list `ops` remains unchanged based on the conditions involving `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, and `_` are still the values returned by the function `q` as described.
