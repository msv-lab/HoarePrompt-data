Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` â‰¤ 0), `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, `v3` and `_` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.**

In natural language: The value of `v3` and an unused variable `_` are set to the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`. The other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `vx`, `ops`, `v1`, and `v2`.
