The only objects in the loop head are `v1` and `v2`, which are obtained from the `ops` list in reverse order. Therefore, we need to adjust these two variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `ops` is being iterated in reverse order (`ops[::-1]`), the state at the start of the next iteration will involve the next pair `(v1, v2)` from the `ops` list.

Let's denote the current state at the end of the previous iteration as follows:
- `p1` and `p2` are lists that have been modified based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.
- `ops` is a list of tuples that contains the pairs `(v1, v2)`.

Since the loop is iterating over `ops` in reverse order, the next iteration will involve the next tuple in `ops` when read in the forward direction.

**State Adjustment:**
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide the exact values of `v1` and `v2` for the next iteration, but we know they will be the next pair in `ops` when read in the forward direction.
- `p1` and `p2` remain as they are at the end of the previous iteration unless modified by the loop body, which is not provided here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`p1` and `p2` are as they are at the end of the previous iteration, and `(v1, v2)` is the next pair in `ops` when read in the forward direction.**
