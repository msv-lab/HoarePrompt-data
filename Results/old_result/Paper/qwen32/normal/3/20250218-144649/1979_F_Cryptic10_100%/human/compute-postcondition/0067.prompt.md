Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input number (inclusive); `ops` is an empty list; `p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` will contain any integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 3 excluding `v1` (and possibly `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0). `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, otherwise it is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` contains any integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(1)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 4 excluding `v1` (and possibly `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0). `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, otherwise it is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, with an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or additional tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` contains any integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and is excluded from `vx` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal. If `v2 > 0`, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` appended to it. Otherwise, `vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1` and `v3`, where `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`; `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v3` are such that only one of them (or neither) is excluded from the updated `vx`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
