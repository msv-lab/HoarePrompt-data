The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now include this additional tuple at the end.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` ≤ 0).
- `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
- `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.

After executing the code snippet, the list `ops` will have one additional tuple `(v1, v2)` appended to it. Therefore, if `v2` was already greater than 0, `ops` will now contain two tuples: the original `(v1, v2)` and the newly appended `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` was not greater than 0, `ops` will now contain the original tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` plus the newly appended `(v1, v2)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` ≤ 0); `ops` contains the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2)]` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v1, v2)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.**
