The code snippet `vx.remove(v1)` removes the first occurrence of `v1` from the list `vx`. Given that `vx` must have at least 3 elements initially, and `v1` is one of the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, after the removal, `vx` will have one less element than it did before the removal. The conditions regarding `v1` and `v3` (that only one of them, or neither, is excluded from `vx`) and the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` remain valid, but `v1` is no longer in `vx`.

Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1`; `v1` and `v3` are such that only one of them (or neither) is excluded from the updated `vx`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal.**
