The code snippet appends two tuples to the list `ops`. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`. Given the initial state, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)` and `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The other variables, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2`, remain unchanged. The list `vx` has two fewer elements, specifically `v1` and `v3` have been removed.

After executing the code, `ops` will have two additional elements: `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`vx` has two less elements, specifically `v1` and `v3` have been removed; `ops` has two additional elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`; `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged; `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`; `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`**.
