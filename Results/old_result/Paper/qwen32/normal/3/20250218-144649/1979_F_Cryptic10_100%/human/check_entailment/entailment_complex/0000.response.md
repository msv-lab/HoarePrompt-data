### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem by interactively querying the structure of the graph and determining a Hamiltonian path based on the responses. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a set `vx` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It also initializes an empty list `ops` to store operations (pairs of vertices) that will help in constructing the Hamiltonian path.

2. **Querying the Graph**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until only two vertices are left in the set `vx`.
   - In each iteration, it queries the graph with `"? d"`, where `d` is `len(vx) - 2`. This query helps in identifying a vertex `v1` with a degree at least `d` and another vertex `v2` that is not connected to `v1`.
   - The vertex `v1` is removed from the set `vx`.
   - If `v2` is greater than 0, it means `v2` is not connected to `v1`, and the pair `(v1, v2)` is added to `ops`.
   - If `v2` is 0, it means no such vertex exists, so the program queries again with `"? 0"` to find a vertex `v3` with the minimum degree. This vertex `v3` is removed from `vx`, and the pairs `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are added to `ops`.

3. **Constructing the Hamiltonian Path**:
   - After the loop, the set `vx` contains exactly two vertices, `p1`.
   - The program initializes an empty list `p2` to store the vertices that will be added to the path in reverse order.
   - It then processes the operations stored in `ops` in reverse order. For each operation `(v1, v2)`, it appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on whether the last vertex in `p1` matches `v2`.
   - Finally, the program constructs the Hamiltonian path by concatenating `p1` in reverse order with `p2` and outputs it in the required format.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Queries**:
  - The queries are designed to identify vertices with specific degrees and their non-adjacent vertices, which helps in constructing the Hamiltonian path.
  - The program ensures that it does not exceed `n` queries per test case, as required.

- **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by resetting the set `vx` and list `ops` for each test case.

- **Output Format**:
  - The final Hamiltonian path is output in the correct format, ensuring that each vertex is included exactly once.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine a Hamiltonian path for each test case within the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: **True**
