Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), and `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}`. The loop or conditional statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms: The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, and `mapping` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or conditional statement is exited.
