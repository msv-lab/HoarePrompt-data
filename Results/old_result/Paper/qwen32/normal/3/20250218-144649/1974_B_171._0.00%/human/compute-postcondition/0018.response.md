Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry `'b': char` if added), `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` includes the entry `'b': char`.**
