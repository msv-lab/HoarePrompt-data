To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `encoded`: A string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `mapping`: An empty dictionary.
   - `decoded`: An empty list.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each character `char` in `encoded`:
     - If `char` is already in `mapping`, append `mapping[char]` to `decoded`.
     - If `char` is not in `mapping`, find the first lowercase letter `c` ('a' to 'z') that is not yet a value in `mapping`. Set `mapping[chr(c)] = char` and append `chr(c)` to `decoded`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - `decoded` will contain a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique letter from 'a' to 'z' in the order they appear.
   - `mapping` will have a mapping from each unique letter in the transformed `decoded` string back to the corresponding original character in `encoded`.

### Example:
Suppose `encoded = "abcabc"`.

- **Iteration 1 (char = 'a'):**
  - 'a' not in `mapping`, so `mapping` becomes `{'a': 'a'}` and `decoded` becomes `['a']`.
  
- **Iteration 2 (char = 'b'):**
  - 'b' not in `mapping`, so `mapping` becomes `{'a': 'a', 'b': 'b'}` and `decoded` becomes `['a', 'b']`.
  
- **Iteration 3 (char = 'c'):**
  - 'c' not in `mapping`, so `mapping` becomes `{'a': 'a', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'c'}` and `decoded` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
  
- **Iteration 4 (char = 'a'):**
  - 'a' in `mapping`, so `decoded` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']`.
  
- **Iteration 5 (char = 'b'):**
  - 'b' in `mapping`, so `decoded` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b']`.
  
- **Iteration 6 (char = 'c'):**
  - 'c' in `mapping`, so `decoded` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'c']`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, `decoded` will be a list where each character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' based on the order of their first appearance in `encoded`. `mapping` will map each unique character in `decoded` back to its corresponding character in `encoded`.

Output State: **`decoded` is a list of characters where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance, and `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `decoded` back to its corresponding character in `encoded`.**
