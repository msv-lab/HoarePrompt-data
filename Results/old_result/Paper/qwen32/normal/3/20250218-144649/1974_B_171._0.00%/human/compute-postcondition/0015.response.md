The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` takes on integer values from 97 to 122, representing the ASCII values of the lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character.
- `decoded` is an empty list.
- `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added).
- If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}` and the loop or conditional statement is broken out of.
- If `chr(c)` was already in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- Since `c` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we need to increment `c` by 1 to proceed to the next character in the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), `c` is `c + 1`**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `c` at the end of the previous iteration, we can't specify a concrete value for `c + 1`. But we know it will be the next integer in the range from 97 to 122.

So, if `c` was 97 (representing 'a') at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 98 (representing 'b') at the start of the next iteration. If `c` was 98, it will be 99, and so on.

To generalize:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), `c` is the next integer in the range from 97 to 122**.

If we assume `c` was 97 at the end of the previous iteration, then:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), `c` is 98**.

If `c` was 98 at the end of the previous iteration, then:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), `c` is 99**.

And so on. For the sake of the general answer, we can say:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), `c` is the next integer in the range from 97 to 122**.

However, if we need a specific example, assuming `c` was 97 at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added), `c` is 98**.
