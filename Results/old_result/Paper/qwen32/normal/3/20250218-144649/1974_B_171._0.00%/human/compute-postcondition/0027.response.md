Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_char`, `c` is unchanged, and `mapping[chr(c)]` is `char`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `encoded`, `char`, `c`, and `mapping[chr(c)]` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
