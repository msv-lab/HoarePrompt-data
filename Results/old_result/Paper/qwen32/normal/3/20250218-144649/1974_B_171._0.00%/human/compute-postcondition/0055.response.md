To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over the ASCII values of the lowercase Latin letters from 'a' (ASCII 97) to 'z' (ASCII 122). For each character, it checks if the character is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. If it finds such a character, it adds an entry to `mapping` with the character as the key and `char` as the value, and then breaks out of the loop.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- After the first iteration (`c` is 97), if `'a'` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` gets the entry `{'a': char}` and the loop breaks. If `'a'` is already a value in `mapping`, the loop continues.
- After the second iteration (`c` is 98), if `'b'` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` gets the entry `{'b': char}` and the loop breaks. If `'b'` is already a value in `mapping`, the loop continues.
- After the third iteration (`c` is 99), if `'c'` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` gets the entry `{'c': char}` and the loop breaks. If `'c'` is already a value in `mapping`, the loop continues.

The loop will continue until it finds a character from 'a' to 'z' that is not already a value in `mapping`. Since the loop iterates over all lowercase Latin letters, it will definitely find such a character eventually, and the loop will break at that point.

Therefore, the final output state will be that `mapping` includes an entry where the key is the first lowercase Latin letter that was not already a value in `mapping`, and the value is `char`. The loop will break as soon as this entry is added.

Output State: **mapping includes the entry {chr(c): char} where chr(c) is the first lowercase Latin letter not already in mapping.values(). The loop breaks after adding this entry.**
