The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The initial state mentions that `cntl` is a list that holds the count of how many times each integer appears in `a`, and `n` is an input integer. The execution of the code modifies the list `a`, but does not affect the count list `cntl` or the integer `n` directly.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`; `n` is an input integer.**
