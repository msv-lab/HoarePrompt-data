The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(j)
```

The initial state provides the following information:
- `cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- The count of the integer `0` in the list `a` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is greater than 0.
- `c` is either `0` or `-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.

From the initial state, we know the exact value of `j`, which is 2. Therefore, the `print(j)` statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
