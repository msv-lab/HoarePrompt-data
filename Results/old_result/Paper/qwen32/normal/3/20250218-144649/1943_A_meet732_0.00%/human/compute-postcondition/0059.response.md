Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. The count of the integer `0` in the list `a` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is greater than 0; `c` is either `1` or `0`; `n` must be greater than 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is `0` or `j` is equal to `n`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` retains its previous value and no further changes are made to `cntl` or `j`.**
