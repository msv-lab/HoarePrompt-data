To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

The loop in question is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n` inclusive. The variable `j` is the loop control variable.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cntl` is a list where `cntl[i]` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is greater than 0.
- `c` is either `0` or `-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is `0` or `j` equals `n`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Since the loop variable `j` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the current iteration (where `j` was 2) has just finished. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which is `3`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be `3`.

The other variables (`cntl`, `c`, `n`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their states are not specified to change based on the loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is greater than 0, `c` is either `0` or `-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 3**.
