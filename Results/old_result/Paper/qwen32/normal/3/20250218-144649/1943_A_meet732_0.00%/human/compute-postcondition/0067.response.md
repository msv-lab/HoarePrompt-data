Output State: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is greater than 0, `c` is either `-1` or `-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 3.**

Natural Language: The value of `c` has been decremented by 1. If `c` was initially `0`, it is now `-1`. If `c` was initially `-1`, it is now `-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
