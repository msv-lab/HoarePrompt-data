Output State: **`cntl` is a list where each index `i` holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all the iterations, the `cntl` list will contain the frequency of each integer from the list `a` at the corresponding index. For example, if the integer `5` appears `3` times in `a`, then `cntl[5]` will be `3`. All other variables like `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
