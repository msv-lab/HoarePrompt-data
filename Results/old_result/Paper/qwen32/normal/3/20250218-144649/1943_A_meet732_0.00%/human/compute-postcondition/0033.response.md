Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or -1, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.**
