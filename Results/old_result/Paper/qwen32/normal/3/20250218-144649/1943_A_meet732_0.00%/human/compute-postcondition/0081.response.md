The code increments the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Given the initial state, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except at index `i` where it is `1`. After the operation, the value at index `i` will be `2`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is `2`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
