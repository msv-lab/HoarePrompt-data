To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to carefully examine the provided initial state and the given Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is at least 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `c` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we know that `j` is incremented by 1. However, we do not have information about the initial value of `j` before it was incremented. Therefore, we can only determine that `j` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since the initial value of `j` is not provided, we can only describe the value of `j` as "the initial value of `j` plus 1". 

### Conclusion:
The `print(j)` statement will output the value of `j` after it has been incremented by 1. Since we do not have the initial value of `j`, the most precise description we can provide is that `j` is incremented by 1 from its initial value.

Output: **j (where j is the initial value of j plus 1)**
