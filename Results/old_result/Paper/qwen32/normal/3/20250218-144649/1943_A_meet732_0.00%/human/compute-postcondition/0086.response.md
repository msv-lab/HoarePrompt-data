Let's analyze the given task step by step:

**Initial State:**
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is explicitly set to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print(0)
```

**Analysis:**
- The provided `print` statement is `print(0)`.
- This statement is independent of the variables `a`, `cntl`, and `n`.
- The value `0` is a literal integer and does not depend on any variable or calculation.

**Output:**
The `print(0)` statement will output the literal integer `0`.

Output: **0**
