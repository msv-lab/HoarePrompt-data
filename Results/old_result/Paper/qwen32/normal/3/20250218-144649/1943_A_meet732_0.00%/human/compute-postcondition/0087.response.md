Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `n` is an input integer. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, meaning that the integer `0` appears at least once in the list `a`.**
