Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `n` is an input integer, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`. `n` is at least 1, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is set to 1. If `c` is false or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`; `n` is at least 1; `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `cntl[j] < 2` or `not c` or `j == n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`; `n` is at least 1; `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is `j + 1`. If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is decremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `not c` or `j == n`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `c`, and the most internal loop or if statement continues if `cntl[j] >= 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
