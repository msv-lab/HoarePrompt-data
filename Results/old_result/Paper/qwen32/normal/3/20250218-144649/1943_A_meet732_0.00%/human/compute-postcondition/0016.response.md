Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**
