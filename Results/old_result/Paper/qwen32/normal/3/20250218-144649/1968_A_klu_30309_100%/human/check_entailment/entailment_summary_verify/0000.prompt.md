You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. It computes and returns a list `results` where each element `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y)` and `y` for each corresponding `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the loop where it breaks prematurely after finding the first `y` that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`. This means that it does not necessarily find the maximum possible sum for all test cases.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
    current_sum = gcd_val + y
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_y = y
        break  # This break statement causes the loop to exit prematurely
```

The `break` statement ensures that the loop stops after finding the first `y` that gives a higher sum than the current `max_sum`. This is incorrect because we need to check all possible values of `y` to ensure that we find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
    current_sum = gcd_val + y
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_y = y
# No break statement here
```

By removing the `break` statement, the loop will continue to check all possible values of `y` and ensure that the `best_y` found is indeed the one that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case.
