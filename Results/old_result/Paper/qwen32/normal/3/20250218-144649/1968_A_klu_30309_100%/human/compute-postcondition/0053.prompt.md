Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
    current_sum = gcd_val + y
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_y = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, and `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y_prev - 1` where `y_prev` is the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration and `y_prev - 1` > 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
