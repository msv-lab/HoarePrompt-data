Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is at least 2, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
