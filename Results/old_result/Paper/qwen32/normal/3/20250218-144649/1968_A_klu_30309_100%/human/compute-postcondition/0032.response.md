The code snippet provided calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. However, the variable `y` is not defined in the initial state. To accurately simulate the execution, we will assume `y` is a variable that has a specific value or is defined in the context of the program. Since `y` is not specified, we will leave it as `y` in our output state.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `gcd_val` is introduced and assigned the GCD of `x` and `y`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`**.
