Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2 and greater than `max_sum` before the update but now `max_sum` is also 2.**

In simple terms, `max_sum` has been updated to be equal to `current_sum`, which is 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
