The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `test_cases`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the list `test_cases` must have at least one element, as the loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`.

Given that `x` is a variable that will take the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration, we don't need to adjust `x` before the loop starts; it will be automatically assigned the first element of `test_cases` when the loop begins.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list**
