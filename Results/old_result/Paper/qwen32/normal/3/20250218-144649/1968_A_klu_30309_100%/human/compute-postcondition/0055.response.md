The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is iterated over the `test_cases` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in `test_cases`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements.
- `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended.
- `max_sum` is 0.
- `best_y` is 1.
- `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element being processed. For the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in the `test_cases` list.

Since the loop body is omitted, we do not know the exact changes made to `results`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` within the loop, but we can only adjust `x` based on the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

To be more specific, if `x` was the `i`-th element in `test_cases` during the last iteration, then in the next iteration, `x` should be the `(i+1)`-th element in `test_cases`.

Since we do not have the exact index of the last processed `x`, we can denote the next `x` as the subsequent element in `test_cases`. Assuming the previous `x` was `test_cases[i]`, the next `x` should be `test_cases[i+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

If we denote the previous `x` as `test_cases[i]`, then the next state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is `test_cases[i+1]`**.

Since we do not have the exact index `i`, we can generalize it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.

Therefore, the final adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**.
