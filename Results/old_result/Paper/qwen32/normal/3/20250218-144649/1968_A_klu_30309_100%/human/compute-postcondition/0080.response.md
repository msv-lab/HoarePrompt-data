To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates over each `x` in `test_cases` and, for each `x`, it iterates over `y` from `x-1` down to `1`. For each pair `(x, y)`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, and the sum of this GCD and `y`. If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`. The loop breaks as soon as a new `max_sum` is found.

Given the structure of the loop, after all iterations, `max_sum` will contain the maximum sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, and `best_y` will be the `y` that provided this maximum sum for the last `x` processed. The loop will have gone through all values of `x` in `test_cases`.

The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged by the loop's logic. The variable `x` will be the last element in `test_cases` after the loop completes. The variable `y` will be the value that provided the maximum sum for the last `x` processed. 

Let's summarize the final state:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `results` remains unchanged.
- `max_sum` will be the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y` found during the loop.
- `best_y` will be the `y` that provided this maximum sum for the last `x` processed.
- `x` will be the last element in `test_cases`.
- `y` will be the value that provided the maximum sum for the last `x` processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y` found during the loop, `best_y` is the `y` that provided this maximum sum for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last element in `test_cases`, and `y` is the value that provided the maximum sum for the last `x` processed.**
