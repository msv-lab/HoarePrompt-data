The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again for the next `x` in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the last element in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `test_cases`. Therefore, `x` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for the last `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` in `test_cases`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**
