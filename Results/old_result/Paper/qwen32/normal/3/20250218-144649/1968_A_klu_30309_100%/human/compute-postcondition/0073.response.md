The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. The loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` was decremented by 1. Therefore, we need to increment `y` by 1 to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `y` is initialized to `x - 1` and decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be one more than its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `best_y` is `x - 2` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, `y` is `y + 1`**
