You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) and \( y \) itself is maximized.

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. It then reads \( t \) integers, each representing an \( x \) for a test case.
3. For each \( x \), it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
4. The program then iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
5. For each \( y \), it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
6. It calculates the sum of the GCD and \( y \).
7. If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current \( y \).
8. The `break` statement after updating `best_y` and `max_sum` means that the loop will terminate early after finding the first \( y \) that maximizes the sum, which is not necessarily incorrect as the problem allows for any \( y \) that achieves the maximum sum.
9. It appends the `best_y` for each test case to the `results` list.
10. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic to find the maximum sum of GCD and \( y \) is correct, and the program will find at least one \( y \) that maximizes this sum for each test case. The use of `break` ensures that the program doesn't unnecessarily check smaller values of \( y \) once it finds the first optimal \( y \).

Given the problem statement's allowance for any \( y \) that achieves the maximum sum, the program's behavior is acceptable.
