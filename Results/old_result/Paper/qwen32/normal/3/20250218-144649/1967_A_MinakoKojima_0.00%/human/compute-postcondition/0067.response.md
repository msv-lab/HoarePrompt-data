Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is now `k - min(k, k // n - min(k, m + k // n - a0_prev))`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a0_prev)` and `a[1]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is set according to the conditions given, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a[1]` has been updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a[0]`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
