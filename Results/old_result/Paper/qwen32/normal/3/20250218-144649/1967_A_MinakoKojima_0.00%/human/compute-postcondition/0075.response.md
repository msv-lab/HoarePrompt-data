Given the code snippet and the initial state, we need to determine the new state after executing the line `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

Here's the breakdown of the variables involved:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99 (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `k` is now `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))` (unchanged)
- `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` (unchanged)
- `m` is the minimum value in the adjusted list `a` (unchanged)
- `ans` is `a[0]` (updated)
- `i` is `n-1` (unchanged)

The line `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `m` is the minimum value in the adjusted list `a`, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, `i` is `n-1`**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is now the product of its previous value (`a[0]`) and the difference between the last element (`a[n-1]`) and the second-to-last element (`a[n-2]`) of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
