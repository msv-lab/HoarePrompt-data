The code snippet `m = min(a)` assigns the variable `m` the minimum value from the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.**
