The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `a` and does not change within the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `a[i] - m`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is updated to `m` if `a[i]` was `m` else `2 * m - a[i]`, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to be more precise, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `i`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `i + 1`. So, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_old`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `i_old + 1`.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `a[i] - m`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is updated to `m` if `a[i]` was `m` else `2 * m - a[i]`, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

But to be more explicit about the transition:
If `i` was `i_old` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `a[i_old + 1] - m`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i_old + 1]` is updated to `m` if `a[i_old + 1]` was `m` else `2 * m - a[i_old + 1]`, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i_old + 1`**

Since we need to adhere strictly to the objects in the loop head, the final state considering only `i` and `n` is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
