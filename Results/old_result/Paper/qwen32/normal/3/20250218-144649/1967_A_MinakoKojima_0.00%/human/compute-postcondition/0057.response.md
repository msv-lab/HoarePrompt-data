The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `k` by reading a new input and splitting it into two integers. The initial state values of `t`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the new input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 0 and 99. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two integers obtained from the new input. The list `a`, the minimum value `m` in the list `a`, and the value of `ans` remain unchanged until further operations are performed.
