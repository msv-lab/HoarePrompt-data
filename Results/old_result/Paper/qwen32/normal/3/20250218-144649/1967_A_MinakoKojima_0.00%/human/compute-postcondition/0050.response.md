The code snippet multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `ans` is multiplied by `a[2] - a[1]`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2, and `ans` is initially multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`. After the execution of the code, the value of `ans` will be updated to its previous value multiplied by `a[2] - a[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]` and then further multiplied by `a[2] - a[1]`**.
