Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a0_prev) - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a0_prev)` and `a[1]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is set according to the conditions given, `i` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the minimum of `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]` from its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
