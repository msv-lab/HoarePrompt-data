In the given initial state, we have the following variables:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, but its exact value is not specified.
- `i` is explicitly set to 4.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

This statement prints the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly set to 4, it will print the number 4 twice.

Output: **4 4**
