To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it runs. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 3 and continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`. The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and prints the current value of `i` twice.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop runs if `n` is at least 3.
- After the loop runs, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

The loop will execute `n - 2` times since it starts at 3 and ends at `n + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `i` after all iterations will be `n + 1`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1`, and the value of `t` will remain the same as it was initially.
