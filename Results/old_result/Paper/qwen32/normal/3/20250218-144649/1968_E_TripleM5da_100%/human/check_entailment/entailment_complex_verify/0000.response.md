### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen points in an \(n \times n\) grid. The provided program outputs specific points for each test case, but it does not guarantee that these points will always maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment:

1. **Program Analysis:**
   - For each test case, with input \(n\):
     - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - For each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints the point \((i, i)\).

2. **Output for \(n = 3\):**
   - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\).
   - Distances: \(1, 4, 3\).
   - Set \(\mathcal{H}\): \(\{1, 3, 4\}\).

3. **Optimal Output for \(n = 3\):**
   - Points: \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\).
   - Distances: \(2, 1, 3\).
   - Set \(\mathcal{H}\): \(\{1, 2, 3\}\).

   Although both sets have the same size, the optimal configuration for larger \(n\) can be extended to cover more distances.

4. **Output for \(n = 4\):**
   - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\).
   - Distances: \(1, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1\).
   - Set \(\mathcal{H}\): \(\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

5. **Optimal Output for \(n = 4\):**
   - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), \((4, 4)\).
   - Distances: \(2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 1\).
   - Set \(\mathcal{H}\): \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

The optimal configuration for \(n = 4\) achieves a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances compared to the program's output.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always generate the optimal set of points to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
