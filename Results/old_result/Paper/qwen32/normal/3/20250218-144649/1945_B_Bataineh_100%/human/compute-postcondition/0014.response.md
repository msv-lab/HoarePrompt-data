Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers where `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18), `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18), and `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^18). Additionally, either `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `m` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `m` is less than `a` and `m` is greater than `b`, then the condition `m < a and m > b` holds; otherwise, it does not.**
