In the given initial state, the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined, but they are not used in the `print` statement. The variable `i` is also defined and set to 1, but it is also not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement will print the string `'PEAK'` as it is, without considering the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`.

Thus, the output is:

Output: **PEAK**
