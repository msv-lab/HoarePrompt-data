The given code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs the string `'STAIRS'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'STAIRS'`.

Output: **STAIRS**
