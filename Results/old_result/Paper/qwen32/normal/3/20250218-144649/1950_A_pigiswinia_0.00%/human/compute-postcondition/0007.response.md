The `print('PEAK')` statement will print the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as long as they satisfy the given conditions. The conditions provided are about the input values but do not affect the content of the string being printed.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

None of these conditions influence the string 'PEAK' that is being printed. The print statement outputs the string 'PEAK' directly.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **PEAK**
