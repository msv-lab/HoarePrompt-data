The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are initially unspecified integers within the range 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. The variable `i` is initially 1.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated to the integers provided in the input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `i` is 1.**
