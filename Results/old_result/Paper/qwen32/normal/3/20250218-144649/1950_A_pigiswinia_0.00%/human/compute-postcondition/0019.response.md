The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

State: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, and `i` is 2**
