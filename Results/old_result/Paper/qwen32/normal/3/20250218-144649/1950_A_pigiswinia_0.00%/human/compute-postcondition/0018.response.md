Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, and `i` is 1. If `a < b < c`, the condition is evaluated but no changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. Otherwise, the condition is evaluated but no changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. In all cases, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
