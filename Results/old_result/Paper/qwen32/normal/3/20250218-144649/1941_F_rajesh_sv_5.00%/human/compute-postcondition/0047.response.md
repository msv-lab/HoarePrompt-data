Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
