Output State: **D is a sorted list of unique values, left and right are elements from A, f is the next element in F, l and h are indices in D such that l == h, and ans is updated to be the minimum of its current value and max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f).**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The values of `D`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged.
