Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `testcases` is updated to hold the value returned by the function `func_3()`. The precondition that `testcases` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive remains valid.
