### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the problem statement.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_3()` reads an integer from the input. This is used to get the number of test cases.
   - `func_4()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers based on spaces. This is used to get the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, the list `A`, the list `D`, and the list `F`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F`.
   - `D` is sorted and duplicates are removed using `sorted(set(D))`.

3. **Finding Maximum and Second Maximum Differences:**
   - The program iterates through the list `A` to find the maximum difference (`max_diff`) and the second maximum difference (`next_max_diff`) between consecutive elements.
   - It also keeps track of the index where `max_diff` occurs.

4. **Calculating Minimum Possible Imbalance:**
   - The program initializes `ans` with `max_diff`.
   - For each value `f` in `F`, it tries to find the optimal position to insert a new problem with complexity `d + f` (where `d` is from `D`) to minimize the imbalance.
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the appropriate position in `D` for the new problem.
   - It then adjusts `ans` based on the new possible maximum difference after inserting the new problem.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff` for each test case.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Wrapper Function Issue:**
   - `func_1` defines a function `wrapper` but does not return it properly. It should return `wrapper` as follows:
     ```python
     def func_1(func):
         d = {}
         def wrapper(*args):
             if args not in d:
                 d[args] = func(*args)
             return d[args]
         return wrapper
     ```
   - However, this function is not used anywhere in the code, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Binary Search and Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the optimal position and adjusting `ans` seems correct based on the problem statement. The binary search helps efficiently find the position to minimize the imbalance.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest and largest possible values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements in `A`, `D`, and `F` as per the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the problem statement and handles the given constraints. The only issue is with the `func_1` function, but it is not used in the program. Therefore, the program is functionally correct.

**Correctness: True**
