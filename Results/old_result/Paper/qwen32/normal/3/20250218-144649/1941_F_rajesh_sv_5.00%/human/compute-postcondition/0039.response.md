The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the position where `right - f` would be inserted in `D` minus one, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**
