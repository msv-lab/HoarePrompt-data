Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` is the position where `left - f` would be inserted in `D`, `h` is `mid`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The condition `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum` holds true.**

In this output state, the variable `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
