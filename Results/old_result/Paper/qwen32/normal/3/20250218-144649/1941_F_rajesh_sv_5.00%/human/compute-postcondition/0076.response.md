The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `h` is at least `l + 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `l` is still less than `h`.

No other states need to be adjusted. The state of `D`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` do not affect the condition for the `while` loop to continue.

State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**
