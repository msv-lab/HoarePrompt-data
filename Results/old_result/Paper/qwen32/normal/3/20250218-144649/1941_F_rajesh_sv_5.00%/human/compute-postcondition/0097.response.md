The `while` loop in the given code continues to execute as long as `l` is less than `h`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l` remains less than `h`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `D` is a sorted list of unique values.
- `left - f` is less than an element in `D`.
- `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`.
- If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
- `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `l` is still less than `h` after the updates. The only variables we can adjust are `l` and `h`. Given the update rules, we need to ensure that the new value of `l` is still less than the new value of `h`.

If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. To ensure `l` is still less than `h`, we need to make sure that `mid + 1` is less than `h`.

If `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` is updated to `mid`. To ensure `l` is still less than `h`, we need to make sure that `l` is less than `mid`.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that the state should be adjusted such that `l` remains less than `h` after the updates. Since the exact values of `l` and `h` are not provided, we can ensure the loop can execute one more time by stating that `l` must be less than `h`.

State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
