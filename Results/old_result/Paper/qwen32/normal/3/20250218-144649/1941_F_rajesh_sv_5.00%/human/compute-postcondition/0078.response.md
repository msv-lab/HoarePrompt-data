The code snippet provided updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by recalculating them based on the current values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`. The other variables (`D`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `l`, `h`, `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.** 

This means `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` have been recalculated to be `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively, while all other variables retain their initial state.
