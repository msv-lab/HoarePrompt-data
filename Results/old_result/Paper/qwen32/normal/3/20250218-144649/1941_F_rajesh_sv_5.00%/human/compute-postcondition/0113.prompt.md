Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` equals `h`, representing the optimal position in `D` after the binary search converges. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: D is a sorted list of unique values, left and right are elements from A, f is the next element in F, l and h are indices in D such that l == h or l == h + 1. If l == h, ans is updated to be the minimum of its current value and max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f). Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` and `h` are equal, representing the final index in `D` that provides the best balance between `left - f` and `right - f`. If `l == h`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
