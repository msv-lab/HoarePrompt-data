The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust `k` for the next iteration. According to the loop statement, `k` iterates over the range from `0` to `n - j - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, but it must still be within the range `[0, n - j - 1]`.

Let's calculate the new value of `k`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `n - 2`.
- For the next iteration, `k` should be `k + 1`, which is `(n - 2) + 1 = n - 1`.

However, we need to ensure `k` is within the valid range `[0, n - j - 1]`. Given that `n` is at least 4 and `j` is 1, the range is `[0, n - 2]`.

Since `k` is now `n - 1` and the maximum valid value for `k` is `n - 2`, the loop cannot execute one more time because `k` would be out of the valid range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, if it were to occur, would be:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `k` is `n - 1`**

But since `k` is out of the valid range, the loop does not execute again. The final state remains as:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `k` is `n - 2`**
