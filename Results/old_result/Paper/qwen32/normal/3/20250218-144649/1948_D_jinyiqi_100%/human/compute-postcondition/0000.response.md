The code snippet converts the string `s` into a list of its characters. Therefore, the variable `s` which was initially a string is now a list of characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a list of characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark. The total length of all lists `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000.**
