The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop is iterating from `n // 2` down to 1, decrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is such that `n // 2` is at least 1 (otherwise, the loop would not have started). For the loop to execute again, `j` would need to be decremented by 1, but since `j` is currently 1, the loop will terminate after this iteration. Therefore, to execute one more time, `j` should be 2, and `n` must be such that `n // 2` is at least 2.

State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // 2` is at least 2**
