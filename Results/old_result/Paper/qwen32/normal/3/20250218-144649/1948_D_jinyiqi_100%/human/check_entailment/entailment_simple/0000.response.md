### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks in a string with lowercase Latin letters. However, the logic within `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly implement the required solution.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic for Tandem Repeat**: The program attempts to find the longest tandem repeat by iterating over possible lengths of the repeat (from `n // 2` down to `1`). For each possible length `j`, it checks if there is a substring of length `2 * j` where the first half matches the second half, considering question marks as wildcards. However, the method of incrementing `count` whenever a match is found (or a question mark is encountered) is incorrect. The `count` should be reset to zero if a mismatch is found, but the program does not correctly handle this. 

2. **Handling Question Marks**: The program correctly identifies that question marks can match any character, but it does not ensure that the characters on both halves of the substring match correctly when question marks are involved. The current logic simply increments `count` if there is a match or a question mark, but it does not handle the scenario where a question mark should be replaced with a character that matches the corresponding character on the other half of the substring.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints `0` if no valid tandem repeat is found, but due to the flawed logic, it might print an incorrect length for some test cases.

### Correctness:
Given the flaws in the logic, the program does not correctly determine the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
