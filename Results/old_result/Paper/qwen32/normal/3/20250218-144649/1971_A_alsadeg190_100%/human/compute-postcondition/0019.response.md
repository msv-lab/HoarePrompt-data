To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change over time.

The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the input integer. In each iteration, the loop reads a new pair of integers `(x, y)` from the input, and then prints the two integers in ascending order.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the output state after all iterations will be:

- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `x` after the loop completes all iterations because the loop runs `x` times.
- The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the input.

The loop does not modify `t` and does not retain the values of `x` and `y` from previous iterations; it only retains the values from the last iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the last pair of input, `y` is the second integer from the last pair of input, and `i` is equal to the original value of `x`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` stays the same, `i` equals the number of iterations (`x`), and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
