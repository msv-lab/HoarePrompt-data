The code snippet `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y` respectively. Given that the initial state specifies the ranges for `t`, `x`, and `y`, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input.

Since the input operation changes the values of `x` and `y`, the initial ranges for `x` and `y` are overwritten. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input.**
