You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two space-separated integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the last pair of input, `y` is the second integer from the last pair of input, and `i` is equal to the original value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9. It then prints the two integers in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to handle the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the requirements:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `x` times, where in each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
3. Inside the loop, the program checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
4. If `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to `y`), the program prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. This approach ensures that for each test case, the program outputs the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

The program correctly handles the input and output requirements for each test case. It reads the number of test cases, iterates through each test case, and prints the minimum and maximum values in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
