The loop iterates `x` times, and during each iteration, it reads two integers from the input, compares them, and prints them in ascending order. The variables `t` and `y` are not directly affected by the loop's iterations, except that `y` is reassigned with a new value in each iteration. The variable `x` is also reassigned with a new value in each iteration, and `i` is the loop counter that increments from 0 to `x-1`.

After all iterations are complete, `i` will have reached `x-1`, meaning the loop has executed `x` times. The values of `t` and `y` from the last iteration will be held, and `x` will be the value from the last input pair.

**Output State:** `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the last input pair, `y` is the second integer from the last input pair, and `i` is `x-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` remains unchanged, `x` and `y` hold the values from the last input pair, and the loop counter `i` will be equal to `x-1`, reflecting that the loop has completed all `x` iterations.
