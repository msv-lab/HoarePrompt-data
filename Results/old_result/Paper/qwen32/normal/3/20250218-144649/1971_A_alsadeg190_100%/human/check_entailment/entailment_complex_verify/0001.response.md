Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is designed to handle the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the requirements, using the annotated code to validate the steps:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly annotated as `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `x` times, where in each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. The annotation confirms that `x` and `y` are the integers from the last pair of input.
3. Inside the loop, the program checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. The annotation correctly reflects this behavior.
4. If `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to `y`), the program prints `y` followed by `x`. The annotation also correctly reflects this behavior.
5. This approach ensures that for each test case, the program outputs the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

The annotations provided validate each step of the program, confirming that the program correctly reads the number of test cases, iterates through each test case, and prints the minimum and maximum values in the required format. There are no discrepancies or errors in the original assessment.

Final: **True**
