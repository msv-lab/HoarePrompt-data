The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(x):`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x` after this increment.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next integer in the sequence, which is `i + 1` (from the previous state).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

To clarify, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. Since the problem states `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` simply as `i + 1`.

So the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to make it more explicit that `i` is incremented:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

Or more precisely if we denote the previous `i` value as `k`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since the problem doesn't specify the exact previous value of `i` other than it being incremented, the most accurate state representation is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`**. 

But to be clear about the iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
