Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
