To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new value of `z` after the given operation and keep the other variables unchanged.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input, where `x > k - 3`
- `z` is `k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)`
- `i` is 1

The code snippet is:
```
z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```

Let's calculate the new value of `z`:

1. The initial value of `z` is `k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)`.
2. The operation `z // (k - 1)` will be performed.
3. The result of `z // (k - 1)` is added to `z` along with `1`.

Let's denote the initial value of `z` as `z_initial`:
```
z_initial = k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)
```

The new value of `z` will be:
```
z_new = z_initial + z_initial // (k - 1) + 1
```

Since `z_initial` is `k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)`, we can substitute it back into the equation:
```
z_new = (k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) + (k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1
```

The value of `z` is updated to `z_new`. The other variables `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input, where `x > k - 3`; `z` is `k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + (k - 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1`; `i` is 1**
