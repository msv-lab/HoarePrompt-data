The code snippet splits the string `s` into three parts and converts each part into an integer, which are then assigned to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input.**
