Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s`. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition holds as stated. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then no specific change is made to `x` or `a` unless `a` is less than `x + 2`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated after `x - k + 3` iterations of the loop where `z` is updated as `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1` starting from `z = k - 2`. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
