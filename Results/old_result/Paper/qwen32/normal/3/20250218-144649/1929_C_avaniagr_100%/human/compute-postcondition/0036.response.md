The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) that are derived from input, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
