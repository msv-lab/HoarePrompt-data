Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each of the t test cases, k, x, and a are integers such that 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s`. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition holds as stated. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then no specific change is made to `x` or `a` unless `a` is less than `x + 2`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated after `x - k + 3` iterations of the loop where `z` is updated as `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1` starting from `z = k - 2`. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input. If `x < k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `x > k - 1`, `z` is calculated through the formula \( z_{i+1} = z_i + \left\lfloor \frac{z_i}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \) for `x - k + 1` iterations starting from `z = k - 1` if `k != 2`, or `z = 1` if `k = 2`. The condition `a >= z` holds if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `z`; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input. If `x < k - 1`, then if `x == k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 2` holds; otherwise, if `x != k - 1`, then `x > k - 3` and `z` is the value obtained by applying the loop's update rule `x - k + 3` times starting from `z = k - 2`; `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains as it is; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`. If `x < k - 1` does not hold, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` remains as it is; otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged in both cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
