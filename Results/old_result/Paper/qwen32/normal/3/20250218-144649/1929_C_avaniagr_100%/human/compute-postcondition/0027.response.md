To determine what will be printed when the `print('NO')` statement executes, we need to consider the initial state and the conditions provided. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting a string `s`.
   - `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`.
   - `z` is calculated through a loop that runs `x - k + 3` times, starting with `z = k - 2` and updating `z` in each iteration using the formula `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1`.
   - `a` is less than `z`.

2. **Loop Calculation for `z`**:
   - The loop runs `x - k + 3` times.
   - In each iteration, `z` is updated using the formula `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1`.
   - The initial value of `z` is `k - 2`.

3. **Condition on `a`**:
   - The condition `a < z` must be true.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Based on the given information, the print statement will execute and print the string `'NO'`. The conditions and calculations for `z` and the comparison with `a` do not affect the print statement itself, as it directly prints `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
