You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, trump is a character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}, and cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: - After all cards are processed, `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit.
    #   - `answers` will contain strings representing pairs of cards from non-trump suits, sorted by rank.
    #   - `suits` will have `None` for all suits that had at least one card processed (i.e., all suits that were part of pairs in `answers`).
    #
    #Given this understanding, the final output state can be described as:
    #
    #Output State:
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains all the formatted strings created during the loop's execution, and `suits` has `None` for all suits that had at least one card processed.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` is `[]`, `answers` contains all the formatted strings created during the loop's execution, and `suits` has `None` for all suits that had at least one card processed.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is `[]`, `answers` contains all the formatted strings created during the loop's execution, and `suits` has `None` for all suits that had at least one card processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns `None` in all cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing (None).

Case_2: The program returns nothing (None)

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
