Postcondition: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list. `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'. `suits` is a dictionary with at least two entries, e.g., `{'hearts': None, 'spades': 10}`. `suit` is 'spades' and `rank` is 10. Since `rank` is not `None`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.**
