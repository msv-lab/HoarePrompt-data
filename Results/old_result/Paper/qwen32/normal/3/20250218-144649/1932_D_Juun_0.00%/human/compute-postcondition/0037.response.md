Postcondition: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, `answers` will contain strings representing pairs of cards from non-trump suits, sorted by rank, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one entry, e.g., `{'hearts': None}`. If `rank` is `None`, the current value of `rank` remains `None`. Otherwise, the postcondition is the same as the precondition since there is no else part to modify the state.**
