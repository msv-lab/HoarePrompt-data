Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the last card in `cards` if the `suit` of the last card is equal to `trump`; otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is a list containing a new string formed from the sorted rank and the suit value, concatenated with the `suit` character if `suits[suit]` was not `None`. If `suits[suit]` was not `None`, it is now `None`; otherwise, it is now `rank`. `card` is `cards[-1]`; `rank` is the rank of the last card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the last card in `cards`.**
