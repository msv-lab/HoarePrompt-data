Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints an index `ans` which is the position in the string that is closest to the middle of the string, under the condition that the number of '0's on the left and the number of '1's on the right can each be at most half of their respective totals up to that point.**
