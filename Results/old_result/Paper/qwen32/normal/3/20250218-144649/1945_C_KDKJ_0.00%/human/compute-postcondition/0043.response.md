The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. In this context, the variables `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` are not explicitly modified by the `continue` statement, and the list `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` remains unchanged.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum`, these variables retain their values from the previous state. The loop will proceed to the next iteration, but the values of the variables will not be updated in this step.

Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[i][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`.**
