Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`. However, if the best position is indeed at `0`, the program will not update `ans` because the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` will always be true. To fix this, `ans` should be initialized to a value that cannot be a valid index, such as `-1`.

2. **Condition for Updating `ans`**: The current condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` only updates `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle or equally close. However, if there are multiple positions with the same distance to the middle, it should update `ans` to the smaller index. This condition is correct, but the initialization of `ans` as `0` can cause issues.

3. **Printing the Result**: The function `func_1` prints the result directly. However, when `func_2` calls `func_1` multiple times, it will print the results immediately after each test case. This is generally acceptable, but if the problem requires all results to be printed at once after processing all test cases, the approach needs to be adjusted.

To fix these issues, the initialization of `ans` should be changed, and results should be collected and printed at the end if necessary. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        (x, y) = S[-1]
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        S.append([x, y])
    ans = -1
    satisfy = 0
    for i in range(n):
        left = S[i][0]
        lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        rsum = n - lsum
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif ans == -1 or abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans) or (abs(n / 2 - i) == abs(n / 2 - ans) and i < ans):
            ans = i
    return ans

def func_2():
    results = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        results.append(func_1())
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_2()
```

This version of the program initializes `ans` to `-1` and collects all results before printing them, which is a safer approach if future requirements change.
