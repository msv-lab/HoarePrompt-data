The variable `left` is assigned the value of `S[i][0]`. The initial state of the input list `S` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `i` are also unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the variable `left` which holds the value of the first element of the `i`-th sublist in `S`.

Output State: **The input list `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i`; `left` is `S[i][0]`.**
