In this task, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, given the state at the end of the previous iteration. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not retain its value between iterations, the only state we need to consider is the state of the input, which determines the number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is "Input must be a positive integer," we infer that the loop is iterating based on the integer value obtained from the input. Let's denote this input value as `N`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration, meaning that `N` was decremented by 1 (conceptually, since the loop variable `_` is not used).

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The input value `N` must be decremented by 1, as one iteration has already completed.
- The input must still be a positive integer for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be that the input must be a positive integer that is one less than the input at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **Input must be a positive integer that is one less than the input at the end of the previous iteration**.
