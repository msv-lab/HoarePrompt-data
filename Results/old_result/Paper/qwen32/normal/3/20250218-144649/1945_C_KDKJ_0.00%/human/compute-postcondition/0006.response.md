To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the provided information:

1. The loop runs `int(input())` times.
2. The loop body calls `func_1()` in each iteration.
3. The output state after the first 3 iterations indicates that the input `n` is a positive integer and gets decremented by 1 in each iteration.

From the given information, we can infer that the loop will continue to run until the input integer `n` becomes 0. This means that after `n` iterations, the loop will terminate.

The output state after all iterations will be when `n` has been decremented to 0, and the loop has ended. Since the problem doesn't specify any changes to other variables or states outside the loop, we can assume that the only variable affected by the loop is the input `n`, which is decremented in each iteration.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations is when `n` equals 0.

Output State: **n is 0.**

In natural language: After all iterations have finished, the input integer `n` has been decremented to 0, and the loop has terminated.
