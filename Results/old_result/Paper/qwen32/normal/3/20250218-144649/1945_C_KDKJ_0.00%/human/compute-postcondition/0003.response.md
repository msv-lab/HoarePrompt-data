To provide an accurate output state, we need to know the implementation of the function `func_1()`. Without knowing the internal operations of `func_1()`, it is impossible to determine how the variables are affected. However, based on the initial state provided and the general understanding of what a function call may do, I can provide a generic answer.

Given that the initial state is "Input must be a positive integer that is one less than the input at the end of the previous iteration," we can assume that `func_1()` might modify this input in some way. Since the exact behavior of `func_1()` is unknown, let's assume it modifies the input as per the typical behavior of such functions, which could be incrementing the input by 1, for example.

So, if the input at the end of the previous iteration was `n`, the current input is `n-1`. After calling `func_1()`, let's assume it increments the input by 1, making it `n`.

Output State: **Input is a positive integer `n`**

This output state assumes that `func_1()` increments the input by 1, making it equal to the input at the end of the previous iteration. If `func_1()` performs a different operation, the output state would need to be adjusted accordingly.
