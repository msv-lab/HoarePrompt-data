The code snippet assigns the sum of the first and second elements of the `i`-th sublist in the list `S` to the variable `lsum`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, and the list `S`) remain unchanged.

Given that `S[i][0]` is `left`, `lsum` will be the sum of `left` and `S[i][1]`.

Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[i][1]`.**
