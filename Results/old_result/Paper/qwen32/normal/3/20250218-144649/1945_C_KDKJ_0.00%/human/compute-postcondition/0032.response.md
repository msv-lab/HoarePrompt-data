Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]; ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + count_1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + count_1)`. Additionally, either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and conditions.
