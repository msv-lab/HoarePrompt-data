The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still `i + 1` as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[i][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`; `ans` is `i`.**
