Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `s` is the next character in the string `a`. If `s` is '0', then `x` is '1'. Otherwise, `y` is increased by 1 and `x` remains the last character of `a`. `S` is a list that now includes the pair `[x, y]`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `a` is still a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The character `s` is still the next character in the string `a`. The value of `x` is '1' if `s` is '0'; otherwise, `y` is increased by 1, and `x` remains the last character of `a`. The list `S` now includes the pair `[x, y]`.
