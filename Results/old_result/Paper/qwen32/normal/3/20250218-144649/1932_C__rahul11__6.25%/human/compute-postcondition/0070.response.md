The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The initial value of `l` is 0, so after the increment, `l` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of n zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; the current character at index `k` in `s` is 'L'**.
