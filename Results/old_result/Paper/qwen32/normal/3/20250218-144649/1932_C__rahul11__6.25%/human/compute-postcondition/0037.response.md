Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`; `c` is 3; `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is not 'L' and `l` is 0, or `n - 3` if `s[k]` is not 'L' and `l` is 1; `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'; `k` is `k + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `c` has been incremented by 1, so its value is now 3. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
