Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are `0`. If `s[k] == 'L'`, then `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` and `l` is either 2 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` and `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. `c` is 2 in both cases, and `k` is `k + 1`.**
