The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. This means that the previous value of `arr` is replaced by the new list of integers read from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element from index 0 to `n-1` contains the value of `ans % m % MOD` after each iteration; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by the elements at positions `l` to `r` (exclusive) in `arr`, modulo `MOD`; `c` is `n`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`; `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`.**
