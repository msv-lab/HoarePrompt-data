Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first four elements are `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are `0`; `c` is 3; `k` is `k + 1`. If `s[k] == 'L'`, then `ans` is `(ans // arr[l-1]) % MOD` and `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` and `r` is `r - 1`.**
