You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Example

    3 1 4 2
    
    LRRL
    
    5 1

    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the product of an array of integers, divided by elements specified by a sequence of 'L' and 'R' characters, and returns these values modulo a given number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a critical flaw in the way it updates the product `ans` after removing an element from the array. Specifically, the code uses integer division (`//`) to remove the element from the product, which is not correct because integer division does not properly handle cases where the product is not evenly divisible by the element being removed.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 6
3 2 2 1
LLRR
```

Expected output:
```
2 0 0 0
```

Explanation of expected output:
- Initial product: \(3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 1 = 12\), remainder when divided by 6 is 0.
- Command 'L': Remove 3, new product is \(2 \times 2 \times 1 = 4\), remainder when divided by 6 is 4.
- Command 'L': Remove 2, new product is \(2 \times 1 = 2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 1, new product is \(2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 2, new product is \(1\), remainder when divided by 6 is 1.

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output because the integer division does not handle the product correctly when the product is not a multiple of the element being removed.

Let's see how the provided code handles this test case:
- Initial product: \(3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 1 = 12\), remainder when divided by 6 is 0.
- Command 'L': Remove 3, new product is \(12 // 3 = 4\), remainder when divided by 6 is 4.
- Command 'L': Remove 2, new product is \(4 // 2 = 2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 1, new product is \(2 // 1 = 2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 2, new product is \(2 // 2 = 1\), remainder when divided by 6 is 1.

The issue arises when the product is not a multiple of the element being removed. For example, if the product is 10 and the element is 3, `10 // 3` is 3, which is incorrect because the correct product after removing 3 should be `10 / 3` rounded down, which is not handled by integer division in this context.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
