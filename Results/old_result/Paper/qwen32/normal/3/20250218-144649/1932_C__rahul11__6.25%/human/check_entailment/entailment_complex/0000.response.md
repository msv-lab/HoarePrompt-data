### Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem as described, but there are some issues with the logic and the use of modulo operations that need to be addressed to ensure correctness.

1. **Modulo Operation Misuse**: The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6`, but the problem only requires results modulo `m`. The additional modulo `MOD` operation is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because it doesn't preserve the correct product modulo `m` when dividing elements out of the product.

2. **Division in Modulo Arithmetic**: The program uses integer division (`//`) to remove elements from the product, which is incorrect in the context of modulo arithmetic. Instead of dividing, the program should multiply by the modular inverse of the element being removed. This is because division in modular arithmetic is equivalent to multiplication by the modular inverse.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product of the array elements is calculated and then taken modulo `m`. However, the subsequent divisions should respect the modulo `m` to maintain correctness.

### Correctness:

Given the above points, the program does not correctly handle the modulo arithmetic and the removal of elements from the product, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
