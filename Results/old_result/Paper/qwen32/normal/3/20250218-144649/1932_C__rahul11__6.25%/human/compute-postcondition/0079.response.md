Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the `c`-th element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `k` is 2; `ans` is updated to `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`.**

Natural Language: The value of the `c`-th element in the list `res` is now updated to `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
