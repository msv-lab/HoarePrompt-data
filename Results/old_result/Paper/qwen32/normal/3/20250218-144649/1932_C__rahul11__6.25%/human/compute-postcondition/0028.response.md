The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of the variable `c` by 1. 

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string
- `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`
- `ans` is either `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', or `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is not 'L'
- `c` is 1
- `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`
- `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'

After executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is either `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', or `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is not 'L'; `c` is 2; `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`; and `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'.**
