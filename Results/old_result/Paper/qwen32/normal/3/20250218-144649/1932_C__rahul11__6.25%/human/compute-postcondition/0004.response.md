The code snippet `s = list(input())` reads a string from the input and converts it into a list of characters. This affects the variable `s` by assigning it the new value, which is a list of characters from the input string. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**
