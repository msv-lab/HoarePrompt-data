The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` with the value 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is 1.**
