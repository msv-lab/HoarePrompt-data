The code snippet provided is `ans *= i`. This means that the variable `ans` is updated by multiplying its current value with the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided, so we cannot determine a specific new value for `ans`. Given the precondition, the only variable that changes is `ans`, and it becomes `ans * i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `ans * i`; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.**
