Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a critical flaw in the way it updates the product `ans` after removing an element from the array. Specifically, the code uses integer division (`//`) to remove the element from the product, which is not correct because integer division does not properly handle cases where the product is not evenly divisible by the element being removed.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 6
3 2 2 1
LLRR
```

Expected output:
```
2 0 0 0
```

Explanation of expected output:
- Initial product: \(3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 1 = 12\), remainder when divided by 6 is 0.
- Command 'L': Remove 3, new product is \(2 \times 2 \times 1 = 4\), remainder when divided by 6 is 4.
- Command 'L': Remove 2, new product is \(2 \times 1 = 2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 1, new product is \(2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 2, new product is \(1\), remainder when divided by 6 is 1.

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output because the integer division does not handle the product correctly when the product is not a multiple of the element being removed.

Let's see how the provided code handles this test case:
- Initial product: \(3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 1 = 12\), remainder when divided by 6 is 0.
- Command 'L': Remove 3, new product is \(12 // 3 = 4\), remainder when divided by 6 is 4.
- Command 'L': Remove 2, new product is \(4 // 2 = 2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 1, new product is \(2 // 1 = 2\), remainder when divided by 6 is 2.
- Command 'R': Remove 2, new product is \(2 // 2 = 1\), remainder when divided by 6 is 1.

The issue arises when the product is not a multiple of the element being removed. For example, if the product is 10 and the element is 3, `10 // 3` is 3, which is incorrect because the correct product after removing 3 should be `10 / 3` rounded down, which is not handled by integer division in this context.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
