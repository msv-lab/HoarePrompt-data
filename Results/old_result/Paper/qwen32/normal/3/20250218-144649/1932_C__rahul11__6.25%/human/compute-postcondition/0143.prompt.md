Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are `0`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are `0`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 2; `l` is either 1 or 0; `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is divided by `arr[l]` and `l` is incremented to 1. If `s[k]` is not 'L', `ans` is divided by `arr[r]` and `r` is decremented to `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are `0`. If `s[k] == 'L'`, then `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` and `l` is either 2 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD` and `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. `c` is 3; `k` is `k + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first four elements are `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are `0`; `c` is 4; `k` is `k + 1`. If `s[k] == 'L'`, then `ans` is `(ans // arr[l-1]) % MOD` and `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` and `r` is `r - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
