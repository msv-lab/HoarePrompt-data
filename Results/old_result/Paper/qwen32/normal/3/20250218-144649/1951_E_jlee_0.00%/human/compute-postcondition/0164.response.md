The `continue` statement simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Given the provided initial state and the `continue` statement, no changes are made to any of the variables listed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1; `count` is the first index where `s[j] != x` if any such index exists before the loop completes, otherwise 0; `count2` is the number of consecutive characters equal to `x` after the first differing character if any such character exists, otherwise 0; `done` is False; `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
