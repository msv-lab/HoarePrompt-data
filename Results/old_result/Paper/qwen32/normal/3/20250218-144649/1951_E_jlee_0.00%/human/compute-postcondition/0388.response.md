Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `done` remains unchanged, and the state of `count` and `count2` remains unchanged.**
