Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, and `count2` remains unchanged unless `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, in which case `count2` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count` remains unchanged and `done` remains unchanged, with `count2` set to 0. If `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.**
