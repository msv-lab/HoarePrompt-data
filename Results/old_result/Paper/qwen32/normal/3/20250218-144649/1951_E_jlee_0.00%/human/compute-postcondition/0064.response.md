Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string with at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 0; if `count` is greater than 1, then `count2` is equal to `count` and `done` is True; if `count` is 1, then `count2` is 0. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**
