Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `x` is `s[0]`. If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is equal to 1 or `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, or if `n` is odd and the character at the midpoint of the string is not equal to `x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.**
