Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 2, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is 0 if `count` was not greater than 1, and `done` is True if `count` was greater than 1.**
