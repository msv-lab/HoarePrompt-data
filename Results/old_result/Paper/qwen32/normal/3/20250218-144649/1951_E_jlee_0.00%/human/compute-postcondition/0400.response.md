Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.**
