Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 0, `count2` is unchanged, and `done` is unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remains unchanged.**
