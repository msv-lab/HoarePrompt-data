Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `string` is the input string.
2. `n` is at least 1.
3. `j` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
4. `count2` is equal to `count`.
5. `i` is incremented by 1.
6. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
7. `x` is `s[0]` (the first character of the string).
8. `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
9. `done` is set to `True`.
10. `count` is greater than 1.
11. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
