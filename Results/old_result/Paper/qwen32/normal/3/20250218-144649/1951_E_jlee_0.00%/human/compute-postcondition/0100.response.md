Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 1, `count` is either 0 or 1 based on the conditions, `count2` is 0 unless `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` equals `x`, in which case `count2` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
