Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 1, `count` is unchanged, `count2` is unchanged, `done` is True**.

The code sets `done` to `True`, and this is the only change in the state. All other variables remain unchanged.
