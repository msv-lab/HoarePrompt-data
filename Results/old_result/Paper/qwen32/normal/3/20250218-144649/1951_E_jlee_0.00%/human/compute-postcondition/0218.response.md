Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 0; `done` is True if the first character of `s` at index `j` is not equal to the last character of `s` at index `n - 1 - j`; otherwise, `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, the behavior depends on `count2`: if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `count2` remains equal to `count`; if `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0; if `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `done` becomes True; if `count2` is not equal to `count`, `count2` is either less than or equal to `count` or greater than `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1.**
