You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths. It then calculates and prints the total number of sets of four sticks that can be formed from each test case, where all sticks in a set have the same length.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from a given set of sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon.

### Key Points
1. **Regular Polygons**: Regular polygons have all sides of the same length. The smallest regular polygon is a triangle (3 sides), but the problem does not specify a minimum number of sides, so we'll consider the smallest possible regular polygon, which is a square (4 sides), as the minimum practical polygon to form with sticks.
2. **Stick Usage**: Each stick can be used in exactly one polygon.
3. **Counting Sticks**: To form a square (the smallest regular polygon), we need 4 sticks of the same length. Therefore, for a given stick length, the maximum number of squares that can be formed is the integer division of the count of sticks of that length by 4.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths.
3. It counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `cnt`.
4. For each unique stick length, it calculates how many squares can be formed by performing integer division of the count by 4 (`x // 4`).
5. It sums these values to get the total number of squares that can be formed.
6. It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of squares (regular polygons with the minimum number of sides) that can be formed from the given sticks. The logic is sound as it counts the occurrences of each stick length and determines how many complete squares can be formed from these counts.

### Final Answer
Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
