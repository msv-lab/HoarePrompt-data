You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks available, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) and `n` must equal the length of `a`, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that length appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: ans is the sum of integer divisions of each unique stick length count by 4, t, n, a, and cnt remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of integer divisions of each unique stick length count by 4)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program only considers forming squares (4-sided polygons) from the sticks, as it divides the count of each stick length by 4. However, the problem description allows for forming any regular polygon, not just squares. For example, it should also consider forming triangles (3-sided polygons), pentagons (5-sided polygons), hexagons (6-sided polygons), etc.

Here's a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2

Output according to the program:
1

Expected Output:
2
```
In this case, the program can form only one square using 4 sticks of length 2. However, it can actually form two triangles using all 6 sticks. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
