The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input, which represent the lengths of the sticks. The variable `a` is assigned this list. The value of `n` (the number of sticks) is already given in the initial state and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks.**
