### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Data Structure Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of residents.
   - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]`. This list will store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house.

2. **Cumulative Counts Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the string `a`. For each character, it updates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - If the character is '0', it increments the count of '0's. If it's '1', it increments the count of '1's.
   - The cumulative counts are stored in the list `S`.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `-1`, which will store the optimal position of the road.
   - It then iterates over all possible positions `i` where the road could be placed (from `0` to `n`).
   - For each position `i`:
     - It calculates the number of residents on the left side (`left`) and the total number of residents on the left side (`lsum`).
     - It calculates the number of residents on the right side (`right`) and the total number of residents on the right side (`rsum`).
     - It checks if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side of the street.
       - This is done by checking if `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.
     - If the conditions are met, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found optimal position.
       - This is done by comparing `abs(n / 2 - i)` with `abs(n / 2 - ans)`.
     - If the current position is closer, it updates `ans` to `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - After checking all possible positions, the program prints the optimal position `ans` for the current test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given problem description. It handles all edge cases and constraints effectively.

**Correctness: True**
