To solve this, we need to understand the context and the function `func_1()`. Since the exact definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only infer the output state based on the given initial state and the execution of `func_1()`.

Given:
- The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 (one less than the previous input).
- `func_1()` has been executed.

Since `func_1()` has already been executed, calling `func_1()` again will not change its internal state unless it modifies global variables or has side effects. However, without knowing the specifics of `func_1()`, we can only assume that it does not change the precondition that the input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 (one less than the previous input).

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the precondition.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 (one less than the previous input) and `func_1()` has been executed.**
