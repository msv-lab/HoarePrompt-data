The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again. Therefore, `i` should be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration. The variable `n` remains the same.

State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 2`; `left` is `S[i + 1][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 2`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i + 1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the conditions are met without any further action on `ans`. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - (i + 1))` is less than `abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1`.**
