Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the conditions are met without any further action on `ans`. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i)` is less than `abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.**
