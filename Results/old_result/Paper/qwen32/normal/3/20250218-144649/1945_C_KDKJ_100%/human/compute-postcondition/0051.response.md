The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, none of the variables `S`, `n`, `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, or `rsum` are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 2`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**
