To solve this task, we need to understand the impact of executing `func_1()` again. However, the code snippet provided does not give us any information about the definition or behavior of `func_1()`. Therefore, we can only assume that executing `func_1()` has some effect, but we do not know what it is based on the given information.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, we can only state that `func_1()` has been executed again, and the precondition that the input to `int(input())` must be `x - 1` where `x` is the previous input and `x > 1` remains valid. No other variables or their values have been specified to be affected by `func_1()`.

Thus, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with the addition that `func_1()` has been executed again.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be `x - 1` where `x` is the previous input and `x > 1`, `func_1()` has been executed twice.**
