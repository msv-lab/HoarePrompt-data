The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables or alter the state of the program in any way, except for skipping the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, none of the variables (`S`, `ans`, `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) are modified. The conditions provided in the initial state remain valid.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `ans` is `-1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. Additionally, either `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`.**
