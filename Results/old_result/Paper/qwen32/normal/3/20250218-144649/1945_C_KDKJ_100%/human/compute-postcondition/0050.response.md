The code snippet provided updates the value of `rsum`. Initially, `rsum` is defined as `n - (i + 1)`. After executing the line `rsum = n - i`, the value of `rsum` changes to `n - i`.

Here are the variables and their states after the execution of the provided code:
- `S` remains `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` remains `i + 2`.
- `left` remains `S[i][0]`.
- `lsum` remains `i`.
- `right` remains `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.
- `rsum` is now `n - i`.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 2`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**
