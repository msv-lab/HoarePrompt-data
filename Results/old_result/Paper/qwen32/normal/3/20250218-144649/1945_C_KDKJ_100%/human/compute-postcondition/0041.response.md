The code snippet assigns the value of `n - i` to the variable `rsum`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**
