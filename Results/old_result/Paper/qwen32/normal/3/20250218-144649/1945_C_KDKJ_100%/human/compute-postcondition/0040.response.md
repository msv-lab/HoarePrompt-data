The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `right`. This new value is calculated as the difference between the second element of the last list in `S` and the second element of the `i`-th list in `S`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `right` is now `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.**
