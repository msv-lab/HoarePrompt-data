The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop's execution depends on the value provided to `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, the number of remaining iterations should be one less than the value provided to `int(input())` in the previous iteration.

Given that the input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 and `func_1()` has been executed, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is still an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Let's denote the input to `int(input())` as `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was some integer greater than 0, and now it should be `x - 1` for the loop to execute one more time. Since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can only say that it must be an integer greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 and `func_1()` has been executed.** 

However, to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to indicate that the input should now be one less than the previous input, which must still be greater than 0.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 (one less than the previous input) and `func_1()` has been executed.**
