Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]; ans` is `-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = i
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - i
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, then `ans` remains `-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the previous value of `ans` (which was `-1`). If neither condition is met, `ans` remains `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the conditions are met without any further action on `ans`. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i)` is less than `abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 2`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then no further changes are made. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i)` is less than `abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
