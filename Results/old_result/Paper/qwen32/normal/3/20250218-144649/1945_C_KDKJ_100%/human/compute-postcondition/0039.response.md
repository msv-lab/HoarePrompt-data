`lsum` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, so `lsum` becomes `i + 1`. Other variables, including `S`, `n`, and `left`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`.**
