Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer provided by the user input, `a` is a string provided by the user input that must have at least two characters, `s` is the second character of the string `a`, and `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x+1, y]]` if `s` is '0'. Otherwise, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y+1]]`. In both cases, `x` and `y` are the values from the last sublist of `S` before the increment.**
