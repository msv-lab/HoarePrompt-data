The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it only affects the control flow of the loop.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement will not modify any of the variables `S`, `n`, `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, or `rsum`. The values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**
