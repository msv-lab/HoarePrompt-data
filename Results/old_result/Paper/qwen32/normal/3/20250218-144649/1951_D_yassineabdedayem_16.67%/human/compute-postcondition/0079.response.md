The code snippet provided increments the variable `rep` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `rep` is initially 1. After the execution of `rep += 1`, the value of `rep` becomes 2.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is `n - Min * Max`; `k` is an integer greater than 0 and updated to `k - Min` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `k` is an integer less than or equal to 0; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `number` is `Min`.**
