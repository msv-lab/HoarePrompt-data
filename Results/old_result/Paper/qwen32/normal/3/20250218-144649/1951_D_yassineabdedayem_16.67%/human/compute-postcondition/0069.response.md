Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is `n - Min * Max`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Natural language: The variable `rep` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max`) retain their initial values.
