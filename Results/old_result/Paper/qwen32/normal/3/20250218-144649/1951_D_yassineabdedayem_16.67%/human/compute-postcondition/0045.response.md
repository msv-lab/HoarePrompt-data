The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tab` list. If `tab` has more than one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`, which means it has only one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least two elements.

Let's assume that `tab` originally contained either `['2']` or `['5']`. To proceed with the next iteration, `tab` needs to be adjusted to contain at least two elements.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 1, `number` is either 2 or 5, `tab` is either ['2', '5'] or ['5', '2'], `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5**

Note: The specific second element in `tab` can be either '2' or '5', as long as it is different from the first element to ensure `tab` has more than one element.
