Given the initial state, we know that the variable `i` can be either `'5'` or `'2'`. The `print` statement is set to output the value of `i` followed by a space, as specified by `end=' '`.

Since there is no additional logic or transformation applied to `i` before printing, the output will simply be the value of `i` with a trailing space.

Therefore, the output will be either `'5 '` or `'2 '` depending on the specific value assigned to `i`.

Output: **i (where i is either '5' or '2')**
