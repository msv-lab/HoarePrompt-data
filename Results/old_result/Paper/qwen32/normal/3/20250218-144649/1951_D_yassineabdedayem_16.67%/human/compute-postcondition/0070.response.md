To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```python
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here are the variables involved in the loop condition and their current states:
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`
- `k` is an integer greater than 0
- `rep` is 1
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not part of the loop condition, it is mentioned in the state)
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` (though `number` and `tab` are not part of the loop condition, they are mentioned in the state)
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`

For the loop to execute one more time, all conditions must be met:
1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

Let's analyze each condition:
1. `n != 0`: Since `n` is `n - Min * Max`, we need to ensure that after this operation, `n` is not zero. This means `n` must be greater than `Min * Max` before the operation.
2. `k > 0`: This condition is already satisfied as `k` is an integer greater than 0.
3. `rep < 60`: This condition is also satisfied as `rep` is 1.
4. `n >= k`: This condition ensures that `n` is at least as large as `k`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that after `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, it remains greater than or equal to `k` and not zero. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k` before the operation.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than `Min * Max + k`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`**
