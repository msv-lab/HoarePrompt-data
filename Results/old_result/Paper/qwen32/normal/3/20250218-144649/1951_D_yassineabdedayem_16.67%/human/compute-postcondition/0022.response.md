The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `Max` from it. Given that `k` is initially 3 and `Max` is 3, `k` becomes 0. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 3; `k` is 0; `rep` is 1; `number` is 1; `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 3**.
