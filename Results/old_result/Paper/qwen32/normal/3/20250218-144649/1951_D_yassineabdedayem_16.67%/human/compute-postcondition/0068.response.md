Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`
- `k` is an integer greater than 0 (decreased by `Min` if `number` was `Max`)
- `rep` is 0
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`
- If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is decreased by `Min`

Code Snippet:
```
n -= Min * Max
```

Impact:
- The value of `n` is decreased by the product of `Min` and `Max`.

Output State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `n` is now `n - Min * Max`
- `k` is an integer greater than 0 (unchanged, unless `number` was `Max` in the initial state, in which case it has already been decreased by `Min`)
- `rep` is 0 (unchanged)
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` (unchanged)
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` (unchanged in this step, but might change in future steps based on the new value of `n`)
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` (unchanged in this step, but might change in future steps based on the new value of `n`)
- `number` is either `Min` or `Max` (unchanged in this step, but might change in future steps based on the new value of `n`)

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is `n - Min * Max`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 0; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**
