The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the current values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0)
- `n` is `n + Min * Max`
- `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`)
- `rep` is 1
- `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`
- `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`

The new values of `Min` and `Max` will be recalculated as:
- `Min` becomes `min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` becomes `max(int(n / k), k)`

Since the expressions for `Min` and `Max` are recalculated and may change, the output state will reflect these new values while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is `n + Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`); `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**
