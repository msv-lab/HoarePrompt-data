Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 1.
   - `number` is either 2 or 5.
   - `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`.
   - `Min` is 2.
   - `Max` is 5.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(len(tab))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `tab` is a list that can either be `['2']` or `['5']`.
   - The `len()` function returns the number of items in an object.
   - Since `tab` is a list with one element, `len(tab)` will always be 1, regardless of whether `tab` is `['2']` or `['5']`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the length of the list `tab`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
