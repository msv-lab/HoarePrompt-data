Given the initial state and the code, we need to determine the new state after the code execution.

Initial State: 
- `t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`
- `rep` is 0
- `tab` is an empty list
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`
- `number` is `Min`
- `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`

The code to execute:
```
k = k - Max
```

Since `Max` equals `k`, the expression `k - Max` simplifies to `k - k`, which is `0`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `0`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a positive integer; `k` is 0; `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is `Min`**

Note that `Min` and `Max` depend on the new value of `k`, which is `0`. However, since `k` is now `0`, the expressions `min(n // k, k)` and `max(n // k, k)` are undefined due to division by zero. In practice, this would raise an error, but based on the given task format, we will keep the expressions as they are.
