Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 0; `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `tab` is `[]`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `k` is decreased by `Min`; either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been decreased by the value of `Min`. All other variables retain their initial conditions and constraints.
