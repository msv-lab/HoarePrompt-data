Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the original value of `n` before the addition of `Min * Max`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`); `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two elements `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

Natural Language: The value of `rep` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their original values and conditions as described in the initial state.
