The provided code snippet only reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases that will follow, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are not read or processed by this snippet. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `t`, which is assigned the value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input, representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.**
