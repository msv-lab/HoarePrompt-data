To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior and the given conditions of the loop.

The loop iterates over the elements of the list `tab` and prints each element followed by a space. The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in the list `tab`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `tab` could be `['2']` or `['5']`
- After 2 iterations: `tab` could be `['2', '5']` or `['5', '2']`
- After 3 iterations: `tab` could be `['2', '5']` or `['5', '2']`

From these states, we can infer that `tab` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute 3 times. Since the output states after 2 and 3 iterations suggest `tab` being `['2', '5']` or `['5', '2']`, and the loop needs to execute 3 times, it implies that `tab` must have exactly 3 elements.

Given the initial conditions and the information from the output states, `tab` must be `['2', '5', '2']` or `['2', '5', '5']` or `['5', '2', '2']` or `['5', '2', '5']` or `['5', '5', '2']` or `['2', '2', '5']`. However, since the loop has executed exactly 3 times, we can assume `tab` has exactly 3 elements, and the loop will print all of them.

Thus, the final output of the loop will be the concatenation of all elements in `tab`, each followed by a space. This means the final output will be `2 5 2 ` or `2 5 5 ` or `5 2 2 ` or `5 2 5 ` or `5 5 2 ` or `2 2 5 ` depending on the exact contents of `tab`.

Since the exact contents of `tab` are not specified beyond it having 3 elements, we can generalize the final output state as the loop printing all elements of `tab` followed by a space.

Given the problem constraints, the most likely and consistent scenario, considering the provided states, is that `tab` is `['2', '5', '2']`.

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **2 5 2 **

This means the loop prints `2 5 2 ` after all iterations are complete.
