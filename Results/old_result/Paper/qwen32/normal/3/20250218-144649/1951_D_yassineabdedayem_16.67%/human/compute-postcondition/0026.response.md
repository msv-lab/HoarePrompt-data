The code appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. Given that `number` is either 1 or 3, `tab` will have either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']` depending on the value of `number`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 3; `rep` is 1; `number` is either 1 or 3; `tab` is either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 3. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 2 and `number` is 3.**
