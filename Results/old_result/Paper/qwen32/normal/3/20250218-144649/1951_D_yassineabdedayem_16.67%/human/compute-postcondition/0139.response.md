The code snippet appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `number` is defined as `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, and `tab` initially contains two elements `str(number)`, after the execution of `tab.append(str(number))`, `tab` will have three elements, with the third element being `str(number)`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the original value of `n` before the addition of `Min * Max` and `n >= k`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`); `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing three elements `str(number)`, `str(number)`, `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**
