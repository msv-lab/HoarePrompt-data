In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

The state before the for loop includes `t`, which is the integer value representing the number of test cases. Since the loop variable `_` is not something we can adjust (it is just a placeholder), the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `t` is 1 or more.
