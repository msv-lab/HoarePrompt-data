Let's calculate the output state step by step:

1. Given `n` is 10 and `k` is 5.
2. `Min` is calculated as `min(n // k, k)`. Here, `n // k` is `10 // 5` which equals `2`. So, `Min` is `min(2, 5)` which equals `2`.
3. `Max` is calculated as `max(int(n / k), k)`. Here, `int(n / k)` is `int(10 / 5)` which equals `2`. So, `Max` is `max(2, 5)` which equals `5`.

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 10; `k` is 5; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5.**
