The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. Given that `Min` is 1 and `Max` is 3, `Min * Max` equals 3. Therefore, `n` will be reduced by 3.

Given the initial state, `n` is 3. After the operation `n -= Min * Max`, `n` becomes `3 - 3`, which is 0.

Other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet. The conditions for `k` and `number` are not affected by this operation, so they retain their initial values based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 0; `rep` is 1; `number` is either 1 or 3; `tab` is either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 3. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 2 and `number` is 3.**
