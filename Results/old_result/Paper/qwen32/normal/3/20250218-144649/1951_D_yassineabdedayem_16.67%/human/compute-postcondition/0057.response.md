The code snippet `tab = []` changes the value of `tab` from either `['2']` or `['5']` to an empty list `[]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is `[]`; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5. If `k` is 0, the sequence 2 5 2 is executed. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.**
