The provided initial state describes several variables and conditions within a program, but the `print` statement itself does not reference any of these variables. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, or `number`.

Output: **NO**
