Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the original value of `n` before the addition of `Min * Max` and `n >= k`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`); `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two elements `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided recalculates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the current values of `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged. The new values of `Min` and `Max` are calculated as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively.
