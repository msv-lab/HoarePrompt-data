Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t-1`, but since there's no initial value for `t` provided, this definition alone does not give us a specific value for `t`. However, it doesn't affect the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is defined as the string `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times. This means `s` will be a string consisting of the pattern `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

The print statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
