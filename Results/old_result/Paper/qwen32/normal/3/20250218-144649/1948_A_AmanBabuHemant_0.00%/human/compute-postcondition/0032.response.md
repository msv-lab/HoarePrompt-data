To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is the number of iterations to perform, where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` is an integer input for each iteration, where \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration, the value of `t` is decremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` is read as input.
   - If `n` is odd, the program prints "NO".
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring `'110'` \(n // 2\) times.
     - If the length of `s` is less than 200, the program prints "YES" followed by the string `s`.
     - Otherwise, the program prints "NO".

3. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration.
   - After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.

### Final Output State:
- After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.
- The values of `n` and `s` will depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration, but they will not persist after the loop completes because they are re-initialized in each iteration.
- The program will have printed "YES" or "NO" for each input `n` based on the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that retains a meaningful value after all iterations is `t`, which will be 0.
- The values of `n` and `s` are not relevant after the loop completes because they are local to each iteration.

**Output State: **t is 0.** The program will have printed "YES" or "NO" for each input `n` based on whether `n` is even and the length of the constructed string `s`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the value of `t` will be 0, and the program will have printed the appropriate responses for each input `n`.
