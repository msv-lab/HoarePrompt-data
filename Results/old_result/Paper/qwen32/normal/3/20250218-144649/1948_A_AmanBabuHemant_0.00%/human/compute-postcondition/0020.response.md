Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 49.
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('NO')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.
- The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the print statement, so there is no need to compute or derive its value based on the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
