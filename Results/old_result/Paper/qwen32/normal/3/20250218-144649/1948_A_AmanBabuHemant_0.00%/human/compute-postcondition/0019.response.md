Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 49.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Key Points:
1. The value of `t` does not influence the value of `s` or the print statement directly.
2. The string `s` is constructed by repeating the substring `'110'` a number of times equal to `n // 2`.

### Determining the Value of `s`:
- To determine the exact string `s`, we need to know the value of `n`.
- `s` is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The `//` operator denotes integer division, which discards the remainder.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider a few example values for `n` to see how `s` is constructed:

- If `n = 2`, then `n // 2 = 1`, so `s = '110'`.
- If `n = 4`, then `n // 2 = 2`, so `s = '110110'`.
- If `n = 5`, then `n // 2 = 2`, so `s = '110110'`.
- If `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`, so `s = '110110110'`.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of `s` depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe `s` in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `s`, which is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'110' repeated (n // 2) times (where n is the input integer)**
