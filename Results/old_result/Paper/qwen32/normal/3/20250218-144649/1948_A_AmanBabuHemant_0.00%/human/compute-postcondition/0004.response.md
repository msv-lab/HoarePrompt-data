The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
2. The variable `n` is an input integer and is odd.
3. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('NO')`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the values of `t` and `n` do not influence the output.

Output: **NO**
