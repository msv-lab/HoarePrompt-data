You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and determines if a specific string of length `n` can be constructed. If `n` is even and the resulting string length does not exceed 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a string with the specified number of special characters as per the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. The program uses the string '110' for constructing the output, which contains digits instead of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement.
2. The program checks if `n` is even and only then generates a string, but it doesn't handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the program should print 'NO'.
3. The string '110' * (n // 2) will not necessarily have exactly `n` special characters. For example, if `n` is 6, the string '110110' will have 4 special characters, not 6.

Let's consider a specific example:
- Input: `n = 1`
- Expected Output: `NO` (since it's not possible to have exactly 1 special character with the given rules)
- Actual Output: `NO` (which is correct in this case, but the program doesn't handle it correctly for other cases)

Another example:
- Input: `n = 6`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by a string like `AAABAACC` which has exactly 6 special characters.
- Actual Output: `YES` followed by `110110` which has only 4 special characters.

To fix the program, we need to generate a string using uppercase Latin letters and ensure that it has exactly `n` special characters. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version uses the string 'AB' to ensure that the output string is made up of uppercase Latin letters and has exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.
