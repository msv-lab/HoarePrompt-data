Precondition: **k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.**

Note: The function definition provided in the problem statement (`def func_1(k, a, b, n):`) suggests that `k` is an input parameter, but according to the problem description, `k` is a variable that Bob chooses to maximize his profit. Therefore, `k` should not be an input parameter of the function. The correct function definition should only include `a`, `b`, and `n` as parameters, like so: `def func_1(a, b, n):`.
