Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is the value of the user's input. If `count` (the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`) is 0, the if part is executed. Otherwise, if `count` is not equal to 0, the else part is executed. Specifically, if `count` is greater than 2 and even, the if part is executed. If `count` is equal to 2, the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either not immediately followed by another '1', or it is immediately followed by another '1'. Additionally, `count` can also be less than 2 or an odd number.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user's input, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the state of the variables remains as described only if `count` is not 0. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new user's input, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition. If `count` is 2, the program checks if the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1'. If it is not, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition. If `count` is not 2 and not greater than 2 and even, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
