Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new user's input, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `a`. If `count` is 2, the program checks if the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1'. If it is not, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged as described in the precondition. If `count` is not 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition.**
