`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start` and `end` remain non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.
