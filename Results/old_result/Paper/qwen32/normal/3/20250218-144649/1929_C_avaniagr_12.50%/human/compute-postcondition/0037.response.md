Postcondition: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, and `a` is the third integer from the input. The value of `a` is compared to `x + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.**
