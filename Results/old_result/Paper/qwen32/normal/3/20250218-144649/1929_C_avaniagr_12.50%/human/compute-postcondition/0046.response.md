The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least -1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `x` does not need to be changed for the loop to execute the next iteration, as long as `x + 1` is greater than `i`.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least -1, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is 2 + z // (k - 1), `i` is 2**
