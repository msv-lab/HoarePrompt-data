The initial state provides the information that `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input, and `t` must be greater than 0. However, the provided Python code snippet:

```python
print('YES')
```

does not use any of the variables `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
