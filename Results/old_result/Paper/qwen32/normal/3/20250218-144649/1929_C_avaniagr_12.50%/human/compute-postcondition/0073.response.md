In the given initial state, we have conditions that define the value of `z` based on the value of `k` and `x`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, `t`, and `z` do not influence what is printed by this statement. The string `'YES'` is a constant and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
