The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes `k`, `x`, and `a` as integers and `t` as a value that must be greater than 0. However, these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is executed.
2. The string `'YES'` is output to the console.

Since there are no variables or conditions affecting the `print` statement in this case, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
