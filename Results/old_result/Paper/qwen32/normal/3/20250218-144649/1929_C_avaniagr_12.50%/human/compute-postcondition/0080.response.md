Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `k`, `x`, and `a` for each of the `t` test cases, where `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`. For each test case, the function performs some computation (not detailed here) and returns a result based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.**
