The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `x + 1 - 1`, which is `x`.

However, since the loop condition is `i in range(x + 1)`, the next value of `i` should be `x + 1` to start the next iteration. But since the range is exclusive of the end value, the loop will not execute again if `i` is set to `x + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be set to the next value after the current `i`, which is `x + 1` minus the loop's step (which is 1 by default), so `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is `1 + 1 + 1 // (k - 1)`, `i` is `x + 1`**
