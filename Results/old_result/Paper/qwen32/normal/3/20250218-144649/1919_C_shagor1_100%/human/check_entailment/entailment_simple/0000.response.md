### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of the penalties of these subsequences is minimized. The penalty of a subsequence is the number of indices where the element at the next index is greater than the current element.

The provided program works as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `la` and `lb` are initialized to `n + 1` (a value greater than any possible element in the array).
   - `ans` is initialized to `0` to keep track of the total penalty.

2. **Processing the array**:
   - For each element `i` in the input array:
     - If `i` is less than or equal to `la`, update `la` to `i`.
     - Otherwise, if `i` is less than or equal to `lb`, update `lb` to `i`.
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`. In this case, we increment the penalty `ans` by `1` and update `la` to `lb` and `lb` to `i`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the value of `ans` is printed as the minimum penalty for that test case.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:

- The algorithm effectively tries to maintain two "chains" (`la` and `lb`), where each chain represents the end of a potential subsequence.
- When a new element `i` is encountered:
  - If `i` can be added to the first chain (i.e., `i <= la`), it is added there.
  - If `i` cannot be added to the first chain but can be added to the second chain (i.e., `i <= lb`), it is added there.
  - If `i` cannot be added to either chain, it means a new "chain" needs to be started, and the penalty is incremented by `1`.
  
This approach ensures that we are minimizing the number of chains (and thus the penalty) by always trying to add new elements to existing chains if possible.

### Verification with Provided Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Possible split: `s=[2,4,5]`, `t=[1,3]`. Penalty: `p(s)=2`, `p(t)=1`. Total penalty: `3`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `8`, `8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Possible split: `s=[8,3,1]`, `t=[2,1,7,4,3]`. Penalty: `p(s)=0`, `p(t)=1`. Total penalty: `1`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5`, `3 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Possible split: `s=[]`, `t=[3,3,3,3,3]`. Penalty: `p(s)=0`, `p(t)=0`. Total penalty: `0`.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1`, `1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Possible split: `s=[]`, `t=[1]`. Penalty: `p(s)=0`, `p(t)=0`. Total penalty: `0`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Possible split: `s=[2]`, `t=[1]`. Penalty: `p(s)=0`, `p(t)=0`. Total penalty: `0`.

The provided program correctly handles all the test cases and adheres to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences.

**Correctness: True**
