The provided function `func_1` does not accept any parameters according to the given code snippet. However, the output description mentions `t`, `n`, and `m` as integers within certain ranges, which suggests these might be parameters or variables used within the function body, even though they are not explicitly listed in the function signature. Given the constraints and the typical structure of such problems, we can infer that `t` likely represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers that the function processes.

Based on this, we can assume the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the integers `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` (both between 1 and 100). The specific functionality, such as what is returned based on `n` and `m`, is not detailed, but it performs some operation or check using these values for each test case.**
