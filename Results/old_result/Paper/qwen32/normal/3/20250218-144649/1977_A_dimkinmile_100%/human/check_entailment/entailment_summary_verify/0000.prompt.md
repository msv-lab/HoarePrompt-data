You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `m` for each of `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. If so, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove 1 cube in each move.
- Given `n` moves and `m` cubes, determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The answer should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes). It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Logic Check:
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:** This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and to achieve a specific number of cubes, the net effect of all moves (additions and subtractions) must be an even number.
- **Condition `n - m >= 0`:** This ensures that the number of moves is at least the number of cubes. This is because if `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes since you can't remove more cubes than you have.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** `n = 1`, `m = 0` - This should be "Yes" because you can remove 1 cube from an initially empty tower.
- **Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 1` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in the first move and remove 1 in the second, or vice versa.
- **Case 3:** `n = 3`, `m = 3` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in each of the 3 moves.
- **Case 4:** `n = 2`, `m = 3` - This should be "No" because you can't have 3 cubes with only 2 moves.
- **Case 5:** `n = 5`, `m = 3` - This should be "Yes" because you can add 1 cube in 3 moves and remove 1 in the other 2 moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. It checks both the parity of the difference and ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes. The program should work correctly for all edge cases and examples provided.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given conditions.
