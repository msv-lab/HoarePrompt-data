### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing one cube.

The key insight is that the difference between `n` (the number of moves) and `m` (the desired number of cubes) must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. This is because:
- If `n - m` is even, it means that the number of additions and subtractions can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes.
- If `n - m` is non-negative, it means that we have enough moves to potentially add up to `m` cubes (since we can't remove more cubes than we add initially).

The function `func_1()` correctly implements this logic by checking if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", indicating that it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program:
- For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the difference `n - m` is `0`, which is even and non-negative, so the output is "Yes".
- For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the difference `n - m` is `-2`, which is not non-negative, so the output is "No".
- For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the difference `n - m` is `2`, which is even and non-negative, so the output is "Yes".
