### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The solution should output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

#### Key Insight:
- **Even Difference:** Each move adds or removes one cube. For the net change to be exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because any net change must be achieved through pairs of moves (one addition and one removal) or a single addition/removal, making the net difference always even.
- **Non-negative Difference:** The number of moves `n` must be at least the number of cubes `m` to achieve the desired number of cubes, ensuring `n - m >= 0`.

#### Code Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the state before the function call is correct (`t` is the number of test cases, and `n` and `m` are within the valid range for each test case).
- Inside the function, the logic correctly checks the conditions and prints the appropriate result.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the necessary conditions for achieving exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The code correctly implements these conditions and handles the input/output as specified in the problem description.

#### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description, the logic explained, and the annotations provided.

### Final: **True**
