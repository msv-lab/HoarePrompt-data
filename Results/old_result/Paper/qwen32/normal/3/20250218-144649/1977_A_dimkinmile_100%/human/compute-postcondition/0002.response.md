The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides some conditions on the integers `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these conditions do not affect the execution or output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 100\).
   - The current value of `n` is greater than or equal to `m` with the difference \(n - m\) being an even number.

2. The Python code snippet is:
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Therefore, the output of the code is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
