### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing a single cube.

Let's analyze the solution step-by-step to ensure the program correctly implements the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read first.
   - For each test case, two integers `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes) are read.

2. **Logic:**
   - The key insight is that each move either adds or removes one cube. Therefore, the net effect of `n` moves can be any even number within the range from `-n` to `n`.
   - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative:
     - **Even Difference:** This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change, or a net change of Â±2 cubes. Therefore, the total difference `n - m` must be even to be achievable.
     - **Non-negative Difference:** This ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`, which means it's possible to add enough cubes to reach `m` (or remove enough cubes if `m` is 0).

3. **Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` handles the logic for each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `m`, checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, and prints "Yes" if both conditions are met, otherwise "No".

### Evaluation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described above. Let's verify the conditions:
- **Even Difference:** The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference is even.
- **Non-negative Difference:** The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach the desired number of cubes.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program checks both necessary conditions and outputs "Yes" or "No" based on those conditions.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the logic explained.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
