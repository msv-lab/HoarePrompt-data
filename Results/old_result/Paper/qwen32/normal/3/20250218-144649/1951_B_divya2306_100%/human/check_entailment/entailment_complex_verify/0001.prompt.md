You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

If it checks all elements without finding one greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` will be `n` and `wins` will be `n`. If it breaks early, `i` will be the index where the condition `a[i] > a[k-1]` is met, and `wins` will be the number of elements checked before breaking.
    #
    #In natural language:
    #- The variable `i` will be the index where the loop broke (i.e., the first index `i` such that `a[i] > a[k-1]`), or `n` if no such index exists.
    #- The variable `wins` will be the number of elements in `a` up to index `i-1` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, or `n` if all elements are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
    #
    #Output State:

    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, k - wins) if wins != 0, otherwise k - 1 (where wins is an unknown integer and k is the value of win_with_swap)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. It then determines the number of elements in the list that are less than or equal to the element at index `k-1` (1-based index). If this count is at least `k`, it prints `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum of `wins - 1` and the number of additional elements that can be included in the top `k` by potentially swapping the element at index `k-1` with a larger element later in the list, and prints this value. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win if we can swap it with any other cow exactly once or choose not to swap at all. The cow with the higher rating wins each match.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cows) and `k` (the index of the cow we are interested in).
   - It then reads the list of ratings `a` for the cows.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of matches cow `k` can win if no swap is made.
   - It iterates through the list of ratings from the beginning (position 1) and counts how many cows have a rating less than or equal to cow `k`'s rating.
   - This count is stored in the variable `wins`.

3. **Handling the Case When `wins >= k`:**
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means cow `k` can win all the matches up to its initial position and more, which is not possible as there are only `k-1` matches before it.
   - Therefore, the program prints `wins - 1` in this case. This seems incorrect because if `wins >= k`, cow `k` should win all `k-1` matches before it, not `wins - 1`.

4. **Calculating Wins with Swap:**
   - The program then calculates the number of matches cow `k` can win if it is swapped to a position where it can win more matches.
   - It considers the possibility of swapping cow `k` to a position where it can win more matches by iterating through the list from the position `win_with_swap` to `k-2` (inclusive).
   - The variable `win_with_swap` is initially set to `wins + 1` because if cow `k` is swapped, it can at least win the match it was initially supposed to lose.
   - The program then calculates the maximum number of wins between the no-swap case and the swap case.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Handling of `wins >= k`:** The program incorrectly handles the case when `wins >= k` by printing `wins - 1`. It should print `k - 1` because cow `k` can win all `k-1` matches before it.
- **Logic for Calculating `win_with_swap`:** The logic for calculating `win_with_swap` seems incorrect. The loop should iterate through the list from `win_with_swap` to `k-2` to check if cow `k` can win more matches if swapped to a position before `k`.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
