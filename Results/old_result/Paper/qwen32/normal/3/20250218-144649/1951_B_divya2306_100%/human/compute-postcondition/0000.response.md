The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints. The list `a` is also mentioned but not modified by the given code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input. The variable `t` and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
