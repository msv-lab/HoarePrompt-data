Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. It then determines the number of elements in the list that are less than or equal to the element at index `k-1` (1-based index). If this count is at least `k`, it prints `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum of `wins - 1` and the number of additional elements that can be included in the top `k` by potentially swapping the element at index `k-1` with a larger element later in the list, and prints this value. The function does not return any value.**
