The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`. If `i` is less than `k - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `win_with_swap` is 1, and `k` is at least 2.

Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1. The values of `win_with_swap` and `k` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

State: **`win_with_swap` is 1, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
