The provided code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were provided in the initial state. The list `a` now contains the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different.**
