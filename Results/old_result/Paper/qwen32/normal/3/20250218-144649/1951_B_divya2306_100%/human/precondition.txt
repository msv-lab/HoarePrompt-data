t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and all a_i's are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
