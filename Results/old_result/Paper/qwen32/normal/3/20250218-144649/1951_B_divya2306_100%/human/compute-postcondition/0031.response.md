The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. Specifically, the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `win_with_swap` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. Since the loop condition is `i < k - 1`, and `i` was 1, this implies that `k - 1` must be greater than 1, thus `k` must be at least 3 to continue the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2. The values of `win_with_swap` and `k` do not need to change unless they affect the loop condition, which they do not in this case.

State: **`win_with_swap` is 2, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2**
