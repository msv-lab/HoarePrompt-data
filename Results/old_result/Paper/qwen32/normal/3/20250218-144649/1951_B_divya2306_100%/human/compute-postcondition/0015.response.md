The provided code snippet increments the variable `wins` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. The condition regarding `a[i]` and `a[k - 1]` does not influence the change in `wins` since the code snippet only includes the increment operation.

Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 3; `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
