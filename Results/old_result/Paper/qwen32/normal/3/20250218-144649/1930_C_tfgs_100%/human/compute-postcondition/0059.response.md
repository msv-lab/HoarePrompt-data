The given code snippet modifies the value of `counter[a[i]]` by decrementing it by 1. No other variables in the initial state are directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is unchanged, `j` is set to `adv`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended to it and an additional element `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `adv`, `j`, `ans`, `cnt`, or `cur`. `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**
