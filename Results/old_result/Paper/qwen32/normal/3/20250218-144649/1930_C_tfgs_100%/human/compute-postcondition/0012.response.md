The code snippet sorts the list `a` in descending order. The `counter` and `cur` variables remain unchanged. The original list `a` contained unique integers where each element at index `i` was increased by `i + 1` in the original list. After sorting, the list `a` will now be in descending order, but the relationship of each element to its original index and the increment is no longer directly preserved.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
