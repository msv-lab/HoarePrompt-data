You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), which is the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which are the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` has each count of elements in `a` decremented by 1, `cur` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `a` after decrementing each by 1, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` minus the total number of elements added to `ans` that are not part of the original list `a`, and `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted between them based on the `adv` calculations.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` has each count of elements in `a` decremented by 1, `cur` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `a` after decrementing each by 1, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted between them based on the `adv` calculations, plus `cnt` additional elements, each being the last element of `ans` at the time of the iteration minus 1.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted based on `adv` calculations
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and the next line contains `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`. The function processes each test case and returns some output based on the elements of the array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
