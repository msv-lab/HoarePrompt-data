The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`. The element appended is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`.
- `n` is greater than `len(a)`.
- `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
- `ans` is a list with two elements, both equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`.
- `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.
- `j` is 2.

The value being appended to `ans` is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `j` is 2, the value being appended is `a[i - 1] - 3`.

Thus, the updated `ans` list will have three elements, with the third element being `a[i - 1] - 3`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`, `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list with three elements, the first two are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and the third is `a[i - 1] - 3`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `j` is 2.**
