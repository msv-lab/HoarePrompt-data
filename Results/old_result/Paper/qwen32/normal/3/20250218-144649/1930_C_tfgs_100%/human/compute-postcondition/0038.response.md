The code appends another element to the list `ans`, which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Given that `j` is incremented by 2 in the previous step, the new value of `j` used in the calculation is `j + 2`. Therefore, the new element appended to `ans` is `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `a[i - 1] - j - 3`.

So, the list `ans` now contains three elements: `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 3`.

Output State: **`adv` is a positive integer; `ans` has three new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - j - 3`; `j` is `j + 2`.**
