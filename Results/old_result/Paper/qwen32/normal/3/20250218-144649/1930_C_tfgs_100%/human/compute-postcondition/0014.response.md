Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.**

This means that the list `a`, the Counter object `counter`, the variable `cur`, and the variable `cnt` remain unchanged. The new variable `ans` is initialized as an empty list.
