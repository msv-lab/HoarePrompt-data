Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), which is the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which are the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**

Natural language: The initial state remains largely unchanged except that the variable `n` is now assigned the value of the first integer input from the test case, which represents the length of the array `a`.
