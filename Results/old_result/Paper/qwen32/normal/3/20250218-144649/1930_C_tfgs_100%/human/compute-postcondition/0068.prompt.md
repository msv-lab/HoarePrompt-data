Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` has each count of elements in `a` decremented by 1, `cur` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `a` after decrementing each by 1, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` minus the total number of elements added to `ans` that are not part of the original list `a`, and `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted between them based on the `adv` calculations.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` has each count of elements in `a` decremented by 1, `cur` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `a` after decrementing each by 1, `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted between them based on the `adv` calculations, plus the last element of `ans` minus 1 appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` has each count of elements in `a` decremented by 1, `cur` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `a` after decrementing each by 1, `cnt` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, and `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted between them based on the `adv` calculations, plus the last element of `ans` minus 1 appended to it, plus another instance of the last element of `ans` minus 1 appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` has each count of elements in `a` decremented by 1, `cur` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `a` after decrementing each by 1, `cnt` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, and `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted between them based on the `adv` calculations, plus the last element of `ans` minus 1 appended to it twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
