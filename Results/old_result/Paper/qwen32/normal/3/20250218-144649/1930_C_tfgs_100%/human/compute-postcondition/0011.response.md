The code `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicates from the list `a` by converting it to a set (which inherently contains only unique elements) and then converting it back to a list. This operation does not change the values of the elements in `a`, but it does change the length and potentially the order of the list.

The `counter` object, which contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, is not updated by this operation. Therefore, `counter` may contain counts for elements that are no longer in the list `a` after the operation. However, the precondition specifies the initial state of `a` and `counter`, and we need to reflect the changes in `a` accurately.

The variable `cur` is not affected by this operation, so it remains 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers where each element at index `i` was increased by `i + 1` in the original list; `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
