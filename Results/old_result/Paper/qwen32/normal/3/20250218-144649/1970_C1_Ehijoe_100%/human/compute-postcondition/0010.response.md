Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `nodes[u]` is updated to contain `[v, v]` because `v` is appended to the existing list `[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
