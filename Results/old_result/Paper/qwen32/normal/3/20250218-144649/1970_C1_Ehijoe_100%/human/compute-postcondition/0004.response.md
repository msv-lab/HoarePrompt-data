The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `i`. The loop iterates `n - 1` times, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. Given that the problem statement already specifies that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5`, this condition is already satisfied.

Since the loop head only involves `i`, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function in Python. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` or `n` in terms of their values to ensure the loop executes.

However, the state description should reflect the conditions that ensure the loop can execute, which in this case is simply that `n` is at least 2, and `i` starts from 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n representing the starting nodes for each round, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is 0**
