The code snippet provided is `prev = curr`. This line of code assigns the current value of `curr` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given that `prev` was previously assigned the value of `curr`, this assignment does not change the value of `prev` further since it is already equal to `curr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is not equal to `e`**.

In natural language: The value of `prev` is now explicitly set to `curr`, but since `prev` was already equal to `curr`, there is no change in the values of the variables. All other variables retain their initial values.
