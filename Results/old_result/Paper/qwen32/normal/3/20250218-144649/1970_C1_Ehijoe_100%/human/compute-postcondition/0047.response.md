The code snippet `curr = nodes[curr][0]` updates the value of `curr` by assigning it the first element of the list `nodes[curr]`. Since `curr` was initially an element in `nodes[prev]` but not equal to `e`, and `nodes[curr]` is a list, `curr` is now set to the first element of this list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is the first element of `nodes[curr]`**.
