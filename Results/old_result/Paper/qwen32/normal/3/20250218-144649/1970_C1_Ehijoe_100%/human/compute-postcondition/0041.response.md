Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is either `nodes[curr][0]` or `nodes[curr][1]` depending on whether `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev` or not.**

In simpler terms: **`n` remains an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `t` remains 1, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains `True`, `nodes` retains its structure as a defaultdict of lists, `i` remains n-2, `ends` remains a list of keys from `nodes` with a length of 1, `s` and `e` remain the first and second elements of `ends` respectively, `tree` contains `[s, curr]`, `prev` is updated to `curr`, and `curr` is updated to either `nodes[curr][0]` or `nodes[curr][1]` based on whether `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`.**
