Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), and an integer `t` which is always 1. It also accepts `n-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree. Additionally, it accepts a final line with `t` integers `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for a round. The function is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The function returns a value based on the given tree structure and starting node, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
