Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with at least one key-value pair, `i` is n-2, and `ends` is a list containing `key` if the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, otherwise `ends` remains unchanged. `key` is another key from the `nodes` dictionary that has not yet been processed.**

This postcondition captures the state of all variables after the if-else block, considering both the case where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1 and where it is not.
