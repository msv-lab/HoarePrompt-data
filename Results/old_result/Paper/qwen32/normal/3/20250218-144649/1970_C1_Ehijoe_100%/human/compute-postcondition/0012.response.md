The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 2**
