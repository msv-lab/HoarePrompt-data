The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. This means that the values of `u` and `v` will be specific integers based on the input provided. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is 0**
