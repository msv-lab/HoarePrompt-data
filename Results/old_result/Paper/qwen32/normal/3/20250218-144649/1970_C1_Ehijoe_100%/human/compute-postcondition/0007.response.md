The code appends `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Given the initial state, `nodes[u]` already contains `[v]`. After the execution of the code, `nodes[v]` will contain `[u]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u]`, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains an integer within the range 2 to 200,000, `t` remains 1, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains `True`, `nodes` now has `nodes[u]` containing `[v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u]`, and `i` remains 0.
