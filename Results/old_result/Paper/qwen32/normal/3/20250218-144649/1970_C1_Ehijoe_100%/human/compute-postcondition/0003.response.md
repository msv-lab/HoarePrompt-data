Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n representing the starting nodes for each round. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` which will store lists as values for keys. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`) remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.
