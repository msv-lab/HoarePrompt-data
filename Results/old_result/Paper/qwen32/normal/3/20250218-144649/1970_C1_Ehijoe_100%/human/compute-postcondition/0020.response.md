The code snippet `ends.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `ends`. Since `ends` was initially an empty list, after the execution, `ends` will contain one element, which is `key`.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with at least one key-value pair, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing `key`, and the length of `nodes[key]` is 1.**
