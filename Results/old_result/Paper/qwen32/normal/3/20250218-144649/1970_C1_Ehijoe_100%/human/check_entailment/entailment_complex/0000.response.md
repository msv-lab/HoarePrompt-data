### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the winner of a game played on a tree structure with exactly two leaves. The game involves moving a stone from a starting node to either of the leaves, with players taking turns. The player who cannot make a move loses. The program correctly identifies the two leaves of the tree, reconstructs the path between them, and calculates the number of moves from the starting node to each leaf. The winner is determined based on whether the number of moves to either leaf is odd or even.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1 in this version). It then reads the edges of the tree and stores them in an adjacency list representation.

2. **Identifying Leaves**: The program identifies the two leaves of the tree by finding the nodes with only one neighbor.

3. **Reconstructing the Path**: It then reconstructs the path between the two leaves by starting from one leaf and following the neighbors until it reaches the other leaf. This path is stored in the `tree` list.

4. **Calculating Moves**: The program calculates the number of moves from the starting node to each leaf by finding the index of the starting node in the `tree` list. It then calculates the number of moves to the leaf at the start of the list (`idx`) and the number of moves to the leaf at the end of the list (`n - idx - 1`).

5. **Determining the Winner**: If either of these move counts is odd, Ron wins because he can force a win by making the last move. If both are even, Hermione wins because she can force a win by making the last move.

6. **Output**: The program prints "Ron" if Ron wins and "Hermione" if Hermione wins.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the given constraints. The provided examples also match the expected output, confirming the correctness of the program.
