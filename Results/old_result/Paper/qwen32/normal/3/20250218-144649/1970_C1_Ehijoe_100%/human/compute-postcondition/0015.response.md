The code appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains `[u, u]`. After appending `u`, `nodes[v]` will contain `[u, u, u]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u, u, u]`, `i` is 2**.
