Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))//2, 2 * 10^5). Each edge is represented by three integers u, v, and w, where 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
