Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n + 1`; all iterations of the loop have finished.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will have been incremented to `n + 1`, meaning the loop has processed each element from `a[1]` to `a[n]`. The list `b` will have been updated such that each `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `x` values, where `x` is 1 if the corresponding `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2. The other variables, including `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and the queries, remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
