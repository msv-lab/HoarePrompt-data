The given code snippet initializes a new list `a` by reading a line of input, splitting it into integers, and converting each one to an integer. The list `a` is prefixed with a `0` at the beginning.

Given the initial state, `c` is a list of `n` integers, and the input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers that will be converted to form the list `a` starting from index 1 (since index 0 is set to `0`).

After the code execution, `a` will be a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
