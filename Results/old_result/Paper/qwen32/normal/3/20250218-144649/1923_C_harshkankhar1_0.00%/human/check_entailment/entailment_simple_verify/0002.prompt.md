You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Definition of a Good Array**: The array `a` is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that:
   - The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
   - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For `b` to have the same sum as `a` and all elements positive, `b` must be constructed such that each element `b[i]` is different from `a[i]` but still positive.
   - If an element `a[i]` is greater than 1, we can set `b[i]` to 1, and the sum condition can be satisfied by adjusting other elements.
   - If `a[i]` is 1, we need to set `b[i]` to a value greater than 1, such as 2, to ensure `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] != b[i]`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, we need to handle `q` queries.
   - For each query, we need to check if the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is good.
   - We can precompute prefix sums for the array `a` to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
   - We also need to precompute a corresponding array `b` such that the conditions are met and calculate its prefix sums.
   - For each query, we compare the sum of the subarray in `a` with the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `a` is initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning for easier prefix sum calculations.
   - The array `b` is initialized with 0s and then filled based on the values of `a`.

2. **Filling Array `b`**:
   - For each element in `a`, if `a[i] > 1`, `b[i]` is set to 1.
   - If `a[i] == 1`, `b[i]` is set to 2.
   - This ensures that `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] != b[i]` for all `i`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums for `a` and `b` are calculated using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the sum of the subarray in `a` is compared with the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - If the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if the subarray length is 1 (i.e., `x == y`), the subarray is not good, and "NO" is printed.
   - Otherwise, "YES" is printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray length is 1 (`x == y`). If `x == y`, the subarray is not good because `b[i]` will always be different from `a[i]`, but the program incorrectly prints "YES".
- The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is not sufficient to determine if a subarray is good. The program should check if the sums are equal and if all elements in the subarray are different in `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where the subarray length is 1 and does not properly check the conditions for a subarray to be good.
