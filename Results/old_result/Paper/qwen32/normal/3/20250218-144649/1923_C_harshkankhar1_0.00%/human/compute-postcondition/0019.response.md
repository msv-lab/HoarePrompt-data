Output State: **`x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative sum of the original `a[0]` to `a[i]`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n + 1`.**

In natural language: The values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the two integers read from the input. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
