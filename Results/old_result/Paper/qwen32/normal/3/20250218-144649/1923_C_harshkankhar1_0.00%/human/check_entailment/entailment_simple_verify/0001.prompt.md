You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, it does not properly check the conditions for the subarray to be good.

Here are some issues with the code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `b` Array**: The `b` array is supposed to be an array of integers where each element is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the `a` array. However, the current implementation of `b` only sets `b[i]` to 1 if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise it sets `b[i]` to 2. This does not guarantee that `b[i]` is different from `a[i]` for all `i`. For example, if `a[i]` is 2, then `b[i]` will also be 2, which violates the condition `a_i ≠ b_i`.

2. **Incorrect Check for Good Subarray**: The check `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good. The condition for a subarray to be good is that the sum of the subarray in `a` should be equal to the sum of the subarray in `b`, and all elements in `b` should be different from the corresponding elements in `a` and greater than 0.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the case when `x == y` correctly. According to the problem, if `x == y`, the subarray is just a single element. The code currently prints 'NO' in this case, which is incorrect. The subarray is good if `a[x] ≠ b[x]` and `b[x] > 0`.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 2 1
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The subarray is just the element `1` at index 1.
- We can choose `b[1] = 2` (which is greater than 0 and different from `a[1]`).
- The sum of the subarray in `a` is `1`, and the sum of the subarray in `b` is `2`, but since the subarray has only one element, we only need to check `a[1] ≠ b[1]` and `b[1] > 0`, which is true.

However, the provided program will print `NO` for this input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
