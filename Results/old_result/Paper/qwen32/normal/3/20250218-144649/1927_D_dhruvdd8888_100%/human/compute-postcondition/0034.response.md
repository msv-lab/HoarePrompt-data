To determine what will be printed by the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to represent the number of test cases, but it is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
2. **`N`**: An integer read from input.
3. **`n`**: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
4. **`nums`**: A list of \(n + 1\) integers where the first \(n\) integers are the original numbers and the last integer is `-1`.
5. **`q`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\), representing the number of queries.
6. **`l` and `r`**: Integers read from input such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n + 1\).
7. **`s`**: The start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
8. **`e`**: The end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
9. **`num`**: The value of `nums[N]`.
10. **`arr`**: A list of tuples \((start\_index, end\_index, number)\) representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
11. **`LA`**: The length of `arr` minus 1, i.e., `LA = len(arr) - 1`.
12. **`eli`**: The index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.
13. **Conditions**: 
    - The current value of `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1.
    - `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `s` is the start index of a segment in `arr` found at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- The variable `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.
- Given the conditions, `s` must be greater than `l` and less than or equal to `r`.
- The `print(s - 1, s)` statement will output two consecutive integers, `s - 1` and `s`.

### Output:
Based on the conditions and the given information, the exact values of `s - 1` and `s` depend on the specific values of `s` and `l` which are not explicitly provided. However, we can describe the output precisely using the conditions.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` and is greater than `l` and less than or equal to `r`)**
