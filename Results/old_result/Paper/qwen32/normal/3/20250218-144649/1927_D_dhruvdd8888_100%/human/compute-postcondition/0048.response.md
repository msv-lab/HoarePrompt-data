Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from input such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted. If `s` > `l`, `s` remains the same unless `s` equals 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, in which case the conditions remain unchanged. If `s` <= `l`, then `e` is such that if `e` >= `r`, `e` remains the same, otherwise `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`, the condition `e < N or e < l` holds. Otherwise, `e` is less than or equal to `N` and `e` is greater than or equal to `l`.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `q`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA` remain unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` are updated to the values read from the input, ensuring that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`.
