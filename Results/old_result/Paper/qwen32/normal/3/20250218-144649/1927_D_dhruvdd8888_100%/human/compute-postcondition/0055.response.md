To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to understand the values and relationships of the variables involved based on the given initial state.

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
   - `N` is an integer read from input.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5.
   - `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`.
   - `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5.
   - `l` and `r` are integers read from input such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.
   - `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `num` is `nums[N]`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted. This means `eli` is the position in `arr` where the segment that starts at `l` begins.
   - `LA` is the last index of `arr`, i.e., the total number of segments minus one.
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that we do not go out of bounds of `arr`. If `eli` is greater than `LA`, it would mean `eli` is beyond the last segment, and we would use `LA` instead.
   - `s` is the start index of the segment at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is the end index of the segment at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the start index `s` and the end index `e` of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, with `e + 1` to get the inclusive end index.

Given the above, the output will be:
- `s`: The start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `e + 1`: The end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, incremented by 1 to be inclusive.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, and e + 1 is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, incremented by 1)**
