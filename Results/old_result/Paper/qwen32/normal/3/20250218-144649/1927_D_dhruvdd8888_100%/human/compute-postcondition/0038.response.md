The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the values `-1` and `-1`. The initial state and other variables described in the precondition do not influence the values printed by this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1, -1`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `print(-1, -1)` directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
