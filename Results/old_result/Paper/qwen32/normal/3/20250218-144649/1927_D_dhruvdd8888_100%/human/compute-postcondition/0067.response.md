The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the values `-1, -1`. This output is explicitly specified in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or their values described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, such as `t`, `N`, `nums`, `q`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, and `eli`. However, these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`, which directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables described in the initial state, the output is simply the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
