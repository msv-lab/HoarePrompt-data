To determine what will be printed by the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` in the context of the given initial state.

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer (1 <= `t` <= 10^4), not used in the given print statement.
   - `N`: An integer read from input, not directly used in the given print statement.
   - `n`: An integer (2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), the number of original elements in `nums`.
   - `nums`: A list of `n + 1` integers, where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`.
   - `q`: An integer (0 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5 - 1), not directly used in the given print statement.
   - `s`: The start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e`: The end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `num`: `nums[N]`, which is the last element of `nums` (which is `-1`).
   - `arr`: A list of tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA`: `len(arr) - 1`, the last index of `arr`.
   - `l` and `r`: Integers read from input (1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`), not directly used in the given print statement.
   - `eli`: The index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.

2. **Determining the value of `s`:**
   - `s` is defined as the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.
   - Since `s` is the start index of the segment at the index `min(eli, LA)`, it is the start index of the segment at the position `eli` if `eli` is less than or equal to `LA`; otherwise, it is the start index of the segment at the position `LA`.

3. **Output of the print statement:**
   - The print statement outputs `s - 1` and `s`.
   - `s` is the start index of a segment in `arr`, so `s - 1` is one less than the start index of that segment.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `s - 1` without knowing the specific values of `arr` and `eli`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`)**
