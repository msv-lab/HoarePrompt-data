Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and execution summary to determine its correctness.

### Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`N`), the array itself (`nums`), the number of queries (`q`), and then the queries.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program uses a loop to segment the array into contiguous segments of identical numbers. 
   - It stores these segments in `arr` as tuples of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`.
   - It appends `-1` to `nums` to simplify the loop logic, ensuring that the last segment is processed.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after the query's left index.
   - It then checks the segment's start and end indices to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found within the query range.
   - The logic includes several conditions to check if a valid pair exists, printing the indices if a pair is found or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Query Index Handling:** The problem specifies that indices are 1-based, but the program treats them as 0-based. This can lead to incorrect results.
- **Logic Flaws:** The logic for determining valid pairs of indices within a query range seems flawed. For instance, the conditions to check if a valid pair exists are not correctly implemented.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases effectively, such as when the entire queried segment contains the same number.

### Example:
Let's consider the first test case from the example:
- `N = 5`, `nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, `q = 3`, `queries = [(1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3)]`.
- The program segments `nums` into `arr = [(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`.
- For the first query `(1, 5)`, it finds the segment `(1, 2, 1)` and incorrectly concludes that a valid pair exists at indices `s-1, s` which are `0, 1` (0-based), but the program should output `2, 3` (1-based).
- For the second query `(1, 2)`, it finds the segment `(1, 2, 1)` and incorrectly concludes that no valid pair exists, but the program should output `-1, -1` since there is no valid pair in the 1-based index range.
- For the third query `(1, 3)`, it finds the segment `(1, 2, 1)` and incorrectly concludes that a valid pair exists at indices `s, e+1` which are `1, 4` (0-based), but the program should output `2, 3` (1-based).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the queries due to incorrect index handling and flawed logic for determining valid pairs of indices.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
