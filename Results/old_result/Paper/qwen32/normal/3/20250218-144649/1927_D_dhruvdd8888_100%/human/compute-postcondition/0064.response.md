The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` without any dependency on the variables or objects defined in the initial state. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the `print` statement and do not change based on any conditions or calculations within the initial state.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
