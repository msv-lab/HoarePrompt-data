The code snippet appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains the values `(1 + s, i, num)`. Given the initial state, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, and `num` is `nums[0]`. Therefore, the tuple `(1 + 0, 0, nums[0])` or `(1, 0, nums[0])` is appended to `arr`.

The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `i` remain unchanged except for `arr`, which now includes the new tuple. The variable `arr` is no longer an empty list but contains one tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is [(1, 0, `nums[0]`)], `i` is 0, and `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
