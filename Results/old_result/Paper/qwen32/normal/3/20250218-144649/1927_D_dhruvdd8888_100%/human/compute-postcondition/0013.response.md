The code snippet `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `num` will be assigned the value of `nums[0]`. Since `num` was previously set to `nums[0]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `num`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same except for the fact that the assignment operation has been executed, which does not alter the value of `num` in this specific case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is either empty or contains the tuple (1, 0, `nums[0]`) if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`; `i` is 0.**
