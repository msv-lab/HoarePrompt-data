The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the `print` statement and will be printed as is.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly given in the statement.
3. None of the variables or objects in the initial state (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `q`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`) are used in this `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be exactly `-1, -1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
