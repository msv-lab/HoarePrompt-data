Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `edges` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, and `t`) retain their initial values.
