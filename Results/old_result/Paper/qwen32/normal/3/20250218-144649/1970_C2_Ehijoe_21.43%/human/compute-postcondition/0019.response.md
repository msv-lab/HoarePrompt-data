Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair where the length of the value for some key (referred to as `key`) is 1, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `leaves` is an empty deque. The current value of `len(nodes[key])` is 1.**
