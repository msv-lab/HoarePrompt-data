Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, with `nodes[u]` including `v` and `nodes[v]` including `u`; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `u` is the first integer from the new input, `v` is the second integer from the new input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` adds the node `u` to the list of neighbors for node `v` in the `nodes` defaultdict. All other variables remain unchanged.
