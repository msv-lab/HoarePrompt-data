Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    nodes[u].append(v)
    nodes[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, with `nodes[u]` including `v` and `nodes[v]` now including `u`; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0, `u` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, with `nodes[u]` including `v` and `nodes[v]` including `u`; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `u` is the first integer from the new input, `v` is the second integer from the new input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, with `nodes[u]` including `v` and `nodes[v]` including `u`; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 2, `u` is the first integer from the new input, `v` is the second integer from the new input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
