The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` deque. This means the `leaves` deque now contains the previous keys with a single value in `nodes` plus the new `key` that was appended. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `leaves` is a deque containing keys with a single value in `nodes` plus the new `key`, `key` is the next key in `nodes`.**
