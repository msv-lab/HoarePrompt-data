The code snippet `leaves.append(key)` adds the variable `key` to the end of the `leaves` deque. The initial state specifies that `leaves` is a deque containing keys with a single value in `nodes`. After executing the code, `leaves` will now include this new `key` in addition to the keys it previously contained.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, and `leaves` is a deque containing keys with a single value in `nodes` and the new `key`.**
