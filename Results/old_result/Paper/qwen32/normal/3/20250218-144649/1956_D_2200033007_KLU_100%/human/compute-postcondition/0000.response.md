The provided code snippet simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `is_already_stairs`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `start_index`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change in `is_already_stairs` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), and `arr` is a list of integers; `is_already_stairs` is True.**
