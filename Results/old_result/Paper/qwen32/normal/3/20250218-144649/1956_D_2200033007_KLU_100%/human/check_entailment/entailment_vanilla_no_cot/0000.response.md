Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Global Variables and Scope Issues**: The program uses global variables (`res_dict`, `arr`, `res`, `start_index`) without proper initialization or passing them as parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) for a given subarray. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, which is not how it is calculated in the code.

3. **Logic Errors in `func_1` and `func_2`**: The logic for calculating the maximum possible sum and constructing the operations is flawed. The recursive approach seems to be aiming for a dynamic programming solution, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation or the construction of the operations.

4. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `make_stairs` function is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to transform the subarray into a staircase of increasing integers.

5. **Output Construction**: The program does not correctly construct the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

To correctly solve the problem, a more appropriate approach would involve calculating the MEX for each possible subarray and using it to update the array to maximize the sum. The operations should be constructed based on this MEX calculation. The code provided does not follow this approach and hence is incorrect.
