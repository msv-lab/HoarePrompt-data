The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range it is iterating over, which is `i + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which is `0` (since the range starts from `0`).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `0`.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.**
