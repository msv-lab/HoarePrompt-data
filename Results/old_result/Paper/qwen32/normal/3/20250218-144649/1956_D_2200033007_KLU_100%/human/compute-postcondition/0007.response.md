Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `j` is `i + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.**
