The function `make_stairs` modifies a list `arr` starting from a given `start_index` such that the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i` if they do not already form a "staircase" pattern (where each element `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j`). It also appends tuples to a list `res` indicating the ranges modified. The function does not return any value.
