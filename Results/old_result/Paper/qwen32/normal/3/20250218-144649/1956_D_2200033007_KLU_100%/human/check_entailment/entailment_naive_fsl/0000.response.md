Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incomplete and Undefined Functions and Variables**:
   - The code references `res_dict`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, and `make_stairs` but these are not defined or initialized within the provided code snippet.
   - The function `make_stairs` uses `start_index` which is not passed as an argument and not defined within the function.
   - The `res` list which is supposed to store the operations is not defined or initialized.

2. **Logic Errors in `func_2`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is incomplete and does not handle all cases correctly. For example, it does not properly handle the case when the maximum value is achieved by modifying the array between `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - The function does not ensure that the operations are correctly constructed and stored in `res`.

3. **Logic Errors in `make_stairs`**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is supposed to construct a sequence of operations to make the array a staircase sequence. However, the implementation is incomplete and does not handle all cases correctly.
   - The function does not ensure that the operations are correctly constructed and stored in `res`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The code does not properly output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations as required by the problem description.
   - The code does not ensure that the output format is correct, which includes the number of operations and the sequence of operations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when the array is already in the optimal state or when the array has all elements as zero.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
