To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and the range parameters `start_index` and `start_index + i + 1`. Since `start_index` and `i` are not modified within the loop head, they remain the same. The variable `j` is the one that will be incremented for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`)
- `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is now `i` and `arr[j]` for `j != start_index` retains its previous value
- `is_already_stairs` is False
- `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called
- `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`
- `j` is `start_index`

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken the value `start_index + i` (the last value in the range `range(start_index, start_index + i + 1)`).

For the next iteration to occur, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be `start_index + i + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The range `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` will still be valid because `j` is incremented within this range.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is now `i` and `arr[j]` for `j != start_index` retains its previous value, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `j` is `start_index + i + 1`**
