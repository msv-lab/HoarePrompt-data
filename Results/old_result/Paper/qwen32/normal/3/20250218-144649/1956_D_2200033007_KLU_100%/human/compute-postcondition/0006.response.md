Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `j` is `i + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `is_already_stairs` has been explicitly set to False by the code. All other variables (`i`, `start_index`, `j`, and `arr`) retain their initial values and conditions.
