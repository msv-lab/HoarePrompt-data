Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), and `arr` is a list of integers. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is set to False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.**
