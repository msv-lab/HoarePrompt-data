The code snippet `res.append((start_index, start_index))` appends a tuple containing two elements, both equal to `start_index`, to the list `res`. The values of `i`, `start_index`, `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False; `res` contains an additional tuple `(start_index, start_index)`**.
