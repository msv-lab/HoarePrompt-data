The code snippet assigns the value `i` to the element at index `j` in the list `arr`. Given the initial state, the value of `arr[j]` is now `i`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[j]` is `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`**.
