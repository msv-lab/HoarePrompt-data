### Reasoning:

The given program appears to be attempting to solve the problem by using a recursive approach with memoization. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by considering all possible ways to split the subarray and choosing the best one.
   - It uses memoization (via `res_dict`) to store already computed results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Function `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It recursively determines which subarray splits or end points to use to achieve the maximum sum and records the operations.

3. **Function `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function is intended to create a sequence of operations to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern (where the elements are `[0, 1, 2, ..., i]`).
   - However, it has a few issues:
     - It modifies the global `arr` array directly, which could lead to incorrect states if not managed properly.
     - It references a global `res` list that is not defined within the function or passed as an argument, leading to potential errors.

### Issues Identified:
- **Global State Modification**: The function `make_stairs` modifies the global `arr` array and a global `res` list. This can lead to incorrect states and is not a good practice in functional programming or recursion.
- **Undefined `res` List**: The `res` list used in `make_stairs` is not defined within the function or passed as an argument, which will cause a `NameError`.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `make_stairs` assumes that `res` is a global list and modifies it directly, which is not how the function `func_2` is structured to use it.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, particularly the modification of global state and undefined variables, the program is not correct as it stands. These issues can lead to incorrect results and runtime errors.

**Correctness: False**
