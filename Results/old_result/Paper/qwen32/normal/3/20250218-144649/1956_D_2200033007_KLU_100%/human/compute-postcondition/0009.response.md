The code snippet explicitly sets the variable `is_already_stairs` to `False`. This change affects the output state, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False.**
