The code snippet `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Given the initial state, `prime_to_i` is initially 1, and `prime` is `primes[k]`.

After the operation, `prime_to_i` will be equal to `prime` because `1 * prime` is `prime`.

The other variables (`k`, `prime`, `primes`, `factors`, `rest`, `factor`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime`, and `factor` is the next element in the `rest` collection; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
