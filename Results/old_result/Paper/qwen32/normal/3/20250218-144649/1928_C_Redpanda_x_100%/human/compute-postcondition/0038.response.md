Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the `primes` list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, `factor` is the next element in the `rest` collection; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields a value but does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that a value has been yielded.
