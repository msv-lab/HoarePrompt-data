Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded**

In natural language: The value of `prime_to_i` has been updated to be the product of its previous value (`prime`) and `prime` again, making it `prime * prime`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
