The code snippet `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Given that `prime_to_i` is initially set to `prime`, after this operation, `prime_to_i` will be `prime * prime` or `prime^2`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `k` remains a non-negative integer.
- `prime` remains `primes[k]`.
- `primes` remains a list of primes.
- `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list.
- `factors` remains a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` as a non-negative integer.
- `rest` remains a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)`.
- `prime_to_i` is now `prime * prime`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`.**
