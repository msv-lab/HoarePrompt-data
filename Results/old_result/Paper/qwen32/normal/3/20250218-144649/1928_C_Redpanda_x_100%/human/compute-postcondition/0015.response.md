The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `prime_to_i` by the value of `prime`. Given the initial state, `prime_to_i` is initially `prime * prime`. After the execution of the code, `prime_to_i` becomes `prime * prime * prime`, which is `prime ** 3`.

Here is the output state with the updated value of `prime_to_i`:

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime_to_i` is `prime ** 3`, and `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
