The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation modifies the `heap` by removing its smallest element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case.
- `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`.
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`.
- `operations` is 2.
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.
- `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`.

After executing `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`:
- The smallest element from `heap` is removed and assigned to `smallest`.
- The `heap` is updated to reflect the removal of this smallest element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1` minus the element that was just popped, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was just removed from `heap`.**
