The loop condition in the `while` statement is `heap[0] <= current_median`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the smallest element in the `heap` must be less than or equal to the `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`.
- `current_median` is the middle element of the sorted list `arr`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `heap[0]` (the smallest element in the `heap`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap` includes `smallest + 1`, and `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped, `heap[0]` is currently `smallest + 1`. To make `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to ensure that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`. This implies that `smallest <= current_median - 1`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `smallest` to be less than or equal to `current_median - 1`. Since `heap` is a min-heap and includes `smallest + 1`, we can adjust `smallest` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that the `median_index`-th element of the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple is the smallest element in the sublist starting from `median_index`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` must be less than or equal to `current_median - 1`**
