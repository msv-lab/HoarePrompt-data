The code snippet `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that the `median_index`-th element of the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple is the smallest element in the sublist starting from `median_index`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped.**
