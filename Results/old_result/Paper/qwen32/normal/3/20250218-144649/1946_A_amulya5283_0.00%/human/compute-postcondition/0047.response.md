The code snippet sorts the list `arr`. This means that the elements of `arr` will be rearranged in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Only `arr` is modified to be in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
