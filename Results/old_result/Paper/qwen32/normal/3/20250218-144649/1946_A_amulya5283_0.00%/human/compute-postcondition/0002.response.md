The code snippet provided assigns the values from the `i`-th tuple in the `test_cases` list to the variables `n` and `arr`. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` will hold the integer from the tuple, and `arr` will hold the list of integers from the same tuple. The variables `t` and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
