The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This means that the `heap` will now not include the element that was previously the smallest, and `smallest` will hold that value.

Given the initial state, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, and `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. After executing `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`, the `heap` will have one fewer element, and `smallest` will be the smallest element that was in the heap before this operation.

Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` after this operation will be the new smallest element in the heap.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and then the smallest element of the heap is popped, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap[0]` is the new smallest element in the heap.**
