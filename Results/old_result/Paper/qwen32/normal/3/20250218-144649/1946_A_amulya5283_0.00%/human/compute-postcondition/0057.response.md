To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is true. Therefore, we need to ensure that this condition holds after the previous iteration.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the relevant variables and their roles:
- `heap[0]`: The smallest element in the heap.
- `current_median`: The median of the array `arr`.

For the loop to continue executing, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case.
- `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`.
- `operations` is 1.
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `heap[0]` and/or `current_median` such that `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`. To ensure the loop condition is met, we need `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `smallest` or `current_median` to satisfy this condition.

Example Answer:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `smallest + 1 <= current_median`. If `smallest + 1` is greater than `current_median`, we need to adjust `current_median` to be at least `smallest + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`**.
