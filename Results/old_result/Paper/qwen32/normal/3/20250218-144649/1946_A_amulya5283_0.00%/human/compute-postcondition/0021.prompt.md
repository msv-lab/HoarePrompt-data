Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and then the smallest element of the heap is popped, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap[0]` is the new smallest element in the heap, and `heap` now contains an additional element `smallest + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with one less element (the smallest element has been popped) and an additional element `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 3, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
