Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial states.
