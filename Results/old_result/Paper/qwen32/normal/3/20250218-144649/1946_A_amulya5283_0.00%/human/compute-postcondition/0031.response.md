To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is satisfied. Let's analyze the variables involved in the loop condition:

- `heap[0]`: This is the smallest element in the min-heap `heap`.
- `current_median`: This is the median of the sorted list `arr`.

Given the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index`.
- `operations` is 0.

The key variables here are `heap[0]` and `current_median`. To ensure the loop condition is true, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index`, the smallest element in `heap` is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`. For the loop to execute, this smallest element must be less than or equal to `arr[median_index]` (the `current_median`).

To make this condition true, we can adjust the `arr` list such that the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` is less than or equal to `arr[median_index]`. A straightforward way to do this is to ensure that `arr[median_index]` is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`.

Let's modify the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that the `median_index`-th element of the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple is the smallest element in the sublist starting from `median_index`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index`, `operations` is 0**

This ensures that `heap[0]` (the smallest element in `heap`) is less than or equal to `current_median` (the `median_index`-th element of `arr`), allowing the `while` loop to execute.
