To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if the range `(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)` is non-empty. This means the upper bound `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than the lower bound `1`.
2. For the range to be non-empty, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than `1`, which simplifies to `int(x ** 0.5)` being at least `1`. This is always true for `x` greater than or equal to `1` because the square root of any integer `x` that is at least `1` will be at least `1`, and adding `1` to it will result in a number greater than `1`.
3. Given the condition `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, `x` is already guaranteed to be at least `1`, so the range will always be non-empty.
4. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to `1` at the start of the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

Since the condition `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9` already ensures that the loop can execute, and no changes are needed to the loop variable `i` before the loop starts, the state does not need to be adjusted further.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list**
