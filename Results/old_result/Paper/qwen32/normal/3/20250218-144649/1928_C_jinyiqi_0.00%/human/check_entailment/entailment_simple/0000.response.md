Let's analyze the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the provided states.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding all possible values of \( k \) such that in a sequence where the first \( k \) numbers are \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \), the next \( k-2 \) numbers are \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and this pattern repeats, Vasya's position \( n \) corresponds to the number \( x \).

### Key Points:
1. The sequence repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
2. For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find all \( k \) such that the sequence matches \( x \) at position \( n \).
3. The program uses the function `func_1` to find divisors of certain expressions derived from \( n \) and \( x \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calculates divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) using `func_1` and checks if they satisfy the conditions.
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calculates divisors of \( n - x \) using `func_1` and checks if they satisfy the conditions.
   - The conditions for \( k \) are that \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - The results are collected in a list, duplicates are removed, and the length of the list is printed.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \), and for each divisor \( i \), it adds both \( i \) and \( x/i \) to the list of divisors.
   - The divisors are returned in a specific order.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly identifies the possible values of \( k \) by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequence and the properties of divisors.
- The use of `func_1` to find divisors is appropriate for the problem.
- The conditions checked for \( k \) are derived from the problem constraints and correctly filter the valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
