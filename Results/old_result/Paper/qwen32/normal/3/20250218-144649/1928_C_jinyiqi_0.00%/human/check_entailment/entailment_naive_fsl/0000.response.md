Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. The program uses a function `func_1` that is not defined in the given code, and there are logical errors in the main part of the code. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is used in the code but is not defined anywhere. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

2. **Logical Errors**: The logic for determining the possible values of `k` is incorrect. The code attempts to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and then checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value. However, it does not properly account for the pattern of the sequence and the constraints given in the problem description.

3. **Output Handling**: The program does not print the output for each test case. It calculates the possible values of `k` for each test case but does not store or print them.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work according to the problem description:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_valid_k(n, x))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version defines a function `count_valid_k` that calculates the number of valid `k` values for given `n` and `x`. It then processes each test case and prints the results. This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
