You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Annotated Code:

    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)

                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x):

    #State: 
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns the concatenation of `output2` with the reversed version of its initial state `output1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine how many possible values of `k` there are for which Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling match the pattern described. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific sequence.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received).
3. Checking two conditions related to `n` and `x`:
   - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
   - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
4. Using a function `func_1` to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
5. Filtering these divisors based on the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
6. Collecting valid `k` values and removing duplicates.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a number, but it returns the divisors in a reversed order and concatenates the list of divisors with its reverse. This is unnecessary and can lead to duplicates.
2. **Appending Valid `k` Values**: After checking the conditions and finding valid `k` values, the program appends them to the `output` list but does not print or return this output for each test case.
3. **Condition Checks**: The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are checked, but the logic for determining `k` from these conditions is not entirely clear and seems incomplete.
4. **Output Handling**: The program calculates the valid `k` values but does not handle the output correctly. It should print the number of unique valid `k` values for each test case.

### Correctness
Given the issues outlined above, the program is not correctly implementing the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be fixed to correctly determine and output the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
