The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be decremented by 1, but since `j` is already `0`, the loop will not execute again.

However, if we consider the state just before the last iteration (where the loop still has one more iteration to go), `j` would have been `1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `1`.

State: **`dp` table with `dp[0][j]` holding the value of `dp[1][j]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or the maximum value between `dp[1][j]`, `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected, `i` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 0. `j` is 1**
