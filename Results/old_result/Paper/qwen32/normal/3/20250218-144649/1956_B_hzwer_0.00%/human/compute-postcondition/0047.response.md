The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0. Therefore, `dp[0][0]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[0][0]` is the value of `dp[1][0]`, `dp[0][1]` is equal to `dp[1][1]` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is 0, `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1)` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1, dp[1][2])` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is greater than 1, `i` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 0. `j` is 0.**
