The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of two possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `cards`, and `j`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `j - 1`, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`**.
