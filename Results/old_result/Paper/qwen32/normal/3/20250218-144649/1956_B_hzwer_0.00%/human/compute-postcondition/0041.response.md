Output State: **`dp[0][1]` is equal to `dp[1][1]`, `dp` table with `dp[0][j]` holding the value of `dp[1][j]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or the maximum value between `dp[1][j]`, `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected, `i` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 0. `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `dp[0][1]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[1][1]`. All other conditions and values in the initial state remain unchanged.
