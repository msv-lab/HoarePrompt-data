The code initializes a 2D list named `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, where each element is initially set to 0. The variables `n` and `cards` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0.**
