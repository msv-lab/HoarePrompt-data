Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The function `func_1()` is not defined properly to handle the problem's requirements. The function should take into account the optimal moves for both players and simulate the game to determine the maximum points you can get.

2. The dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is not initialized or used correctly. The DP table should help in calculating the optimal score for each player, but the current implementation does not reflect this.

3. The logic inside the nested loops is flawed. The program uses `cards.count(j + 1)` inside the loops, which is inefficient and incorrect because it recalculates the count of each card in every iteration. Instead, a frequency dictionary or array should be used to keep track of the count of each card.

4. The base cases for the DP table are not correctly set up. The initial conditions for the DP table should reflect the starting state of the game.

5. The transitions in the DP table are not correctly defined. The transitions should consider the optimal moves for both players and update the scores accordingly.

To correctly solve this problem, a more robust approach would involve simulating the game with optimal strategies for both players or using a dynamic programming approach that accurately reflects the game's rules and state transitions.

Here is an example of a potential test case where the program does not work correctly:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might not produce the correct output due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
