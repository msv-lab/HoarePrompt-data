### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but seems to have incorrect logic.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
Let's carefully examine the logic in `func_2`:
```python
cnt = -1
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    x = n - (i * i - i)
    y = i * i
    cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
```
The formula used inside the loop:
- \( x = n - (i * i - i) \)
- \( y = i * i \)
- \( \text{cnt} = \text{cnt} + \text{math.ceil}(x / y) + (x \% y == 0) \)

This formula does not align with the problem's requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being directly checked. Instead, the code seems to be attempting to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\) using a non-intuitive formula.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

Here is a simple and correct way to implement the solution, which checks each pair \((a, b)\) directly:
```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2(n, m):
    return count_valid_pairs(n, m)
```

### Evaluation Using Annotations:
The annotated version of the code states:
- `cnt` is updated to the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.

This does not match the problem's requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
