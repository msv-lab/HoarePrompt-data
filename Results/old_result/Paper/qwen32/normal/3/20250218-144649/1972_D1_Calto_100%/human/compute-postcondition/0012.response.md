To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the changes made to the variables `cnt`, `x`, `y`, and `i`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6.
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / ((i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1))) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % ((i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1)) == 0)`
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`
- `y` is `i * i`
- `i` is `i + 1`

### Code to Execute:
```python
cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
```

### Impact Analysis:
- `x` and `y` are already defined in the initial state.
- The expression `math.ceil(x / y)` calculates the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
- The expression `(x % y == 0)` evaluates to `1` if `x` is perfectly divisible by `y`, otherwise `0`.
- `cnt` is updated by adding the results of the above two expressions to its current value.

### Output State Calculation:
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
- `x` and `y` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.
- `cnt` is updated to its new value based on the expression provided.

### Natural Language Description:
The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the ceiling of `x` divided by `y` and checking if `x` is perfectly divisible by `y` (which adds `1` if true, `0` otherwise). The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
