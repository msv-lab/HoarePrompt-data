You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8

Output

    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    return cnt
    #The program returns `cnt` which is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Let's break down the problem and the code to identify the issues.

### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but seems to have incorrect logic.

### Issues in `func_2`:
The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not properly count the valid pairs. The formula used inside the loop:
```python
x = n - (i * i - i)
y = i * i
cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
```
does not align with the problem's requirements. It seems to be an attempt to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\), but the formula is not derived from the problem's conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

### Example of Correct Implementation:
Here's a simple and correct way to implement the solution, which checks each pair \((a, b)\) directly:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2(n, m):
    return count_valid_pairs(n, m)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
