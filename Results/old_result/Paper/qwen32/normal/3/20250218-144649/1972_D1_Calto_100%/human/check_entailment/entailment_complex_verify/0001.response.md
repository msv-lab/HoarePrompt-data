### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program step-by-step using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Explanation

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotation correctly identifies this as the GCD function.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

#### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`

The function `func_2(n, m)` has the following code:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

Let's analyze this function in detail:
- `cnt` is initialized to `-1`. This is incorrect because we should start counting from `0`.
- The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y`:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
  - `y = i * i`
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The annotations provided do not correctly reflect the logic needed to solve the problem. The logic inside the loop does not seem to correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the conditions and the formula used do not match the problem statement.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check for each pair \((a, b)\) if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done with nested loops iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition.

Here is the correct implementation based on the problem statement:
```python
import math

def count_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_pairs(n, m))
```

#### Conclusion

Given the provided code, it does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

### Final: **False**
