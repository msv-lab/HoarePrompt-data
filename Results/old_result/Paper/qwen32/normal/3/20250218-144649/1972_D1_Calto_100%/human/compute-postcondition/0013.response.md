To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop evolves and how the variables `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are updated with each iteration. 

The given loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the updates:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt` starts at -1.
   - `n` and `m` are given positive integers.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `m`:
     - `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`.
     - `y` is calculated as `i * i`.
     - `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop runs `m` times.
   - After the loop finishes, `cnt` will have accumulated the sum of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.

To express the final state:
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `cnt` is updated after each iteration.

The final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `cnt` will be the sum of the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y` plus a boolean check if `x` is divisible by `y`, for each `i` from 1 to `m`.
