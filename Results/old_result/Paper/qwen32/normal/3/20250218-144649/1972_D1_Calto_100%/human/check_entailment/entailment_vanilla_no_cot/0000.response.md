Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the problem and the given solution to understand why.

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program includes two functions:
- `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but it does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem.

The logic in `func_2` is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula that does not correctly correlate to the problem's requirements.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_2(n, m))
```

This corrected program iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count. This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly.
