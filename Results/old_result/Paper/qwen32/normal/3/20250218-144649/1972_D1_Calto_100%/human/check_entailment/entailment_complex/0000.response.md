### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is correct as it implements the standard Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the problem statement.
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. It calculates a different expression that is not directly related to the problem of counting pairs (a, b) where a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
   - The expression `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` does not inherently relate to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

Given that `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.
