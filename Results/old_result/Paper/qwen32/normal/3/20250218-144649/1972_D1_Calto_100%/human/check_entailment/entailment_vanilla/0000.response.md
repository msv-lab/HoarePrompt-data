Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Mathematical Insight

For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can simplify the condition:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then we can write \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\), where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d \]
\[ a' + b' = k \cdot b' \cdot d \]

Since \(a' + b' = k \cdot b' \cdot d\), it implies that \(a' + b'\) must be divisible by \(b' \cdot d\). This condition is quite restrictive and can be used to count the valid pairs.

### Correctness of the Provided Program

Let's examine the provided code:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       while b:
           (a, b) = (b, a % b)
       return a
   ```
   This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   ```python
   def func_2(n, m):
       cnt = -1
       for i in range(1, m + 1):
           x = n - (i * i - i)
           y = i * i
           cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
       return cnt
   ```
   This function is not correct for the given problem. The logic inside the loop does not properly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

   The logic used in `func_2` seems to be trying to count something related to divisors and multiples, but it does not match the problem's requirement. Specifically, the variables `x` and `y` and their usage do not correctly implement the condition related to the GCD and the sum \(a + b\).

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: False**
