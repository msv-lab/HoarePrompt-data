### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used anywhere in the provided program.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

The implementation of `func_2` is as follows:
- It initializes `cnt` to -1.
- It iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The logic in `func_2` does not match the problem's requirement. The function does not correctly check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be implementing a different formula that does not correspond to the problem's conditions.

Given the mismatch between the problem statement and the provided function implementation, the program is incorrect.
