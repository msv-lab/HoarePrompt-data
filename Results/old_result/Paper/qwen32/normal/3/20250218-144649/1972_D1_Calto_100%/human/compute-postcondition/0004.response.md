The code snippet modifies the value of `cnt` based on the current values of `x` and `y`. `cnt` is initially -1. The new value of `cnt` is calculated as `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`. 

Here's the breakdown:
- `cnt` is incremented by `math.ceil(x / y)`, which is the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`.
- `cnt` is also incremented by `1` if `x % y == 0` (i.e., if `x` is divisible by `y` without a remainder).

The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0), `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`**.
