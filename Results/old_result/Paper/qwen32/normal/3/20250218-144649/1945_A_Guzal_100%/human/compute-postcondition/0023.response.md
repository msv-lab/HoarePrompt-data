The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the input, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
