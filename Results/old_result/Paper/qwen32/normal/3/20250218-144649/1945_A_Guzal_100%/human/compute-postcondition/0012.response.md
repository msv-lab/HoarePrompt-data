Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` is greater than 0. If `b` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `b % 3` and `c` is less than 3, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3; if the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3, then `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`.***
