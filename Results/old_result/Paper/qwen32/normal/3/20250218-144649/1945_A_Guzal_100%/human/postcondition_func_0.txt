The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates and prints a total count based on specific conditions involving the divisibility of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3. If the conditions are not met, it prints -1.
