The code snippet provided simply sets `k` to 0, and does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of `k` to 0.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
