The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `n`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The conditions provided (such as `b` not being divisible by 3 and the sum of `b % 3` and `c` being less than 3) do not affect the value printed by the `print` statement. The statement is hardcoded to print `-1`.

Output: **-1**
