Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is updated to be the sum of `a` and the integer division of the sum of `b` and `c` by 3.
