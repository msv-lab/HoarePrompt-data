The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`, overwriting its previous value. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**
