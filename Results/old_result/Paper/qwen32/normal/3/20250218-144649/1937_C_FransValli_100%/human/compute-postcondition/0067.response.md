Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is 0, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been explicitly set to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged from their initial state.
