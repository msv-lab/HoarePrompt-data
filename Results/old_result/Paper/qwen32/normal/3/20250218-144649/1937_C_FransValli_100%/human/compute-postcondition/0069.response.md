To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the information provided in the initial state and understand the roles of the variables `maxi`, `i`, and their relationships.

1. **maxi**: This variable holds the maximum index among those in the list `arr` that either received a response of `'='` or is the last index that received a `'<'` response. The exact value of `maxi` depends on the responses received during the execution of the program, but it is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to n-1.

2. **mini**: This variable holds the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`. However, `mini` is not directly used in the print statement, so its value is not relevant to this particular output.

3. **i**: The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context of the print statement, it appears to be used in a similar manner to `maxi`. Given that `maxi` is used twice in the print statement, it is reasonable to assume that `i` is also intended to be `maxi`. However, since `i` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its value with certainty from the provided information. For the sake of this problem, we'll assume `i` is intended to be `maxi` as per the pattern in the print statement.

Given these points, the print statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```
will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice and the value of `i` twice.

Since `maxi` and `i` are not explicitly given, the most precise description we can provide is based on their roles as described. Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is the maximum index among those in arr that received a '=' response or is the last index that received a '<' response, and i is assumed to be maxi)**
