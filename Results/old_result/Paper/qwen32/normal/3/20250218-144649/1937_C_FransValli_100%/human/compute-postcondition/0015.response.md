Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is greater than 5.
   - `res` is the value of the user input.
   - `maxi` is set to 4 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0.
   - `i` is 5.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `t` and `n`:**
   - The values of `t` and `n` are not directly relevant to the print statement, as they are not used in it.

2. **Value of `res`:**
   - `res` is the value of user input. The value of `res` will determine the value of `maxi`.

3. **Value of `maxi`:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 4.
   - If `res` is anything other than '<', then `maxi` remains 0.

4. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 5.

### Determining the Output:

- The print statement will always print the string `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice, then the value of `i` twice.
- Since `maxi` is determined by the user input `res`, we need to consider two cases:
  - **Case 1:** If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 4. The output will be `? 4 4 5 5`.
  - **Case 2:** If `res` is anything other than '<', then `maxi` is 0. The output will be `? 0 0 5 5`.

### Final Answer:

The output of the print statement depends on the value of `res`. However, based on the given initial state, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 5 5 (where maxi is 4 if res is '<', otherwise maxi is 0)**

Given the need for a precise description, we can present the output in the two possible cases:

- If `res` is '<':
  Output: **? 4 4 5 5**

- If `res` is anything other than '<':
  Output: **? 0 0 5 5**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, the most precise description is:

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 5 5 (where maxi is 4 if res is '<', otherwise maxi is 0)**
