The code snippet `res = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, or `arr`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `res` which holds the input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` is `[0]`, `res` is the input value.**
