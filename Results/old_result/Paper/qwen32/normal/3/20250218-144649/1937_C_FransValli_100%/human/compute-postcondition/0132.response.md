The code snippet `maxi = 0` sets the variable `maxi` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `mini`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer and must be at least `k + 1` where `k` is the current iteration count; `maxi` is 0; `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`; `arr` contains all indices `i` from `1` to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.**
