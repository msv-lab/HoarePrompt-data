The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received.
- `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.
- `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, or `arr` includes the new element `i` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged.
- `res` is the input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value `x`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, or `arr` includes the new element `i` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged, `res` is the input string, `i` is `x + 1`**
