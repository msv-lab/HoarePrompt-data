To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, `t` is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer that is at least 2. Again, `n` is not directly used in the print statement.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received.
4. **`mini`**: The smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. This variable is not used in the print statement.
5. **`arr`**: A list that is modified based on the value of `res` (`'<'`, `'='`, or neither).
6. **`i`**: An integer that is incremented by 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

- `'?'`: A literal string.
- `maxi`: The largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received.
- `arr[0]`: The first element of the list `arr`.
- `maxi`: The same value as the second argument in the print statement.
- `i`: The current value of `i`, which has been incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, then the first element of `arr`, then the value of `maxi` again, and finally the value of `i`.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where maxi is the largest index i for which the response was '<' or 0 if no such response was received, arr[0] is the first element of the list arr, and i is the current value of i)**

To make it more precise and in the required format:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where maxi is the largest index i for which the response was '<' or 0 if no such response was received, arr[0] is the first element of the list arr, and i is the incremented value of i)**
