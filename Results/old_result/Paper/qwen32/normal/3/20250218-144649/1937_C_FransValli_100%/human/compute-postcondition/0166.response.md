Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is modified to include the new element `i`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged. `res` is the input string, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
