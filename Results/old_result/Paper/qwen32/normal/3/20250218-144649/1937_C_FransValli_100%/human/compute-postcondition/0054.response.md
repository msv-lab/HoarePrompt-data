Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`.
- `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, and `arr` must have at least two elements.
- `mini` is `arr[0]`.
- `res` is the value of the input received.
- If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` is updated to the value of `item`. `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Determining the Values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`, which is explicitly defined as `arr[0]`.
- `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`, which means it is `arr[1]`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` (which is `arr[0]`), then `mini` again, then `item` (which is `arr[1]`), and finally `item` again.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] [arr[1]] [arr[1]] (where arr[0] is the first element of arr and arr[1] is the second element of arr)**

This description ensures that the output is precisely defined using the information provided in the initial state.
