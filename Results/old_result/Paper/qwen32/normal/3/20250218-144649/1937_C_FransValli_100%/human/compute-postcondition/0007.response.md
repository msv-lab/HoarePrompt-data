The provided code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `maxi`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`. Since the value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value after the assignment. Therefore, we can only state that `maxi` now holds the value of `i`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the value of `i`, `res` is the value of the user input, and the current value of `res` is `'<'`.**
