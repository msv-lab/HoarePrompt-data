Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, and `arr` must have at least two elements. If `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is set to `item` and `item` is updated to the next element in `arr[1:]`. Otherwise, `mini` and `item` remain unchanged.**
