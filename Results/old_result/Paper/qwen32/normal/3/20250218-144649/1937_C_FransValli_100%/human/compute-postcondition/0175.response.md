To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `arr` starts as `[0]`.
   - `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received.
   - `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the loop prints a query and reads a response.
   - If the response is `'<'`, `arr` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the response is `'='`, `arr` is updated to include `i`.
   - If the response is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `arr` remains unchanged.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all iterations, `arr` will contain all indices `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'='`.
   - `maxi` will be the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received.
   - `mini` will be the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` (though `mini` is not updated within the loop based on the provided code, it remains as per the initial condition).

Let's summarize the final state:
- `arr` will contain all indices `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'='`.
- `maxi` will be the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received.
- `mini` remains unchanged from its initial value.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` (unchanged), `arr` contains all indices `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'='`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `arr` will have all indices where the response was `'='`, `maxi` will reflect the largest index where the response was `'<'`, and `mini` will remain as it was initially.
