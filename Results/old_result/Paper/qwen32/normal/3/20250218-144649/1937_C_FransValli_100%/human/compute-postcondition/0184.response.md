Let's break down the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved in the `print` statement.

1. **`t`**: This is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. However, it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of this task.
2. **`n`**: This is at least 2, indicating that `arr` contains at least two elements.
3. **`maxi`**: This is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received. Again, `maxi` is not used in the `print` statement.
4. **`mini`**: This variable is set based on the response `res`. If `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is set to `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains `arr[0]`.
5. **`arr`**: This is a list containing at least two elements. The response was `'='` for at least one element, but the specific elements are not detailed.
6. **`item`**: This variable is set to `arr[2]`.

The `print` statement is:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we can deduce:
- `'?'` is a constant string.
- `mini` is either `arr[0]` or `arr[1]` depending on the response `res`.
- `item` is `arr[2]`.

Based on the information provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`, but we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is either arr[0] or arr[1] based on the response res, and item is arr[2])**
