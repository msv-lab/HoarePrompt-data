The code snippet `mini = arr[0]` assigns the value of the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. This changes the value of `mini` to be the first element of `arr`.

Given the initial state, the value of `mini` is updated to `arr[0]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and the elements of `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is `arr[0]`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'='`.**
