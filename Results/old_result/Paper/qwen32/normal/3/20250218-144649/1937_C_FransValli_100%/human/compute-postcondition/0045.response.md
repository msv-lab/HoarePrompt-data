To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (unchanged by the loop).
- `n` is the input integer, and the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`.
- `arr` is initialized to `[0]`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration:
- It prints a query and waits for a response.
- Depending on the response (`'<'` or `'='`), it updates `arr` and possibly `maxi`.

### Detailed Behavior:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `arr` starts as `[0]`.
   - `maxi` is precomputed and does not change during the loop.
   
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the loop checks the response to the query.
   - If the response is `'<'`, `arr` is set to `[i]`.
   - If the response is `'='`, `i` is appended to `arr`.
   - `maxi` is updated to `i` only if the response is `'<'`.

### Final Output State:

- After all iterations, `arr` will contain all indices `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) that received a response of `'='`.
- If at any point a response of `'<'` was received, `arr` will only contain the last such `i` that received `'<'`.

### Conclusion:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `maxi` remains unchanged.
- `arr` will contain the indices that received `'='` responses, or the last index that received a `'<'` response.

Given the nature of the loop, the final state of `arr` depends on the user inputs during each iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, and `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response.**
