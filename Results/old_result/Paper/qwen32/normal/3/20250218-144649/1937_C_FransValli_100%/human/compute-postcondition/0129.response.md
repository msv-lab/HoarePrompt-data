Let's break down the task using the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This is the size of the array or list being considered.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index \(i\) for which the response was `'<'`. This means that among all the indices where the response was `'<'`, `maxi` is the highest one.
4. **`mini`**: The smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. This means that among all the elements in `arr` where the response was `'>'`, `mini` is the smallest one.
5. **`arr`**: Contains all indices \(i\) from \(1\) to \(n-1\) for which the response was `'='`, or the last index \(i\) for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices \(i\) for which the response was `'='`.

### Print Statement:

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

### Interpretation:

- **`'!'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed.
- **`maxi`**: This is the largest index \(i\) for which the response was `'<'`.
- **`mini`**: This is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.

### Output Description:

Given the initial state, the print statement will output the following:
- The string `'!'`.
- The value of `maxi`, which is the largest index \(i\) where the response was `'<'`.
- The value of `mini`, which is the smallest element in `arr` where the response was `'>'`.

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `mini` are not provided, we describe them in terms of the conditions given.

### Final Output:

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the largest index i for which the response was '<', and mini is the smallest element in arr for which the response was '>')**
