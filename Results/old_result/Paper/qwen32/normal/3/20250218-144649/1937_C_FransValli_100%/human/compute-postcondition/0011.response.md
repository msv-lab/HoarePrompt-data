`res` is reassigned the value of the user input. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `i` remain unchanged. If the new value of `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` would be set to the value of `i` (which is 4) in subsequent code, but this assignment is not performed in the given snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the value of the user input, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 4**
