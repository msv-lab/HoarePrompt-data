The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `maxi`. Since `res` is `'<'`, the value of `maxi` will be updated to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i`, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is `'<'`.**
