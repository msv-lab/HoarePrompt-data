To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it prints a query and receives a response (`res`). If the response is `'<'`, it updates `maxi` to the current index `i`. If the response is not `'<'`, `maxi` remains unchanged.

Given this behavior, after all iterations, `maxi` will hold the highest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If no response was `'<'`, `maxi` will remain as its initial value, which is `0`.

The variable `mini` is described in the problem statement but is not directly updated in the loop body provided. Therefore, its value remains unchanged throughout the loop.

The variable `arr` is also described but not updated in the loop body, so its value remains unchanged as well.

The variable `t` and `n` are not modified within the loop and thus remain the same.

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop completes all its iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, `maxi` will be the largest index `i` for which the response to the query was `'<'`. If no such response was received, `maxi` will still be `0`. The values of `t`, `mini`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.**
