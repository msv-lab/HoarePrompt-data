The code snippet assigns the value of the first element of the array `arr` to the variable `mini`. Therefore, `mini` is updated to the value of `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` (unchanged from the initial state), `mini` is `arr[0]`, and `arr` contains all indices `i` from `1` to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.**
