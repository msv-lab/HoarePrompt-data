Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i`, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the new input value, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `maxi` is now set to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `mini`, `arr`, `res`, and the incremented value of `i`.
