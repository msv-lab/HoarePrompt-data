To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the roles of the variables involved:

1. **`maxi`**: This variable holds the value of `i` if the response `res` was `'<'`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. Given the context, `maxi` represents the largest index where a `'<'` response was received.

2. **`mini`**: This variable holds the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`. However, `mini` is not used in the print statement, so its value is not relevant for this task.

3. **`arr`**: This list contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response. This list is not directly used in the print statement, so its exact contents are not relevant for this task.

4. **`i`**: This is the current value of `i` after increment. It is used in the print statement.

5. **`res`**: This is the input string, which is not directly used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Given the roles of the variables, the output will be:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `maxi`: This is the largest index where a `'<'` response was received.
- `maxi`: This is repeated, so it will be the same value as the previous `maxi`.
- `i`: This is the current value of `i` after increment.
- `i`: This is repeated, so it will be the same value as the previous `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is the largest index where a '<' response was received, and i is the current value of i after increment)**
