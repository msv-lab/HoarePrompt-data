The code snippet `arr.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is now `[i]` if `res` was `'<'` and `i` was not previously in `arr`, `[0, i]` if `res` was `'='`, otherwise `[0, ...]` with `i` appended to the end, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
