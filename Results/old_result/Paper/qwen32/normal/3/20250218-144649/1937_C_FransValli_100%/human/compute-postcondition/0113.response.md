Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State and Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` (unchanged from the initial state).
- `mini` is `arr[0]`.
- `arr` must have at least two elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `mini` is explicitly defined as `arr[0]`. This means that `mini` holds the value of the first element of the list `arr`.
- `item` is not defined in the provided initial state or code snippet. Given the structure and common practices in competitive programming, `item` is likely a variable that holds a specific element from the list `arr` or is related to the comparison logic, but its exact value is not provided directly.

Since `item` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or the code snippet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can still describe the output in terms of the known values.

### Output:
The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by `mini` (which is `arr[0]`), followed by `mini` again, followed by `item`, followed by `item` again.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] [item] [item] (where arr[0] is the first element of the list arr and item is the value of item)**
