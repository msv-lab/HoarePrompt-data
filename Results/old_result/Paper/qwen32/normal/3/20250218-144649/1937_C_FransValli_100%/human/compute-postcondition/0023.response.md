The code snippet `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The initial state of the variables `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `res` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` is `[0]`, `res` is the value of the user input.**
