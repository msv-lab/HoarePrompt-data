The code snippet `arr = [i]` reassigns `arr` to a new list containing only the value of `i`. This means the previous contents of `arr` are discarded, and `arr` now holds a single-element list with `i` as its element.

Variables `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `res` is the value of the latest user input, `arr` is a list containing only the value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
