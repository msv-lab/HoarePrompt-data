Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. If `nums[i]` is less than the original value of `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000.**
