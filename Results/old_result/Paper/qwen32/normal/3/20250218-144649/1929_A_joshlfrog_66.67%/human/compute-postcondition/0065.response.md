Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[4]` if `nums[4]` is greater than the original `x`; otherwise, `x` remains 0, `y` is updated to `nums[4]` if `nums[4]` is less than the original `y`; otherwise, `y` remains unchanged, `i` is 4.**
