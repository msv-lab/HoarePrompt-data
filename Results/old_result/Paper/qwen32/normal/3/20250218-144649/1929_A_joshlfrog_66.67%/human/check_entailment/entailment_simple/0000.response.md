### Reasoning:
The program's goal is to determine the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (i.e., \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \)).

The provided program calculates the maximum beauty by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and then computing their difference (\( x - y \)). This approach isn't correct for the problem at hand.

To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending or descending order. The beauty of a sorted array in ascending order is the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which is equivalent to the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. However, the provided program only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values without considering the arrangement that maximizes the sum of all differences.

For example, consider the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \]

The provided program would simply output \( 100 - 43 = 57 \), which happens to be correct in this case but not because of the logic used. The logic would fail in other cases where the optimal arrangement isn't simply the difference between the max and min values.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for all possible cases. It only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the same as maximizing the sum of all consecutive differences.
