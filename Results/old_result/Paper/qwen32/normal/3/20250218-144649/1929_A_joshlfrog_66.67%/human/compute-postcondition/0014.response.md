The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `i` has already been incremented by 1, so `x` will take the value of the element at the new `i` index in the `nums` list. The values of `t`, `l`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]`.**
