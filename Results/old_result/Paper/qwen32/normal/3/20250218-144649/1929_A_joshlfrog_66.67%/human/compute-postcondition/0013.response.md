The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000, `i` is incremented by 1**  
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `i` is `i + 1`**
