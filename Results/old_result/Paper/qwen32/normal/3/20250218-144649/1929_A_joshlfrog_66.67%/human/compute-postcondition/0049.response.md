The only variable in the loop head is `e`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `e` and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `e` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `e` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `x` is the maximum value in `nums`; `y` is the minimum value in `nums`; `e` is `e + 1`**
