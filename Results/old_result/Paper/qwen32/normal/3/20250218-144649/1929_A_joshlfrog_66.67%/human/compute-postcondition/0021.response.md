The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` also remains unchanged unless the condition `nums[i] > x` was met prior to this line, which is not affected by the current line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x` (condition from previous state), then `x` is updated to `nums[i]` (condition from previous state). Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged. `y` is `nums[i]`.**
