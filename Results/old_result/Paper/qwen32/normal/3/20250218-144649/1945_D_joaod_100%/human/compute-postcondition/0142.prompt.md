Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. b is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum `total` when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: v is -1, total is 120, best is 50, c is incremented by 6, na_frente is 5, pos_final is 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], custo_pra_passar_b is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: v is -1, total is the sum of the smallest costs chosen at each step, best is the minimum cost found during the loop, c is 9, na_frente is na_frente - 1, pos_final is pos_final - 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is the list of integers provided by the input, custo_pra_passar_b is the list of integers provided by the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
