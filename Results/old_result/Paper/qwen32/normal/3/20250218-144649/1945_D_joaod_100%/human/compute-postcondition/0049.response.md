The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The values of `v`, `total`, `best`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum `total` when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input.**
