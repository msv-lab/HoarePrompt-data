Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach from position `m` to position 0, considering the costs specified in lists `a` and `b`.**
