Postcondition: **`v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is 9, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers provided by the input, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is now updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
