Output State: **`v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is either `sys.float_info.max` or the minimum between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `c` is 9, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the input.**

In simpler terms, `total` has been updated to include the cost of changing from `v` using `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
