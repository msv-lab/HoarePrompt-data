To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `v` is -1.
2. `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to `0`.
3. `best` is the minimum `total` when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.

### Variables and Conditions:
- `v` is explicitly given as -1.
- `total` is described as the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to `0`. However, the specific value of `total` is not provided directly.
- `best` is the minimum value of `total` when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`. Again, the exact value of `best` is not provided directly, but it is dependent on the value of `v` and `total` over some iteration or condition.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(best)
```

### Analysis:
- Since `v` is -1, and `best` is the minimum `total` when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`, the value of `best` would be determined based on the context of the loop or condition that updates `best` whenever `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
- However, without knowing the exact values of `total` at different points where `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `best`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(best)` statement will output the value of `best`, which is the minimum accumulated minimum cost (`total`) when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Therefore, the output will be described as:
Output: **best (where best is the minimum total when v was less than or equal to pos_final)**
