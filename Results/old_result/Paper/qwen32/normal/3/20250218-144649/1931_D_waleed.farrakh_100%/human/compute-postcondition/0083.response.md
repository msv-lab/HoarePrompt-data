Postcondition: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not include the key `(rx, ry)`; `count` remains 0 because `(current_pair, which is (a % x, a % y))` is not in `freq`; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `arr[0] % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**
