Reasoning:  
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it accurately computes the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs. It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` as it iterates through the array. For each element `a` in the array, it calculates the required remainders `rx` and `ry` that would make a pair with the current element `a` a beautiful pair. The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` and `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`. This can be transformed into checking if there exists a previous element `a_i` such that `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` matches `((-a_j % x + x) % x, a_j % y)`. If such a pair exists, it increments the count by the frequency of that pair. It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining the number of beautiful pairs. The use of the dictionary `freq` ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints (the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5).

The parsing and handling of input in `func_2` also appear to be correct based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
