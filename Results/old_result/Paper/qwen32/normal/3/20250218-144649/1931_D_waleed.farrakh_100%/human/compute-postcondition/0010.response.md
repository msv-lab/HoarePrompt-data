The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable (commonly used in Python when the loop variable is not needed), the only variable we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop has just completed one iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is 3; `n` is the first integer from `data[1]`; `x` is the second integer from `data[1]`; `y` is the third integer from `data[1]`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[2]` to integers.**

Since `t` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, to ensure the loop runs one more time, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1.
