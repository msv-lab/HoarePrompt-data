Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing three tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 5; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[5]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[6]` to integers.**

Natural language: The `test_cases` list now contains three tuples, with the third tuple being the same as the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` that were previously extracted from the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
