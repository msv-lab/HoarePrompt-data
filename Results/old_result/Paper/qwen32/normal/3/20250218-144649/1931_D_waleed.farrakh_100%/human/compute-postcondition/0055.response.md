Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the tuple `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) was in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is now added with a value of `1`. `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. `a` is the next element in `arr`.**
