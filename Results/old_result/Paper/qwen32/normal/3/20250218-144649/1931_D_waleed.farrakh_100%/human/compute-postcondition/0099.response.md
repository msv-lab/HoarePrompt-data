Postcondition: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, no change is made to `count`.**
