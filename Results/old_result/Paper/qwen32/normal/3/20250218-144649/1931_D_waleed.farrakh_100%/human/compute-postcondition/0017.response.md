The code snippet updates the `arr` variable by reading a new list of integers from `data[idx + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `idx` is 5, `arr` will be updated to the list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `data[6]` to integers.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 5; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[5]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[6]` to integers.**
