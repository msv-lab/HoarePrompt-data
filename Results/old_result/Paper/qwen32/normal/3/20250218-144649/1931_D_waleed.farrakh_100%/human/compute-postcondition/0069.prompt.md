Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the tuple `(rx, ry)`, and if `current_pair` was in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`; if `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is now added with a value of `1`. `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the tuple `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) was in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is now added with a value of `1`. `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. `a` is the next element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element). `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which has been incremented by `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` was in `freq`. `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the tuple `(rx, ry)`, and if `current_pair` was in `freq`, it is incremented by 1; otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with the value `1`. `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`. `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`. `a` is `a_next`, where `a_next` is the next element in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
