Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where the first tuple contains `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers with at least one element); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the tuple `(rx, ry)`; if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. The `current_pair` is in `freq`, and `count` has been updated to `count + freq[current_pair]`.**
