Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` contains the final count values for each tuple in the original `test_cases` list, `freq` is a dictionary that reflects the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in the last processed tuple's `arr`, and `count` is the final count for the last processed tuple.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are complete, the `test_cases` list will be empty because all tuples have been processed. The `results` list will contain the final count values for each tuple that was originally in `test_cases`. The `freq` dictionary will reflect the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in the last tuple's array `arr`. The `count` variable will hold the final count of pairs `(rx, ry)` for the last tuple processed.
