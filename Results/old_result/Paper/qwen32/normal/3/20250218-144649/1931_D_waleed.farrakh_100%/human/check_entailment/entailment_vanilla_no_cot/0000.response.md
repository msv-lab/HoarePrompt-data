To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description.

The program is composed of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

### `func_2` Analysis:
- This function is responsible for reading input and preparing the test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
- It correctly appends the test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
- It then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

### `func_1` Analysis:
- This function processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
- For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of tuples `(a % x, a % y)`.
- It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`.
- For each element, it calculates:
  - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which is equivalent to `(x - a % x) % x`. This is used to check the condition `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
  - `ry = a % y`.
- It checks if the tuple `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of this tuple to `count` because each occurrence of `(rx, ry)` represents a potential pair that meets the conditions.
- It then updates the frequency of the tuple `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

### Logic Verification:
- The logic for checking beautiful pairs is correct:
  - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` translates to `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` which simplifies to `a_i % x == (x - a_j % x) % x`.
  - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` translates to `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0` which simplifies to `a_i % y == a_j % y`.
- The program correctly identifies and counts pairs that meet these conditions using the frequency dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case as described in the problem.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
