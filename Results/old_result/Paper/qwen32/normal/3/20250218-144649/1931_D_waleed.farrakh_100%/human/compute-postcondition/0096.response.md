The code calculates the value of `rx` using the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`. This expression ensures that `rx` is the positive equivalent of `-a % x` modulo `x`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, and `freq` remain unchanged, and `a` is still the next element in `arr`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.**
