Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `j` is 1. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.**
