Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is the specific input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, and `i` is the total number of times `b[j] >= a[i]` was true during the loop.**

In simple terms, the variable `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values.
