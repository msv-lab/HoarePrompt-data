Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is 1, `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
