The code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `cnt` is 0.**
