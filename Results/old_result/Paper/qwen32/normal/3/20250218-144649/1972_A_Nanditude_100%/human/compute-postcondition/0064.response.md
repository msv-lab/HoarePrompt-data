Postcondition: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, or `i` is 1 or 3 if `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, and `j` is 2.**
