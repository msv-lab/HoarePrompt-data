The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `cnt` is 0; `i` is 0.
