The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of problems. This is followed by two lines: the first line contains a sorted list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and the second line contains a sorted list b of n integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), representing the expected maximum difficulties of the problems.
