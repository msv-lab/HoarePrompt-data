The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and the condition `b[j] < a[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `cnt` is 1; `i` is 0; `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.**
