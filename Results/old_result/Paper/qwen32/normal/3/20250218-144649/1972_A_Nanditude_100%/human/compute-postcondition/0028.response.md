The value of `i` is set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0.**
