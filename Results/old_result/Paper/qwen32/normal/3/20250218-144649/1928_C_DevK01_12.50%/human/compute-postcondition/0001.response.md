The provided code attempts to calculate the square root of the list `q` using `math.sqrt(q)`. However, `math.sqrt()` expects a single number, not a list of tuples. This will result in a `TypeError`. Since the code will raise an error, the values of `q` and `M` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list. The code raises a TypeError.**
