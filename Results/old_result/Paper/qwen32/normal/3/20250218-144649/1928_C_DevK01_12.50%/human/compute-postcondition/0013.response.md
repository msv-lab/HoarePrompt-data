Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. If the first element of the first tuple in `q` (which is `n`) is divisible by `i`, `M` also contains `i` and the result of `q[0][0] // i` if `q[0][0] // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Additionally, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains `i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**
