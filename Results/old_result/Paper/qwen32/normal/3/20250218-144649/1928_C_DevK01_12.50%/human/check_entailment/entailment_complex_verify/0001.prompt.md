You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and x, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and q contains between 1 and 100 tuples.

If `w` does not satisfy these conditions, `M` remains an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The function returns a list `M` that includes the integer `w` (the square root of the maximum `n` from all tuples in `q` if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1` for any tuple). For each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, the function includes all integers `i` and `n // i` in the list `M` such that both `i` and `n // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to determine the number of possible values of `k` for which, in a sequence that repeats every `2k-2` positions, Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x`. The sequence starts with `1, 2, ..., k`, then `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`, and repeats.

### Key Observations:
1. The sequence repeats every `2k-2` positions. 
2. For a given `k`, the sequence within one cycle is `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
3. For a position `n`, we need to determine if there exists a `k` such that the number at position `n` is `x`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to find the possible values of `k` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**: It checks if `n + x` is even. This is because the sequence length `2k-2` must be even, and `n + x` being even ensures that `n` and `x` can fit within such a sequence.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - It defines a helper function `func_1` which finds divisors of a given number `q` that are at least `x-1`.
   - It calculates `q = (n + x - 2) / 2` and finds divisors of `q` that are at least `x-1` (these potential `k` values).
   - If `n >= 3x - 2`, it also calculates another `q = (n - x) / 2` and finds divisors of this `q` that are at least `x-1`.

4. **Combining Results**: It combines the results from the two sets of divisors, removes duplicates, and counts the number of unique `k` values.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program uses the correct mathematical approach to find possible `k` values by leveraging the periodicity and the properties of divisors.
- It correctly handles the condition that `n + x` must be even.
- It accounts for both possible sequences (increasing and decreasing) within the cycle.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly determine the number of possible `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
