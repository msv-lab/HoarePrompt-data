The code snippet initializes an empty list `M`. The initial state of `q` remains unchanged as it is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` with the constraints `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list.**
