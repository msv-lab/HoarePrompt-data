The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 4, this means that the list `M` will now contain the integer `w` followed by the integer `4`.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integers `w` and `4`. `i` is 4, and `w` must be greater than 4.**
