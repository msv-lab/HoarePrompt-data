### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`, the described "settling" pattern holds true.

The provided program seems to follow a structured approach to solve this problem:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` (position) and `x` (number received).
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if `n + x` is odd. If it is, it immediately prints `0` because the pattern described in the problem requires `n + x` to be even.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to find all possible values of `k` that fit the criteria. It calculates `w` as the square root of `(y - 2) // 2` and checks if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`. If so, it adds `w` to the list `M`. Then, it iterates from `1` to `w // 1` to find all divisors of `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2`) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds them to `M`.
4. **Handling Larger `n`**: If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calculates another set of possible `k` values using `func_1` with `(n - x) // 2` and adds them to `M`.
5. **Removing Duplicates**: It removes duplicates from `M` and prints the length of `M`, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

However, there are some issues with the provided code:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to take two arguments (`q` and `x`), but it is being called with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`, which seems correct. However, the description of `func_1` states that `q` is a list of tuples, which is not the case here.
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be incorrect. The function is supposed to find all possible `k` values that fit the criteria, but the current implementation does not seem to correctly account for the repeating pattern described in the problem.
- The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where `n >= 3 * x - 2`.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues and the fact that the function `func_1` does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to find all possible `k` values, the provided program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
