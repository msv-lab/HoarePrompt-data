### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the number of valid `k` values that fit the given constraints for each test case. The logic in the program is based on the observation that the pattern of positions repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the number `x` Vasya received can be used to deduce possible values of `k`.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case, which consists of two integers `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received).

2. **Initial Check**: For each test case, the program checks if `y = n + x` is odd. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because it is impossible for `k` to satisfy the conditions (since the pattern length `2k - 2` must be even).

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to find possible `k` values based on the equation `y = 2k - 2`, which simplifies to `k = (y + 2) / 2`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the program also calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional possible `k` values based on another part of the pattern.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates possible values of `k` by considering divisors of `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`).
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It also checks all divisors `i` of `q` to see if they or their complements `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of unique `k` values found for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**: The approach of using divisors and the square root to find possible `k` values is sound. The conditions checked in `func_1` ensure that only valid `k` values are considered.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles cases where `n + x` is odd by immediately returning `0`. It also considers the additional condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` to find more possible `k` values.
- **Efficiency**: The use of divisors and the square root check ensures that the program is efficient even for large values of `n` and `x` up to \(10^9\).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
