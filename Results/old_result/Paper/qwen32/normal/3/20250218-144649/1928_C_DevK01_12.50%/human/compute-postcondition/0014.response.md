The only variable in the loop head is `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, as the loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to, but not including, `int(w // 1)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
- `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. It may also contain `i` and the result of `q[0][0] // i` if `q[0][0] // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Additionally, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains `i`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1.** 

However, to be more precise, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can express the state as:

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1.** 

To make it clear, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 2. If `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3, and so on.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1.** 

For the sake of clarity in the format requested:

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1.** 

If we need to be more specific about the value of `i`, we can denote it as `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Since we do not have `i_prev`, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1.** 

For the final answer:

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
