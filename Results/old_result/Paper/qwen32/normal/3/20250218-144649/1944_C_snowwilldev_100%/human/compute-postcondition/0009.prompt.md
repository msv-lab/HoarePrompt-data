Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`) representing the elements of the array `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    cnt[a[i]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
