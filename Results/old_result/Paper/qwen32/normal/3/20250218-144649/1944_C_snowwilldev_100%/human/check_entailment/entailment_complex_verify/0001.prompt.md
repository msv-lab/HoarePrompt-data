You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `N` iterations have completed, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt` contains the frequency of each element in the array `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: N.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`. It calculates the frequency of each element in the array and returns the smallest integer `i` such that the frequency of `i` in the array is either 1 or 0, or it returns 2 if there are at least two unique elements with a frequency of 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and manipulating an array `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations

1. **Turns and Moves**:
   - Alice starts and picks an element, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element and removes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **MEX and Strategy**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
   - For Alice to maximize the MEX, she should aim to include as many lower numbers as possible in `c` while ensuring the MEX is as large as possible.
   - Bob will try to prevent this by strategically removing elements that Alice might have chosen.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

#### Explanation of the Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `tc` is read.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The array `a` is read.
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.

3. **Calculating MEX**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to 0.
   - The code iterates over the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, if `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments `t`.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the function returns `i`.

#### Correctness of the Code

The code attempts to determine the MEX by counting the occurrences of each element and checking when the conditions for the MEX are met. However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed:

- The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` is not correctly capturing the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, which is not accurately determined by this logic.
- The code does not account for the optimal play strategy of Alice and Bob. It simply counts occurrences and checks conditions, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX under optimal play.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
