The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the dictionary `cnt`. Given the initial state, `N` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1. This means `a[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

The output state will reflect that the count of `a[1]` in the dictionary `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.**
