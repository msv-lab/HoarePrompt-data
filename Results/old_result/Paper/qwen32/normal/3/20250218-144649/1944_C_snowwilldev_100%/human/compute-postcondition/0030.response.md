Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`. It calculates the frequency of each element in the array and returns the smallest integer `i` such that the frequency of `i` in the array is either 1 or 0, or it returns 2 if there are at least two unique elements with a frequency of 1.**
