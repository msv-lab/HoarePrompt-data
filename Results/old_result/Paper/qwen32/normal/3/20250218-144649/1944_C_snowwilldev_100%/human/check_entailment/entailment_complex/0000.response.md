### Reasoning:

The given code seems to be incomplete and not correctly implementing the logic to determine the optimal game score based on the rules provided. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and the expected solution:

1. **Objective**: Alice and Bob are playing a game where Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them from `a` (Bob).
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The final score is the MEX of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to include as many consecutive integers starting from 0 in `c` as possible.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from doing so by removing elements that Alice would otherwise pick.

4. **Key Insight**:
   - If there are at least two unique elements with a frequency of 1 in the array `a`, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 2.
   - If there are no elements with a frequency of 1, the MEX will be determined by the smallest integer that is missing from the array.

### Analysis of the Code:

The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. Here are the issues:

- **Counting Elements**: The code correctly counts the frequency of each element in the array `a`.
- **Checking Conditions**: The code checks if there are at least two unique elements with a frequency of 1 or if an element is missing (frequency of 0). However, it does not correctly simulate the game turns and the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation would involve simulating the game turns and keeping track of the elements that Alice can add to `c` while Bob removes elements. Here's a possible correct approach:

1. Count the frequency of each element.
2. Determine the smallest integer `i` such that either:
   - `i` is missing from the array (frequency of `i` is 0).
   - There are at least two unique elements with a frequency of 1, in which case the MEX is at least 2.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the optimal score. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
