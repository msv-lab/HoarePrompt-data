The code snippet `t += 1` increments the value of the variable `t` by 1. The other variables (`N`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **N must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` contains the frequency of each element in the array `a`, `t` is 1, and the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is 1.**
