The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with `int` as the default factory. This means that any key accessed in `cnt` will have a default value of `0` if it does not already exist.

Given the initial state, the value of `N` (the number of test cases) and the arrays `a` for each test case are not affected by the code snippet. The only new variable introduced is `cnt`, which is a `defaultdict` initialized to store integer counts.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`) representing the elements of the array `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `cnt` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
