Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. Additionally, `b` is greater than `a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the current value of `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `b - a` is less than `n`.**
