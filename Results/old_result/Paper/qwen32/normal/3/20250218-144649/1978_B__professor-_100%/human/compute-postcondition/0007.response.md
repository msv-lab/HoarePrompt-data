To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given formula in the `print` statement: `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - `t`: An input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
   - `a`: An integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
   - `b`: An integer between 1 and \(10^9\) and is greater than `a`.
   - The condition `b - a >= n` must be satisfied.

2. **Formula Breakdown:**
   - The formula inside the `int` function is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
   - Let's break this down:
     - `2 * b`: This is simply twice the value of `b`.
     - `2 * b - n + 1`: This adjusts the value by subtracting `n` and adding 1.
     - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the adjusted value by `n`.
     - `// 2`: This performs integer division by 2, effectively dividing the result by 2 and discarding any remainder.

3. **Interpreting the Formula:**
   - The formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` can be seen as a way to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - Specifically, it calculates the sum of the series starting from `b - n + 1` to `b`.

### Explanation of the Series:
- The series starts at `b - n + 1` and ends at `b`.
- The number of terms in this series is `n`.
- The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})\).
- Here, the first term is `b - n + 1` and the last term is `b`.
- Plugging these into the formula, we get: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times ((b - n + 1) + b) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)\).
- This matches our given formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - n + 1` to `b`.

Output: **The sum of the arithmetic series from \(b - n + 1\) to \(b\) (where \(b\) is greater than \(a\) and \(b - a \geq n\))**
