### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to compute the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling `n` buns under the given promotional conditions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit Calculation**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price of the first bun (`b`) is less than or equal to the usual price (`a`), it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling any bun at a modified price would yield less or equal profit.
     - The total profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price of the first bun and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns, it's optimal to sell all buns at the modified prices.
     - The total profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`, which is calculated as `((2 * b - n + 1) * n) // 2`.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is less than the number of buns, it's optimal to sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
     - The optimal `k` in this case is `b - a` because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would start yielding less profit than selling at the usual price.
     - The total profit in this case is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `a + 1`, plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - This is calculated as `((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2) + (a * n)`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `b <= a` by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - It correctly handles cases where `b - a >= n` by selling all buns at the modified prices.
   - It correctly handles cases where `b - a < n` by selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified prices and the remaining buns at the usual price.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit for each test case based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases appropriately and efficiently computes the results.

**Correctness: True**
