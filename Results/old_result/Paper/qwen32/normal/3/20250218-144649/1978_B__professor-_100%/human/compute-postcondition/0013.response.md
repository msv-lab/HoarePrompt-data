The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state of these variables is not specified, but after the code execution, their values will be the integers provided as input.

The impact of the code on the program is that it updates the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` based on the input. The value of `_` is mentioned to be incremented by 1, but since `_` is not defined in the provided code snippet, it is assumed that this part of the description is not relevant to the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.**
