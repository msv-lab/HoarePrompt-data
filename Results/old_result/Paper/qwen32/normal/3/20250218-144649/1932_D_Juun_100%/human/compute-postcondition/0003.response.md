Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list; `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit); the third line (2n card strings) is still available for reading; `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the initialization of the `answers` list, which is set to an empty list. Other variables (`trumps`, `trump`, and the third line of input) remain unchanged.
