The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables; it merely changes the flow of the loop. Given that the `continue` statement does not alter any variables, the values of `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `suit`, and `rank` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` is either `['2', '4', '6', '7']` or `['2', '4', '6']`, `answers` is either `['3C 5C']` or `['3C 5C', '8D 7D']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`, `suit` is `'H'`, and `rank` is `None`**.
