Postcondition: **`trumps` is either `['2', '4', '6']` or `['2', '4']`. `answers` is either `['3C 5C', '8D 7D', 'NoneH 7']`, `['3C 5C', '8D 7D', 'NoneH 6']`, `['3C 5C', 'NoneH 7']`, or `['3C 5C', 'NoneH 6']`. `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`. `suit` is `'H'`. `rank` is `None`. If `trumps` was originally `['2', '4', '6', '7']`, then `trumps` is updated to either `['2', '4', '6']` or `['2', '4']` and `answers` is updated accordingly. If `trumps` was originally `[]`, the program returns `None`.**
