The code appends the value of `rank` to the `trumps` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`; `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit); `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}`; `rank` is the rank part of the `card` string; `suit` is the suit part of the `card` string; the current value of `suit` is equal to `trump`.**
