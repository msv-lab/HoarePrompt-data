Postcondition: **`rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` followed by `rank`. Otherwise, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` if `suit` equals `trump`, otherwise it is an empty list. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list containing one or more strings ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]). If `suits[suit]` is `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`, and `answers` is a list containing one string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]). If `suit` equals `trump`, `answers` is an empty list.**
