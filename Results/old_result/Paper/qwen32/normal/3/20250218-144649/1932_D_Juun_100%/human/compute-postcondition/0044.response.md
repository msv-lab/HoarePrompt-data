Output State: **`trumps` is `['2', '4', '6', '7']`, `answers` is `['3C 5C']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`, `suit` is `'D'`, `rank` is `'8'`, and `trumps` is not an empty list.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
