Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is the final accumulated value after processing all elements in `arr`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the current test case with `arr` fully processed; `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as tuples `(num % x, num % y)` and values as the counts of how many times each residue pair was encountered. The `results` list now includes the final value of `count` from the current test case.`**

Natural Language Description: The `results` list now includes the final value of `count` from the current test case. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
