Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is updated by adding the value retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If `(r_x, r_y)` is not found in `residue_map`, it defaults to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
