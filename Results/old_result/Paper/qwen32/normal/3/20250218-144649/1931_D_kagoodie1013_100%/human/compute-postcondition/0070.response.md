Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that has been fully iterated over; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each test case in `test_cases`; `count` is not defined outside the loop as it is local to each iteration; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the last test case processed with `arr` fully processed; `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each pair `(num % x, num % y)` encountered in the last `arr`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `test_cases` will have been completely processed. For each test case, the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been seen before is calculated and stored in the `results` list. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will hold the values from the last test case that was processed, and `residue_map` will reflect the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in that last test case's array `arr`. The variable `count`, which is local to each iteration of the loop, will not be defined outside the loop after all iterations are complete.
