The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable with the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided code. Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is updated to `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least two elements, `residue_map` is updated with `current_key` incremented by 1, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, the `current_key` is now set to the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
