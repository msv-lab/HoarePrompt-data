Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is updated to `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one more element; `residue_map` is updated with `current_key` incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In simple terms, the variable `r_y` is updated to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
