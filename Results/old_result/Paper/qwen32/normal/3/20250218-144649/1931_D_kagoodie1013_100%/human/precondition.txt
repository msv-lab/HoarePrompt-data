test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, and two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) representing Polycarp's favorite integers. Following these integers in the tuple is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
