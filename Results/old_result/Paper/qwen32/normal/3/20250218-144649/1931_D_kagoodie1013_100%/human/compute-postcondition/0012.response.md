The code snippet `r_y = num % y` updates the value of `r_y` by calculating the modulus of `num` with `y`. 

The previous value of `r_y` was `arr[0] % y`, but now it is updated to `num % y`. Since `num` is `arr[1]`, the new value of `r_y` is `arr[1] % y`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two integers; `r_x` is `-arr[1] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[1] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1}`; `num` is `arr[1]`.**
