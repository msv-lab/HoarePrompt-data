The code snippet provided updates the value of `r_y` based on the current `num` and `y`. 

Given the initial state, `num` is the next element in `arr`, and `y` is a predefined value. The new value of `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least two elements, `residue_map` is updated with `current_key` incremented by 1, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In natural language: The output state maintains all the previous conditions and values except for `r_y`, which is now updated to be the result of `num % y`.
