### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- A pair of indices \((i, j)\) is considered "beautiful" if:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Approach:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input and organizes it into a list of test cases.
   - Each test case consists of the number of elements \(n\), the integers \(x\) and \(y\), and the array \(a\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` to zero and a `residue_map` to store the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - For each element in the array:
     - It calculates the residues \(r_x = -a_i \% x\) and \(r_y = a_i \% y\).
     - It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it increments the `count` by the frequency of that pair.
     - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the counts for each test case.

#### Verification:
- **Condition 1:** \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
  - This is equivalent to \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
  - The program calculates \(r_x = -a_i \% x\), which is the same as \(-a_i \pmod{x}\).

- **Condition 2:** \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)
  - This is equivalent to \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
  - The program calculates \(r_y = a_i \% y\).

- **Counting Pairs:**
  - The program uses a dictionary to keep track of how many times each pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) has been seen.
  - For each element, it checks if the complementary pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before, which ensures both conditions are met.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
