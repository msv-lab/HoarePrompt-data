The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` calculates the value of `-num % x` and assigns it to the variable `r_x`. The values of `num` and `x` are not specified in the initial state, so we will keep them as they are in the output state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is 0; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-num % x`.**
