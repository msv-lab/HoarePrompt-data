Output State: **`n` is `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 2, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**

Natural language: The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
