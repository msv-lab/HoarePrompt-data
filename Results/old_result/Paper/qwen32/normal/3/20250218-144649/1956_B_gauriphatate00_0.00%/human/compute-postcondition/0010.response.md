Output State: **`n` is `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the value of `idx` has been updated to `2 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
