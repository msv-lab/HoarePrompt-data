To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior and the variables involved in the loop. The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each result. The provided output states for the first 3 iterations indicate that the `results` list contains at least one, two, and three elements respectively after these iterations. This implies that the loop continues to execute until all elements in the `results` list are printed.

Given that the number of iterations is determined by the length of the `results` list, the loop will execute exactly as many times as there are elements in `results`. Therefore, the final output state will be when all elements in `results` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the value of `n` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `1 + sum(n_i + 1 for i in range(t))`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing all the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, and the loop has printed all elements in `results`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have printed each element in the `results` list, and the state of the variables will remain as described, with `results` containing all the computed results from each iteration.
