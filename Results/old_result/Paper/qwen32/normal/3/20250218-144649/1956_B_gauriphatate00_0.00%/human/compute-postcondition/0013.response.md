The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of the string at the `idx` position in the `data` list. This does not affect the other variables directly, but it changes the value of `n`, which could impact any subsequent calculations or operations that depend on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is now the integer value of the string at position `idx` in the `data` list, while all other variables retain their previous values.
