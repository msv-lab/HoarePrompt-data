The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its current value, but it must still be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is already decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `t` decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

Since `t` is already `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

To make it clear, if `t` was 5 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 4 at the end of the previous iteration, and for the loop to continue, `t` should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. 

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

But to be specific about the change in `t`:

State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

Since `t` is already `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we just need to ensure it is still greater than 0:

State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**
