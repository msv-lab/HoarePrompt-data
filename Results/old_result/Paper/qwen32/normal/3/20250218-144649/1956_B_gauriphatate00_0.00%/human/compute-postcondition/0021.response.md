The code snippet updates the list `a` by mapping the integers from a slice of `data` starting at `idx` and of length `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

In simpler terms, the list `a` now contains `n` integers from the slice `data[idx:idx + n]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
