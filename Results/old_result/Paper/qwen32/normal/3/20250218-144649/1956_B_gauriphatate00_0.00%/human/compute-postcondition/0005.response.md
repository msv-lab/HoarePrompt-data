The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `results`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`) remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 1, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is an empty list.**
