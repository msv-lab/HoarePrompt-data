Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

Explanation: The value of `n` has been updated to `int(data[idx])`. All other variables (`a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
