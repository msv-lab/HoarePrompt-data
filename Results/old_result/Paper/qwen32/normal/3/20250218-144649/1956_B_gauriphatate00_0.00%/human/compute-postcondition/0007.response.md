The value of `n` is updated to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. Given that `idx` is 1, `n` is now equal to `int(data[1])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 1, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
