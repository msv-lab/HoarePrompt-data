Output State: **`n` is `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**

In simple terms, the value of `results` has been updated to include the result of the function `func_1(n, a)`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t`) retain their initial values.
