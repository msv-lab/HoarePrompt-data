### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get when playing a card game optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

The key observation here is that you can only score points if you play a card with a number that is already on the table. Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to minimize your points, which means she will try to avoid placing cards that would allow you to score points, or if she has to, she will place them in a way that minimizes your scoring opportunities.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` (your cards) and returns the minimum of this count and `n // 2`. This is based on the idea that you can score a point for each pair of cards that you have, but you can only play up to `n` cards, so the maximum number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you get.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
- **Pairs Calculation**: `pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))` counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand. These are the potential points you can score.
- **Result Calculation**: `return min(pairs, n // 2)` ensures that you do not score more points than the number of turns you have, which is `n`.

The function `func_2` handles input parsing and output generation. It reads multiple test cases, processes each one using `func_1`, and prints the result.

### Verification:
Let's verify the provided examples:
1. **First Example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `a = [1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Pairs: `1` (only `1` appears twice)
   - Result: `min(1, 4 // 2) = 1`
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Second Example**:
   - `n = 8`
   - `a = [7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]`
   - Pairs: `3` (`8` and `5` appear twice each)
   - Result: `min(3, 8 // 2) = 4`
   - However, the correct output is `2`, which suggests that the function is not considering Nene's optimal play correctly in this example. The function `func_1` only considers the number of pairs and the number of turns, but it does not take into account the strategic play by Nene.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not fully account for Nene's optimal play, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
