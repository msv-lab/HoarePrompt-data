The provided code snippet only initializes the variable `idx` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 0.**
