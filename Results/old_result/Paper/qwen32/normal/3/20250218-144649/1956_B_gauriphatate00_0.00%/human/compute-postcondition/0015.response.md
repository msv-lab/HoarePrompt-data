The code snippet provided updates the list `a` by mapping the elements from `data[idx:idx + n]` to integers. This means the list `a` will now contain integers derived from the slice of `data` starting at `idx` and of length `n`.

Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as `int(data[idx])` and `idx` is `3 + n`. Therefore, the new values of the list `a` will be derived from the slice `data[idx:idx + n]` and converted to integers.

The other variables (`data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**.
