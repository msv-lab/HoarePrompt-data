You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in the list are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in the list that are not equal to the first element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here is a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`cnt`) and then prints this value as the answer, which is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition, not the length of the longest sequence of identical elements.
   - For example, consider the input array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The longest sequence of identical elements is `3` with a count of `5`. However, to make the array stop being beautiful, we need to remove `3` elements (the three `5`'s or any three `3`'s that are not part of a sequence that can be reduced to a single element).

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`. However, the logic is not robust for other cases.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be broken into multiple segments that can be reduced independently. For instance, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program incorrectly outputs `1` when the correct answer is `1` (removing any `2`), but the logic is flawed for more complex cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `1`. However, this is not a strong counterexample to show the incorrectness. A stronger counterexample would be:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program outputs `3`, but the correct output should be `3` (removing the three `3`'s surrounding the `5`).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one needs to identify the segments of the array that can be reduced to a single element and calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. This involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated approach to track and merge segments.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle the problem description correctly for all cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
