The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements not equal to `val` found during the loop, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence is found, and `cnt` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements starting from `arr[0]` that are equal to `val`. After executing the code, `ans` will be the smaller of these two values.

Output State: **`flag` is True; `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements starting from `arr[0]` that are equal to `val`; `i` is `n-1`.**
