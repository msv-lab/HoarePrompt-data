Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `flag` is False, `i` is 1, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `flag` has been changed to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
