The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `flag` is True
- `val` is `arr[0]`
- `cnt` is 1 if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `ans` is `0`

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. If `arr[0]` equals `val`:
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `ans` is initially `Decimal('Infinity')`
   - `ans = min(ans, cnt)` results in `ans` being updated to `1`.

2. If `arr[0]` does not equal `val`:
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `ans` is initially `0`
   - `ans = min(ans, cnt)` results in `ans` remaining `0` because `min(0, 0)` is `0`.

Output State: **`flag` is True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 1 if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is 1 if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0**.
