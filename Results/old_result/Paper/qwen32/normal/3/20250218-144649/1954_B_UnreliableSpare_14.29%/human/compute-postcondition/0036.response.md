The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`flag`, `ans`, `val`, `cnt`, and `i`), but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. 

Here's the breakdown of the variables mentioned in the initial state:
- `flag` is set to `True`.
- `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- `val` is set to the first element of the list `arr`.
- `cnt` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements starting from `arr[0]` that are equal to `val`.
- `i` is set to `n-1`, where `n` is presumably the length of the list `arr`.

Despite these variable definitions, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not use any of these variables. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1**
