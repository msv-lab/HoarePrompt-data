To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and understand the relationships between the variables:

1. **`flag` is False**: This indicates a boolean variable `flag` is set to `False`, but it is not directly used in the print statement.

2. **`ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`**: This suggests that `ans` is being updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. However, we don't have the initial value of `ans` before this update, so we can't determine its exact value just yet.

3. **`val` is `arr[0]`**: This means `val` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`.

4. **`cnt` is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements starting from `arr[0]` that are equal to `val`**: This means `cnt` counts how many consecutive elements starting from the first element of `arr` are equal to `val`.

5. **`i` is `n-1`**: This sets `i` to the last index of the list `arr` (assuming `n` is the length of `arr`), but `i` is not used in the print statement.

Given the print statement `print(ans)`, we need to determine the value of `ans` based on the information provided. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we can't determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact numerical value of `ans`, we can describe `ans` in terms of `cnt` and its previous value.

**Output: ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements starting from arr[0] that are equal to arr[0])**
