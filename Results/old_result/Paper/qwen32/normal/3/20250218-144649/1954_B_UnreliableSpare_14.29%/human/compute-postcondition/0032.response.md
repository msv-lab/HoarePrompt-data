Postcondition: **`flag` is True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 3 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` equals `val` and `arr[2]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 2 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` equals `val` or `arr[2]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[0]` equals `val`, otherwise `ans` is `min(ans, cnt)` if `arr[2]` does not equal `val`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` does not equal `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
