The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range it iterates over (which is defined by `n`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `i` is 2**
