Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is an even integer.
- The current value of `a` and `b` satisfies the condition 2 * a < b.

The task is to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * n)`.

**Analysis:**
- The value of `a` is an integer.
- The value of `n` is an even integer.
- The condition `2 * a < b` is satisfied, but this condition does not affect the calculation of `a * n` directly.

The `print(a * n)` statement will output the product of `a` and `n`. Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output Description:**
The code prints the product of `a` and `n`. Since `n` is specified to be an even integer and `a` is an integer, the output will be an integer that is the result of multiplying `a` by `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer and n is an even integer)**
