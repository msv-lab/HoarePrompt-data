Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. He can buy them either individually at `a` burles each or in pairs at `b` burles for two yogurts. The goal is to determine the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations
1. If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible.
2. If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible and then buy one additional yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Odd `n`:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2` is not zero), the program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) is less than the cost of buying them in a promotion (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it buys all `n` yogurts individually, which costs `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys `n // 2` pairs of yogurts for `b` burles each and buys the remaining yogurt individually for `a` burles, which costs `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Logic for Even `n`:**
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2` is zero), the program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) is less than the cost of buying them in a promotion (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it buys all `n` yogurts individually, which costs `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys `n // 2` pairs of yogurts for `b` burles each, which costs `n // 2 * b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * 5 < 9` (which is false). Therefore, it buys 1 pair for `9` burles.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * 5 < 9` (which is false). Therefore, it buys 1 pair for `9` burles and 1 yogurt individually for `5` burles.
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * 5 < 11` (which is true). Therefore, it buys all 3 yogurts individually for `15` burles.
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * 5 < 11` (which is true). Therefore, it buys all 4 yogurts individually for `20` burles.
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
