The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute `int(input())` times, which means the loop will run `t` times where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since the loop head only contains `_`, and `_` does not retain any state between iterations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations left. However, since `_` does not store any information about the iteration count, we can infer that the loop will execute one more time if `t` is decremented by 1.

Given that `t` represents the number of iterations left, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
