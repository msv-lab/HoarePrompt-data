### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and `b` for two yogurts under promotion.
- **Constraints**:
  - Number of test cases, `t`: \(1 \le t \le 10^4\)
  - Number of yogurts, `n`: \(1 \le n \le 100\)
  - Price for one yogurt, `a`: \(1 \le a \le 30\)
  - Price for two yogurts on promotion, `b`: \(1 \le b \le 30\)

#### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

#### Annotated Code
```python
#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the final output consists of the results of each test case based on the provided conditions.
```

#### Analysis
1. **Case 1: `n` is odd**
   - If `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` if the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - **Validation**:
     - **Example**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
       - Since `n` is odd, it checks if `2 * a < b` (i.e., `10 < 9`), which is false.
       - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (i.e., `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`), which is correct.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - If `n` is even, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` if the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - **Validation**:
     - **Example**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
       - Since `n` is even, it checks if `2 * a < b` (i.e., `10 < 11`), which is true.
       - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (i.e., `4 * 5 = 20`), which is correct.

3. **Edge Cases**
   - **Minimum Values**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
     - Expected: `1` (since `n` is odd and `2 * a = b`, it should buy 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
     - Output: `1` (correct).
   - **Maximum Values**: `n = 100`, `a = 30`, `b = 30`
     - Expected: `1500` (since `2 * a = b`, it should buy 50 pairs at `b` burles each).
     - Output: `1500` (correct).
   - **Promotion Cheaper**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Expected: `14` (since `2 * a < b`, it should buy 2 yogurts at `a` burles each and 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
     - Output: `14` (correct).
   - **Promotion More Expensive**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Expected: `20` (since `2 * a > b`, it should buy 2 pairs at `b` burles each).
     - Output: `20` (correct).

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the edge cases tested. There is no potential case where the program does not work as expected.

**Correctness: True**.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
