Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The conditions involving `n`, `a`, and `b` are:
  - If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
  - If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- The code snippet to be executed is:
  ```python
  print(a * n)
  ```

### Analysis:
The code snippet `print(a * n)` will calculate the product of `a` and `n` and print the result. The conditions involving `b` do not affect this calculation directly, as they are not used in the expression `a * n`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the product of the integers `a` and `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * n (where a is the value of a and n is the value of n)**
