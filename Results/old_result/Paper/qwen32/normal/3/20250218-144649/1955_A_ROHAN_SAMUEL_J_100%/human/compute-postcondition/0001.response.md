The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but this value is not affected by the code snippet provided. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are introduced and assigned specific integer values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
