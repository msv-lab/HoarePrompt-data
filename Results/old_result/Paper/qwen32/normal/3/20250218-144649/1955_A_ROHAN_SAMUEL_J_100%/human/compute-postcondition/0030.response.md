To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is mentioned but not used in the code snippet provided, so it does not affect the output.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The condition `2 * a < b` is checked, but it does not affect the calculation in the print statement.
- The parity (odd or even nature) of `n` does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Calculation:
- `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

### Output Description:
The output of the print statement is the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`. Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is an integer read from the input and b is an integer read from the input)**
