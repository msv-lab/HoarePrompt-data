Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to verify the correctness of the given solution.

### Problem Breakdown
The goal is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price of one yogurt (`a` burles) and the price of two yogurts on promotion (`b` burles). Maxim can choose to buy yogurts individually or in pairs at the promotion price.

### Program Analysis
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and then determines the minimum cost based on the following logic:

1. **If `n` is odd**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buy the remaining yogurt individually.
2. **If `n` is even**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases using the annotations.

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a < b` (10 < 9) is false.
   - Cost = `n // 2 * b` = 1 * 9 = 9.
   - **Output: 9** (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a < b` (10 < 9) is false.
   - Cost = `n // 2 * b + a` = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14.
   - **Output: 14** (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a < b` (10 < 11) is true.
   - Cost = `a * n` = 5 * 3 = 15.
   - **Output: 15** (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a < b` (10 < 11) is true.
   - Cost = `a * n` = 5 * 4 = 20.
   - **Output: 20** (Correct)

### Detailed Annotated Code Review
Let's review the annotated code to ensure the logic is correctly implemented:

```python
#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the final output consists of the results of each test case based on the provided conditions.
```

- **When `n` is odd**:
  - The program correctly checks if `2 * a < b`.
  - If true, it buys all yogurts individually.
  - If false, it buys as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually.
  
- **When `n` is even**:
  - The program correctly checks if `2 * a < b`.
  - If true, it buys all yogurts individually.
  - If false, it buys all yogurts in pairs.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices. It handles both even and odd values of `n` and compares the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs at the promotion price.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **True**
