In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` statement. This means the loop will iterate a number of times equal to the integer value read from the input. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts, but they are not directly involved in controlling the loop itself. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment to ensure the loop executes is the input that determines the number of iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can infer that `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case would trigger one iteration of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't need to be adjusted in the state description.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input to the loop is `t` which must be at least 1**.
