To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions and the initial state.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input. The logic inside the loop determines the output based on the parity of `n` and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:
- If `n` is odd:
  - If `2 * a < b`, the output is `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, the output is `n // 2 * b + a`.
- If `n` is even:
  - If `2 * a < b`, the output is `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, the output is `n // 2 * b`.

Given that we have the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute `t - 3` more times. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated in each iteration, but the logic for determining the output remains the same.

After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed all test cases, and the final output state will be determined by the results of these test cases.

Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the final output consists of the results of each test case based on the provided conditions.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the concatenation of the results from each of the `t` test cases, where each result is determined by the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for that test case and the conditions specified in the loop.
