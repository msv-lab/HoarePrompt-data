Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `2 * a < b`, the condition holds true; otherwise, it does not. The parity of `n` (odd or even) does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `n` is odd or even, the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` is determined solely by whether `2 * a` is less than `b` or not. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as specified in the precondition.
