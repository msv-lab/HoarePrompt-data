Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `2 * a < b`, the condition holds true according to the parity of `n`. Otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and the condition holds true according to the parity of `n`.**

In simpler terms: **`t` remains an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, inclusive. The integers `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged. The condition `2 * a < b` is evaluated, and its truth value is consistent with the parity of `n` as described in the precondition.**
