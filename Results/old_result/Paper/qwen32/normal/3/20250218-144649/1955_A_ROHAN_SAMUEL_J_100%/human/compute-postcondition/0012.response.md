To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the problem step by step using the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this calculation.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n // 2`**: Since `n` is an even integer, dividing `n` by 2 using integer division (`//`) will result in an integer. For example, if `n` is 10, `n // 2` will be 5.
2. **`n // 2 * b`**: This expression calculates the product of `n // 2` and `b`. For example, if `n` is 10 and `b` is 3, then `n // 2` is 5, and `5 * 3` is 15.

### Final Output:
The code will print the product of `n // 2` and `b`. Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is an even integer and b is an integer such that 2 * a >= b)**
