Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` holds true, i.e., if `2 * a < b`, the condition is true; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The parity of `n` (odd or even) does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.**
