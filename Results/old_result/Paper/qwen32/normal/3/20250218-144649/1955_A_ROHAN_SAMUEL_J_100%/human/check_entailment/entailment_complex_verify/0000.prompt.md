You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:

            else:

        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the final output consists of the results of each test case based on the provided conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relative values of `a` and `b`. The result is printed for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to ensure it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and `b` for two yogurts under promotion.
- **Constraints**:
  - Number of test cases, `t`: \(1 \le t \le 10^4\)
  - Number of yogurts, `n`: \(1 \le n \le 100\)
  - Price for one yogurt, `a`: \(1 \le a \le 30\)
  - Price for two yogurts on promotion, `b`: \(1 \le b \le 30\)

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Analysis
1. **Case 1: `n` is odd**
   - If `n` is odd, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` if the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - If `n` is even, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` if the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.

### Edge Cases
- **Minimum Values**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - Expected: `1` (since `n` is odd and `2 * a = b`, it should buy 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
  - Output: `1` (correct).

- **Maximum Values**: `n = 100`, `a = 30`, `b = 30`
  - Expected: `1500` (since `2 * a = b`, it should buy 50 pairs at `b` burles each).
  - Output: `1500` (correct).

- **Promotion Cheaper**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Expected: `14` (since `2 * a < b`, it should buy 2 yogurts at `a` burles each and 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
  - Output: `14` (correct).

- **Promotion More Expensive**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Expected: `20` (since `2 * a > b`, it should buy 2 pairs at `b` burles each).
  - Output: `20` (correct).

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the edge cases tested. There is no potential case where the program does not work as expected.

**Correctness: True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering whether the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying them individually, and it handles both odd and even values of `n` appropriately.
