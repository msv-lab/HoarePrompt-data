The given code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]` for some index `i`. However, the loop or range for `i` is not specified in the provided code snippet. Given the precondition, we can infer that `i` likely ranges from 0 to some value, but since the exact range is not provided, we can only describe the change that would occur for a specific `i`.

For the sake of providing a concrete output state, let's assume the loop runs for all valid `i` from 0 to `mid` (as per the initial state definition of `mid`).

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for the range of `i` in the loop, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from 0 to `mid`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `clique` is assigned to each element of `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid`. All other variables retain their initial values.
