The given code modifies the array `arr` by setting specific elements based on the values of `left`, `i`, `small_element`, and the loop variable `i`. The other variables (`right`, `clique`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) remain unchanged.

The specific impact is that for each `i` in the range of the loop (which is not specified in the snippet, but we assume `i` iterates over a valid range), `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`.

Given that `small_element` is `left + 1`, the value of `arr[left + i]` becomes `left + 1 + i`.

Since the loop variable `i` is not defined in the snippet, we'll assume `i` iterates over a range that is valid within the context of the problem (typically from 0 to some upper limit, but that is not specified here).

Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated array elements and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for the range of `i` in the loop.**
