### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the function summaries to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Graph Construction**: Assign each vertex a distinct integer from 1 to n.
2. **Edge Addition**: Add an edge between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
3. **Clique Partition**: Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques where every vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
  - Calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
  - Initializes two arrays: `arr` (to hold the assigned integers) and `cliquess` (to hold the clique numbers for each vertex).
  - Calls `make_array` for each clique to fill the arrays.
  - Prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

- **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
  - Fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for the given range `[left, right]` with the specified clique number.
  - It tries to assign integers in a way that might satisfy the edge condition, but the logic seems flawed.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Arrays**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used in both `func_1` and `make_array`, but they are not defined in a global scope. This will cause issues because they are not accessible from `make_array`.
2. **Logic for Assigning Integers**: The logic inside `make_array` does not guarantee that the assigned integers will satisfy the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \). The assignment seems arbitrary and may not form valid cliques.
3. **Minimum Number of Cliques**: The program attempts to minimize the number of cliques by calculating `ceil(n / k)`, but this is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required to satisfy the edge condition.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `make_array` modifies the array `arr` by filling a segment from index `left` to `right` with a specific sequence of numbers. The first half of this segment is filled with increasing numbers starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing numbers starting from `right + 1`. Simultaneously, it updates another array `cliquess` to set all values in the same segment to the given `clique` number.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Global Arrays**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are not defined globally. They are declared within `func_1` but are used in `make_array`. This will lead to a `NameError` because `make_array` does not have access to these arrays.

2. **Logic for Assigning Integers**: The logic in `make_array` does not ensure that the assigned integers will satisfy the edge condition. For example, if `left = 0` and `right = 1`, `arr` might be assigned `[1, 2]`, but if `k = 1`, the edge condition \( |0 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 2 \) is not satisfied, and no edge will be added between vertices 0 and 1.

3. **Minimum Number of Cliques**: The calculation of `ceil(n / k)` does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. The problem requires partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques, which might require a more sophisticated approach than simply dividing the vertices into segments of size `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to guarantee that the assigned integers form valid cliques and does not necessarily minimize the number of cliques.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
