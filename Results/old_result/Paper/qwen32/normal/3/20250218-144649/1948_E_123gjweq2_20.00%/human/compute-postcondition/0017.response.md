The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value (which we need to increment to start the next iteration). `not_mid` is a constant value derived from `right` and `left`, so it does not change.

To start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it should now be `x + 1`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
