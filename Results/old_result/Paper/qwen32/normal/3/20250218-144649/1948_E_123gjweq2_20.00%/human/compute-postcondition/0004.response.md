To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `mid`. The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0 because `range(mid)` will generate values from 0 up to `mid - 1`.

Let's analyze the given state and the loop:

- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.

The loop is:
```
for i in range(mid):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than 0. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`, `mid` will be greater than 0 if `right - left` is at least 2. This means `right` must be at least `left + 2`.

The variables `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, and `not_mid` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `right` is at least `left + 2` so that `mid` is greater than 0.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2**
