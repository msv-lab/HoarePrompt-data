Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Since this assignment is already true for all `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1` as per the initial state, the state remains unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the values of the arrays or the other variables.
