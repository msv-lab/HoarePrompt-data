To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```
for i in range(not_mid):
```

The variable `i` is the loop index, and `not_mid` is the range limit. The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0.

From the provided state, we know:
- `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`
- `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`

For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2` must be greater than 0. Simplifying this expression, we get:
- `not_mid` = `(right - left + 1) - mid`
- `not_mid` = `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`
- `not_mid` = `(right - left + 1) - floor((right - left) / 2)`

For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, `right - left + 1` must be greater than `floor((right - left) / 2)`. This is always true if `right - left + 1` is at least 2, which is consistent with the condition `right is at least left + 2`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `right - left + 1` is at least 2, which is already given in the problem statement.

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `not_mid` is calculated correctly based on the given values of `left` and `right`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2, `arr[left + i]` is left + 1 + i for each i from 0 to mid - 1, `cliquess[left + i]` is clique for each i from 0 to mid - 1**
