The given code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. However, the loop variable `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet, which means the assignment will only affect the element at the index `left + mid` (when `i` is 0, assuming the intention was to loop over `i`).

Given this, the element at index `left + mid` in the `cliquess` array will be set to `clique`. All other elements in `cliquess` and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.**
