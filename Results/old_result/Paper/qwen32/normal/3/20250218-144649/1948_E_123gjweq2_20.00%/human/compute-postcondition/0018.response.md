The given code snippet is:

```python
arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
```

This line of code updates the value of `arr` at the index `left + mid + i` to `big_element - i`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The code snippet specifically updates the value of `arr` at the index `left + mid + i` to `big_element - i`. This means that the value at that specific index in `arr` is recalculated and set to `big_element - i`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` at the specific index `left + mid + i` is `big_element - i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value at `arr[left + mid + i]` is updated to `big_element - i`, while all other values remain the same.
