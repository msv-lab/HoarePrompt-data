The given code snippet is:

```
cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

This line of code assigns the value of `clique` to the element of the `cliquess` array at the index `left + mid + i`.

Given the initial state:
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.

Since the code assigns `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`, and it was already `clique` before the assignment, this line of code does not change the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]`.

Thus, the state of the variables remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
