Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `mid` is calculated as `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2` or `(right - left) // 2`. Other variables remain unchanged.
