The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, which means the condition `j <= n` is not satisfied, and the loop has just finished executing. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be reset to its initial value, which is 1, and the condition `j <= n + r + 1` must be satisfied.

Given that `r` is 1, the loop will execute as long as `j <= n + 2`. Since the loop has just finished, we need to reset `j` to 1 to start the next iteration.

State: **`sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, `n` is at least 0, and `j` is 1**
