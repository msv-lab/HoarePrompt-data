Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeros by performing a limited number of operations (no more than \( 2n \)). The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Points:
1. **Type 1 Operation**: Fill the \( i \)-th row with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Fill the \( i \)-th column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, and the optimal strategy involves filling the matrix with the highest possible values in each row and column.

### Optimal Strategy:
- The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix such that each row and each column contains the numbers 1 through \( n \) exactly once. This ensures that each element in the matrix is part of a permutation.
- The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, repeated \( n \) times (once for each row).

### Implementation Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The code initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( n \) and calculates the sum. However, the logic seems incorrect:
     - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not appropriate for calculating the maximum sum.
     - The sum should be calculated as `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` for the entire matrix.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The number of operations `m` is calculated as `n + r`, which is not correct.
   - The operations are printed in a loop, but the logic for the operations is incorrect:
     - It prints a type 1 operation for the first \( n \) rows.
     - It prints a type 2 operation for the remaining operations, but the row/column index and permutation are not correctly managed.

### Correctness:
Given the incorrect logic in calculating the sum and the operations, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
