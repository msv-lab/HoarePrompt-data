The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the variable `sum` by the value of `i * n`. Given the initial state, `sum` is initially 0, and it will be updated to `i * n`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `r`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is `i * n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
