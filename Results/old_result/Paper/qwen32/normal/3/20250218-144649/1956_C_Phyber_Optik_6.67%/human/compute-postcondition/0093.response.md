The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` adds the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the current value of `sum`. Given that `sum` was initially 0, it will now hold the value `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

Other variables (`j`, `n`, `r`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
