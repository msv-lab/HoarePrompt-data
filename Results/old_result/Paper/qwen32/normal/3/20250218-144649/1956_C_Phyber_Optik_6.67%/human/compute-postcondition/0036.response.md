Postcondition: **`sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, `n` is at least 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. The condition `j <= n` is not satisfied, so the else part is executed, which does not change the values of `sum`, `r`, `n`, or `j`.**

Since the if condition `j <= n` is not satisfied (as `j` is initialized to `n + 1`), the else part is executed, but it does not alter the values of `sum`, `r`, `n`, or `j`. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
