Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- `sum` is the sum of some series, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2`, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break down what this print statement does:
- It prints the integer `2` first.
- It then prints the result of `j % n`. Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. This value will be between `0` and `n-1` (inclusive).
- The `end=' '` argument means that instead of ending the print with a newline, it will end with a space.

Given that `j` is greater than `n`, the exact value of `j % n` depends on the specific value of `j`. However, we can describe it as "the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`," which will be a value between `0` and `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, [j % n] (where [j % n] is the remainder when j is divided by n)**
