To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`
- `r` is 1
- `n` is at least 0
- `j` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the values:
- `2` is a constant integer value.
- `j % n` is the modulus operation which computes the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Given `j` is 1, the result of `j % n` depends on the value of `n`.

Since `n` is at least 0, we need to consider the possible values of `n`:
- If `n` is 0, the operation `1 % 0` would result in a ZeroDivisionError. However, the precondition specifies `n` is at least 0, implying `n` could be 0, but in practical terms, the modulus operation with `n=0` is undefined. We'll assume `n` is at least 1 to avoid division by zero.
- If `n` is 1, `1 % 1` equals 0.
- If `n` is greater than 1, `1 % n` will always be 1 because 1 divided by any number greater than 1 leaves a remainder of 1.

Given the problem context and the fact that `n` is at least 0, we'll consider the most common and practical case where `n` is at least 1. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, `j % n` will be:
- 0 if `n` is 1
- 1 if `n` is greater than 1

However, since the problem does not specify a particular value for `n` greater than 1, we'll consider the general case where `n` is at least 1.

Thus, the print statement will output:
- `2` (the constant integer)
- `j % n` (which is `1 % n` and evaluates to 0 if `n` is 1, or 1 if `n` is greater than 1)

Given the general case where `n` is at least 1, the output will be:
Output: **2, 1 (where n is at least 1)**

However, to strictly adhere to the format and considering the most precise description based on the precondition:
Output: **2, j % n (where j is 1 and n is at least 1)**
