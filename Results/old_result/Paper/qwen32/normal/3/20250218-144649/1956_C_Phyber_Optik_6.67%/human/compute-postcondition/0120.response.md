Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0 (though `r` is not used in the print statement, it's provided in the initial state)

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Value of `2`:** This is a constant integer value 2.
2. **Value of `j % n`:** 
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is 1
   - The modulus operation `j % n` computes the remainder of the division of `j` by `n`.
   - Since 2 divided by 1 is 2 with a remainder of 0, `j % n` evaluates to 0.
3. **`end=' '`:** This argument specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the values `2` and `0` separated by a space, and it will not move to a new line afterward.

Output: **2 0 **
