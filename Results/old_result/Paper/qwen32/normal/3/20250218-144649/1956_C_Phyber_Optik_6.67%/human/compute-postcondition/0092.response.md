The value of `r` is updated to the value of `i`. The values of `j`, `sum`, `n`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
