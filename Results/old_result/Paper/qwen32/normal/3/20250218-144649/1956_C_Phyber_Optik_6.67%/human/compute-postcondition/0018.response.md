Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `sum` will be increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `r`) will remain unchanged. The condition `If n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not relevant for determining the output state since the code snippet directly adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 5; `r` is 5; `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
