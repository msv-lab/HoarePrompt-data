The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all the numbers from 1 up to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- `n` is at least 0.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence and prints each number separated by a space.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't generate the exact numerical sequence. However, we can describe the output based on the precondition.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is at least 0)**
