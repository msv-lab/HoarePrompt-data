The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't intend to use. The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. Since the underscore is not used in the loop body, the only variable we need to ensure is correctly set is `t`.

Given that `t` is already described as an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is already within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute as long as `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
