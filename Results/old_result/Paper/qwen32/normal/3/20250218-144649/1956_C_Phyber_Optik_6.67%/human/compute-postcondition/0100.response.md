The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by `i * n`. Given the initial state, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, and `i` is `i + 1` after the previous state. Therefore, `sum` will now be the previous value of `sum` plus `i * n`.

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n`, or `i * n + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on the condition, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `sum` is increased by `i * n`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `sum`.
