To determine the final output state after all executions of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior for each test case:

1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**:
    - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, the inner loop calculates `sum` and `r` based on the input size `n`.
    - After calculating `sum` and `r`, it prints `sum` and `n + r`.
    - It then prints a sequence of commands based on the values of `n` and `r`.

2. **Loop Execution Details**:
    - The inner loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, it updates `sum` and `r` based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
    - If the condition is true, `r` is updated to `i`, and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
    - If the condition is false, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

3. **Output State Calculation**:
    - For each test case, the final `sum` and `r` are calculated and printed.
    - The final `sum` is the accumulated value from the inner loop.
    - The final `r` is the last value that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
    - The final `n + r` is printed after `sum`.
    - The sequence of commands is printed based on the values of `n` and `r`.

Given the provided output states for the first three iterations, let's generalize the final output state:

- **Output State after the loop executes 1 time**: `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r = 1`, `n = n`
- **Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `n + r + 1` after the loop completes all iterations; `sum`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- **Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 2, `n` is 1, `r` is 1.

To determine the final output state after all `t` iterations, we need to consider the accumulated effect of all test cases:

- The final `sum` will be the sum of `sum` values from each test case.
- The final `r` for each test case is determined by the inner loop and will vary based on the input `n`.
- The final `n + r` is printed after `sum` for each test case.
- The sequence of commands is printed for each test case.

Since the output state for each test case is independent of the others (each test case is processed separately), the final output state after all `t` iterations will be the concatenation of the output states for each individual test case.

Output State: **The final output state after all iterations is the concatenation of the output states for each test case, where each test case prints `sum` and `n + r`, followed by a sequence of commands based on `n` and `r`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the result of processing each test case independently and printing the results sequentially.
