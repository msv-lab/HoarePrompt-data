Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement step by step.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `j` is `n + r`
- `sum` is either `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on the condition
- `i` is `i + 1`

The for loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. We need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.

However, we need to ensure that the loop can still execute, which means `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to check if the new value of `i` is still within the range.

Since `i` was incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration. We need to make sure that this new value of `i` is less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration (which is `i + 1` from the previous state)
- `n` remains the same

The other variables (`j`, `sum`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted according to the loop statement.

State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on the condition, `i` is `i + 1`**
