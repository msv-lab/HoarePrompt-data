To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2` (This is the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers).
2. `r` is 1.
3. `n` is at least 0.
4. `j` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence generated by `range` and prints each number separated by a space.
- Since `n` is at least 0, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n` (if `n` is 0, the range will be empty).

### Possible Outputs:
- If `n` is 0: `range(1, 0 + 1)` will generate an empty sequence, so nothing will be printed.
- If `n` is 1: `range(1, 1 + 1)` will generate the sequence [1], so the output will be `1`.
- If `n` is 2: `range(1, 2 + 1)` will generate the sequence [1, 2], so the output will be `1 2`.
- If `n` is 3: `range(1, 3 + 1)` will generate the sequence [1, 2, 3], so the output will be `1 2 3`.
- And so on...

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is at least 0)**

If `n` is 0, the output will be **(empty)**. For any `n >= 1`, the output will be the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.
