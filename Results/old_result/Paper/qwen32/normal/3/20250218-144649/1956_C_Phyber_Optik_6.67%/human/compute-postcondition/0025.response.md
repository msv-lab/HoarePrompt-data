To determine the output, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`: This formula calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- `r = 1`: The variable `r` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` must be at least 0: This indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`: This means `j` can take any value from 0 up to `n` (inclusive).

### Print Statement:
```
print(1, j, end=' ')
```
The print statement will output the values of `1` and `j`, separated by a space, and it will not add a newline character at the end (because `end=' '`).

### Analysis:
- The value `1` is explicitly given in the print statement.
- The value of `j` is not explicitly provided, but we know it is a value between 0 and `n` (inclusive).

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `j`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output `1` followed by the value of `j`, separated by a space, and without a newline character at the end.

Output: **1 j (where j is a value between 0 and n inclusive)**
