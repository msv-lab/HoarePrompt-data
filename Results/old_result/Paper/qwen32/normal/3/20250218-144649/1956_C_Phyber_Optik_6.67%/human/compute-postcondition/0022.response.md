To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of the variables `sum` and `n + r` based on the initial state provided.

1. The initial state tells us that `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`. This means `sum` is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
2. The initial state also tells us that `r = 1`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(sum, n + r)
```

Let's break down the values:
- `sum` is calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- `n + r` is simply `n + 1` because `r` is 1.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `sum` and `n + r`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) // 2, n + 1 (where n * (n + 1) // 2 is the sum of the first n natural numbers and n + 1 is the result of adding 1 to n)**
