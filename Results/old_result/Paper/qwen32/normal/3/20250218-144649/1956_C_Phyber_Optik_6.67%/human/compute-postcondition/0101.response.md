Postcondition: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on the condition, `i` is `i + 1`.**
