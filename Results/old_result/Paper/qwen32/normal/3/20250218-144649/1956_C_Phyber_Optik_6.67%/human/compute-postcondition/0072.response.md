Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `sum` is the sum of a series (though it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2` (which is at least 1 if `n` is at least 2).
- `j` is greater than `n` (though it is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks this sequence so that each number in the sequence is printed separated by a space.

Since `n` is at least 2, the minimum sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` will be `range(1, 3)`, which results in the numbers 1 and 2. If `n` were 3, the sequence would be `range(1, 4)`, resulting in the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and so on.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is at least 2)**

To be more precise, if we assume the minimum value for `n` which is 2, the output would be:
Output: **1 2**

However, since `n` can be any value greater than or equal to 2, the most precise description is:
Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is at least 2)**
