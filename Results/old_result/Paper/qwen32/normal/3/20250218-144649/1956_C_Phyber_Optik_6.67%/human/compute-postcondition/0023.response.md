To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and its head:

The for loop is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n + r + 1)` is non-empty. This means that the start of the range (which is 1) must be less than the end of the range (`n + r + 1`). 

Given the initial state:
- `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`
- `r = 1`

For the loop to execute, `n + r + 1` must be greater than 1. Since `r` is already 1, the condition simplifies to `n + 2 > 1`, which further simplifies to `n > -1`. Since `n` is typically a non-negative integer in such contexts, we just need to ensure that `n` is at least 0.

The variable `j` is the loop variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts; it will be set to the first value in the range when the loop begins.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 0.

State: **`sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r = 1`, `n` must be at least 0**
