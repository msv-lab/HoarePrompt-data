Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`: This formula calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- `r = 1`: This variable is assigned the value 1.
- `n` must be at least 0: This means `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `j = n + 1`: This variable `j` is assigned the value of `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement uses the `range` function to generate numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints them. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object so that its elements are printed on the same line separated by spaces.

- `range(1, n + 1)`: This generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the sequence so that each number is printed separately.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, each separated by a space. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**

This output represents the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` printed on the same line, separated by spaces.
