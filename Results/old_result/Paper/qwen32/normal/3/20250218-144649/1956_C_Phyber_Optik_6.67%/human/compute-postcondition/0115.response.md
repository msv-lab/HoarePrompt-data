Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0
- The condition `j > n` is given, but in this case, `j` is not greater than `n` (both are 1).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
- Given that `n` is 1, `range(1, 1 + 1)` translates to `range(1, 2)`.
- `range(1, 2)` generates a sequence containing the single number 1.
- The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the sequence generated by `range` and prints each element separated by a space.

### Output:
Since `range(1, 2)` generates the sequence [1], the `print` statement will print:
Output: **1**
