The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 up to `n`, inclusive. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object so that the numbers are printed on the same line separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, we know that `n` is at least 2, but its exact value is not specified. The values of `sum`, `r`, and `j` are not directly relevant to the `print` statement in question, as the statement only uses `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is at least 2)**
