The code snippet initializes two variables, `sum` and `r`, both to 0. The initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged as they are input integers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `sum` is 0; `r` is 0.**
