To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), so `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `i * n`.
- `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `r` is 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. The values of `sum` and `r` depend on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, but since we are only adjusting the variables in the loop head, we do not need to adjust `sum` and `r`. We only need to adjust `i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.

State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `i * n`. `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `r` is 0. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
