Postcondition: ***`sum` is `3 * n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` initially, or `i * n + 2 * n * (n + 1) // 2` otherwise; `r` is `i + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, otherwise `r` is `0`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`.***

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block executes, `sum` and `r` are updated based on the initial condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The values of `n`, `t`, and `i` are also maintained or updated as specified.
