Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the t test cases is described by three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `k` is 0. It is not the case that ((b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0)**

To break it down:
- `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- Each test case is described by three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` with values between 0 and 10^9.
- `k` remains 0.
- The condition ((b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0) is false. This means at least one part of the condition is not satisfied.
