The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value `-1`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `n`, `k`), but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is set to 3.
- `n` is set to 5.
- `k` is set to 0.

However, the `print(-1)` statement directly outputs the integer `-1` without referencing any of these variables.

Output: **-1**
