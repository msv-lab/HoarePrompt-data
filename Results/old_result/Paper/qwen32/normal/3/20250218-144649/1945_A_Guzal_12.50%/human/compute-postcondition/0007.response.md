The value of `k` is incremented by the sum of `a` and the integer division of `b + c` by 3. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The condition `((b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0)` is still not satisfied.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the t test cases is described by three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
