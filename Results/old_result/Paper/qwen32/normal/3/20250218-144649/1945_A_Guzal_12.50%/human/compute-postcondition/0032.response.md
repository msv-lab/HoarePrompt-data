Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), where `a` represents the number of introverts, `b` represents the number of extroverts, and `c` represents the number of universals. The function returns the result for each test case based on these inputs.**
