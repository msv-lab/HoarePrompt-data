To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the conditions and calculations provided in the initial state.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`:** A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **Variables `a`, `b`, and `c`:** For each test case, these are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
3. **Variable `k`:** This value is calculated based on the condition:
   - If \((b + c) \% 3 \neq 0\), then \(k = a + \frac{(b + c)}{3} + 1\).
   - Otherwise, \(k = a + \frac{(b + c)}{3}\).

### Calculation of `k`:
- **Step 1:** Compute the sum \(s = b + c\).
- **Step 2:** Compute the integer division of \(s\) by 3, which is \(\frac{s}{3}\).
- **Step 3:** Check the condition \(s \% 3 \neq 0\):
  - If true, then \(k = a + \frac{s}{3} + 1\).
  - If false, then \(k = a + \frac{s}{3}\).

### Output Description:
The value of `k` depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can only describe `k` in terms of these variables.

Output: **k (where k is calculated as a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 if (b + c) % 3 != 0, otherwise k is a + (b + c) // 3)**
