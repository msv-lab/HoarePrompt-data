The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` was `a + (b + c) // 3`. After the increment, `k` becomes `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is 3; `n` is 5; `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.**
