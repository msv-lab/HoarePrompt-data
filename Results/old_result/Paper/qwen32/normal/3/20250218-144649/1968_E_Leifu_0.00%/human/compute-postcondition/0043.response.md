Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The variable `i` is still equal to `t-1`. The variable `n` must have been at least 4 for the loop to execute at all, and `j` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes executing all its iterations.
