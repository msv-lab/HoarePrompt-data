The provided `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print('1 2')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'1 2'`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` are not used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the initial state provided.

Output: **1 2**
