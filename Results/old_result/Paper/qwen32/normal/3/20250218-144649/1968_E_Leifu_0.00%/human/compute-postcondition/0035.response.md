The `print('2 3')` statement in the provided code snippet will output the string `'2 3'` directly. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is printing a hardcoded string.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `i` is defined as `t-1`.
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `j` is either unchanged from its previous definition or undefined if `n` is 3, and `j` is set to `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print('2 3')` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'2 3'`.

Output: **2 3**
