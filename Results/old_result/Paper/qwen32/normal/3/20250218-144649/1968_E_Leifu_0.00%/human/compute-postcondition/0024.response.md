To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to evaluate the values of the variables `j` and how they are used in the statement.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `i` is assigned the value of `t`.
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `j` is assigned the value of `n` + 1.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This statement will concatenate the string representation of `j` with a space and then with the string representation of `j` again. Therefore, the output will be `j j` where `j` is the value of `n + 1`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only express the output in terms of `n`. However, we know that `n` is at least 4, so `j` is at least 5.

The output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **j j (where j is the value of n + 1 and n is at least 4)**

For example, if `n` were 4, then `j` would be 5, and the output would be `5 5`. If `n` were 5, then `j` would be 6, and the output would be `6 6`, and so on.
