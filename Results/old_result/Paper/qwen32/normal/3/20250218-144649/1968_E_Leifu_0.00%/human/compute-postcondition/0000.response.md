Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 50. The precondition for `n` in each of the `t` test cases remains valid.**

In simpler terms: `t` is now an integer input by the user, constrained to be between 1 and 50. The conditions for `n` in each test case are still in effect.
