Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the old `x`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input. The element at index `l[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, `flag` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
