Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` satisfies `1 <= p_i <= n` and `p_i != i`. The function returns the number of swaps needed to sort the list `p` in ascending order for each test case.**
