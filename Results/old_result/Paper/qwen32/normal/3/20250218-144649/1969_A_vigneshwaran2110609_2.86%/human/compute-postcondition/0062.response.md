To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve within it.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer provided as input satisfying `2 <= n <= 50`.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs `x` times, where `x` is an integer input during each iteration of the outer loop.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the inner loop, there is a condition check `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If this condition is met, the `flag` is set to `True`, `2` is printed, and the inner loop is broken.
4. **Else Clause**: If the inner loop completes all `x` iterations without meeting the condition, `3` is printed.

### Given Output States:
- **After 1 iteration**: The inner loop completes all `x` iterations and prints `3`.
- **After 2 iterations**: The inner loop completes all `x` iterations and prints `3`.
- **After 3 iterations**: The inner loop completes all `x` iterations and prints `3`.

### Generalization:
From the given output states, it is clear that for each of the first three iterations, the inner loop completes all `x` iterations without meeting the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. Therefore, `3` is printed each time.

### Final Output State:
Since the pattern observed in the first three iterations suggests that the inner loop completes all `x` iterations without meeting the condition for each outer loop iteration, we can reasonably conclude that this pattern will continue for all `n` iterations.

Thus, the final output state after all `n` iterations of the outer loop will be that `3` is printed `n` times.

### Final State in Required Format:
Output State: **3 is printed n times.**

In natural language, this means that the output of the program will consist of the number `3` printed a total of `n` times, where `n` is the number of iterations of the outer loop.
