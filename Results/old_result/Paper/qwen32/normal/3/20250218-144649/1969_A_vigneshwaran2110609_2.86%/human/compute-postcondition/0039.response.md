Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the old `x`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
