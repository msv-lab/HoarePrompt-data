The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. This means that the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, but it will still satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 50. The other variables `t` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, where `n` is the value provided by the input; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`.**
