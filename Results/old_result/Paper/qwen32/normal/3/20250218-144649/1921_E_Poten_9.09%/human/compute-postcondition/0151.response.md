The code snippet appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. None of the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4, `answers` contains the string 'Draw'**.
