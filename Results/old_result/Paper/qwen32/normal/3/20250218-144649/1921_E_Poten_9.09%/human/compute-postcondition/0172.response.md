Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of two distinct points within it. For each test case, it determines the outcome of a game where two players, Alice and Bob, are positioned at the given points. The function prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the specific conditions related to the positions and the dimensions of the rectangle.**
