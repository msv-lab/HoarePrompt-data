Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'.**

Natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The variable `test_cases` still equals `t` and is greater than 0. The list `clues` retains its initial value of integers obtained from the input. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since the code snippet does not modify `i`, this part of the description is unchanged. The list `answers` now contains the string 'Draw'.
