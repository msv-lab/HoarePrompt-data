The code snippet appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. The current value of `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`. Additionally, either `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true.**
