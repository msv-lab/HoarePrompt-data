In the given initial state, the variable `j` is not mentioned or defined. The provided information includes the definitions of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, `i`, and `answers`, but `j` is not part of the described initial state.

Since `j` is not defined in the given context, the execution of the `print(j)` statement would result in a `NameError` because Python does not recognize `j` as a defined variable.

However, if we assume that `j` is supposed to be a variable that is defined elsewhere in the code (which is not shown here), we would need that information to determine its value.

Given the current information, the output of the print statement is not determinable due to the undefined variable `j`.

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
