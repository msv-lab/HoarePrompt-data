The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `clues`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and `answers` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
