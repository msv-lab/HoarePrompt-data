The code snippet appends the string 'Alice' to the list `answers`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `answers` contains 'Alice'**.
