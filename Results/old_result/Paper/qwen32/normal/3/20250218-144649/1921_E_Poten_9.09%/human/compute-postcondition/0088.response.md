The code snippet provided appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. This operation modifies the `answers` list by adding a new element to it. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`**.
