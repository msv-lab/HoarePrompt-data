To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and see if there is any information provided about the variable `j`. 

Here is the provided initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0.
- `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is equal to `t`.
- `answers` is a list containing at least one element.

However, there is no information provided about a variable `j` in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `j` from the given information. The variable `j` is not defined or mentioned in the initial state.

Since we do not have any information about the value of `j`, it is impossible to determine what will be printed by `print(j)`.

Output: **j (where j is an undefined variable)**
