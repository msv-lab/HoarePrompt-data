Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` list has a new element 'Draw' appended to it.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` remains the same, `test_cases` remains equal to `t`, `clues` remains the same list of integers, `i` remains incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), and a new string 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list.
