Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string `'Draw'` or the string `'Bob'`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2]` <= `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1. If `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` contains `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` contains `'Bob'`.**
