Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `answers` is a list that now contains the string 'Alice'.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `answers` now contains the string 'Alice'. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
