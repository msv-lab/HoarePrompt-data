Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` has a new element 'Draw' appended to it.**

Natural Language: The variable `answers` now includes an additional element, the string 'Draw'. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
