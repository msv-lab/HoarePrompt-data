The code snippet provided is `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)`. This line of code appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is determined by converting the integer `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character using the `chr` function.

Given the initial state, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, so `s[j]` will always be `0` for any valid index `j`. Therefore, `s[j] + 97` will be `97`, and `chr(97)` corresponds to the character `'a'`.

Thus, the string `ans` will have the character `'a'` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the newly input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a newly input list of integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is a string with the value `'a'`**.
