The code snippet `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `array`. This means that `array` will now hold the integers provided in the input, replacing its previous value.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is `0`; `array` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the values in `s` after all iterations; `i` is `i + 1`.**
