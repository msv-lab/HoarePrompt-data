The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the `ans` variable by appending a character to it. The character is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`. Since `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `s[j]` will be 0 for any valid index `j`. Therefore, `chr(s[j] + 97)` will always be `chr(97)`, which is the character 'a'.

Given the initial state, the variable `ans` is an empty string. After executing the code, `ans` will be the string 'a'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` zeros; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `ans` is the string 'a'**.
