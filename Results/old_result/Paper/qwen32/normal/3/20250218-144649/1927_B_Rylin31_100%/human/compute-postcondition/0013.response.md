The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2. After executing the code, `s[j]` will be 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 3; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one more element; `ans` is the string 'abc'; `j` is the next element in `array`**.
