The code snippet provided increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. Given the initial state, `s[j]` has already been incremented by 1 previously, so this operation will increment it by an additional 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where `s[j]` has been incremented by 2; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have more than one element; `ans` is a string containing the character `'a'` followed by the character `chr(s[j] + 97)` and then another character `chr(s[j] + 97)`, `j` is the next element in `array`.**
