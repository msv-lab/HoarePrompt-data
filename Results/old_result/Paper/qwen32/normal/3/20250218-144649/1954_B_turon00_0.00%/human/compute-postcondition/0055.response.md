The given Python code snippet initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables provided in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `cnt` to 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `i` is `t + 2`; `ans` is the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0.**
