The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `t + 2`.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `i` is `t + 2`. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.**
