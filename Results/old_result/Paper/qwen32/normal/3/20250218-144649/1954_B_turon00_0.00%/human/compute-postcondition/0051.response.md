Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `i` is `t + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.**
