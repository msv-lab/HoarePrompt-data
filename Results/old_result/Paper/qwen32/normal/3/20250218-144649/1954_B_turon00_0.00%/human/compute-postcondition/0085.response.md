The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables as they were defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than `t`, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, and `i` is `t + 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of the newly input integer `n` and 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of either 0 or 1 and `cnt`. `cnt` is 0.**
