Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
