Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` based on the given array `x`. However, the logic in the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the required conditions. Specifically, the function tries to set `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, but this does not guarantee that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that each `a_i` satisfies the condition `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`. One straightforward way to achieve this is to set `a_1` to a large number (e.g., `10^9`), and then set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i` for some integer `k`, and thus `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n  # Set a_1 to a large number
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]  # Ensure a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i
    return ans
```

Given the original implementation of `func_1`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
