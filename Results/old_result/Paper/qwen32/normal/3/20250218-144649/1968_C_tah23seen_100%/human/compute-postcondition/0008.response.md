The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was initially `n - 3`, it is now `n - 4`. The values of `arr`, `n`, `ans`, and the specific conditions on `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` must be at least 4; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`; `i` is `n - 4`.**
