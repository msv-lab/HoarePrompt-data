### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem. The problem requires constructing an array `a` such that for each `2 <= i <= n`, `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`, where `x_i` is given.

The function summary provided states that the function `func_1` is supposed to set `ans[i]` to `1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])` for `i` from 0 to `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` to `1000000000`. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is different. It sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for `i` from `n-2` to `0`.

Let's examine the logic of the actual implementation:
- The array `ans` is initialized with `10^9` for all elements.
- The loop starts from `i = n-2` and decrements `i` down to `0`.
- For each `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

This means that the value of `ans[i]` is dependent on the value of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. However, this approach does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i-1] = arr[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

To correctly solve the problem, a more straightforward approach would be to:
1. Set `a_1` to a large number, say `10^9`.
2. For each `i` from `2` to `n`, set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}` because `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}`, and thus `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}`.

The original assessment correctly points out that the provided `func_1` does not implement the required logic. The function summary does not accurately describe the behavior of the actual implementation of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The given program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
