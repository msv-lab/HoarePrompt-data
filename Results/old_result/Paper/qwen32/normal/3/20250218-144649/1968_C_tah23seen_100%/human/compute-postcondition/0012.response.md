To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `ans` list.

The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n - 2` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop body sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This means that each element in `ans` is calculated based on the subsequent element and the corresponding element in `arr`.

Let's break down the process:
1. Initially, `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each initialized to `1000000000`.
2. The loop starts with `i = n - 2` and sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
3. In the next iteration, `i` becomes `n - 3` and `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
4. This process continues until `i` becomes `-1` (the loop exits when `i < 0`).

After all iterations, the `ans` list will be filled such that:
- `ans[n-2] = 1000000000 - arr[n-2]`
- `ans[n-3] = (1000000000 - arr[n-2]) - arr[n-3]`
- `ans[n-4] = ((1000000000 - arr[n-2]) - arr[n-3]) - arr[n-4]`
- And so on, until `ans[0] = (1000000000 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-3] - ... - arr[1]) - arr[0]`

In other words, each element `ans[i]` will be `1000000000` minus the sum of the elements in `arr` from index `i` to `n-2`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[i] = 1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1] = 1000000000`; `i` is `-1`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the `ans` list will have each element calculated as `1000000000` minus the sum of the elements in `arr` from that index to the second last index of `arr`, with the last element of `ans` remaining `1000000000`.
