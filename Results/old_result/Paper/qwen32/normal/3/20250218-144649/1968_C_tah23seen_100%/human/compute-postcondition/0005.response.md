The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Initially, `i` is `n - 2`, so after the operation, `i` becomes `n - 3`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i]`; `i` is `n - 3`**.
