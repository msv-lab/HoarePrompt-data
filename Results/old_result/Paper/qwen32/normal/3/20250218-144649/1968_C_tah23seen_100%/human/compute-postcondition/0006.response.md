To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables used in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `i >= 0`.

Given:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- The loop condition is `i >= 0`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` is currently `n - 3`, we need to ensure that `n - 3 >= 0`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `i`. However, since `i` is derived from `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is adjusted such that `i` will still be valid for another iteration. Specifically, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 4` (since `i` is decremented in each iteration), and we need `n - 4 >= 0`, which simplifies to `n >= 4`.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4. No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` must be at least 4; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i]`; `i` is `n - 3`**
