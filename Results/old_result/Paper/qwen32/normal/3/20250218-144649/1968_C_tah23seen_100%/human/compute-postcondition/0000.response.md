The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to the value \(10^9\). This operation does not affect the variables `arr` or `n`, which retain their initial values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\), and `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\). The length of `arr` is \(n-1\). `ans` is a list of `n` elements, each set to \(10^9\).**
