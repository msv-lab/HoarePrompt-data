To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the condition under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `power` is less than `log2(n)`. The loop increments `power` by 1 in each iteration.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration, `power` is 2, which means `log2(n)` must be at least 2, so `n` must be greater than 2.
- After 2 iterations, `power` is 3, which means `log2(n)` must be at least 3, so `n` must be greater than 4.
- After 3 iterations, `power` is 4, which means `log2(n)` must be at least 4, so `n` must be greater than 8.

The loop will stop when `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be equal to the integer part of `log2(n)` plus one, because the loop increments `power` until it is no longer less than `log2(n)`.

The final state of `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, which is `ceil(log2(n))`. Since `power` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and starts from 1, the final value of `power` will be `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.

In simpler terms, `power` will be the smallest integer `k` such that `2^(k-1) < n <= 2^k`.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `n_cases` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.

Given the pattern, if the loop executes `m` times, `power` becomes `m + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `power` is `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `n_cases` remains the same as the initial number of test cases, `n` remains the same as the input integer, and `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n` plus one.
