To determine the final output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions. The loop increments the `power` variable until it is no longer less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer:
- After 1 iteration: `power` is 2, which means `log2(n)` must be between 1 and 2 (exclusive).
- After 2 iterations: `power` is 3, which means `log2(n)` must be between 2 and 3 (exclusive).
- After 3 iterations: `power` is 4, which means `log2(n)` must be between 3 and 4 (exclusive).

Therefore, the loop will continue to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. This implies that `power` will reach the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.

To find the final state, we need to determine the smallest integer `k` such that `k >= log2(n)`. This `k` is essentially `ceil(log2(n))`.

Given that the loop increments `power` from 1, the final value of `power` will be `ceil(log2(n))`. The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as it is not affected by the loop's condition or body. The value of `n_cases` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop's logic.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `power` is `ceil(log2(n))`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, `i` will have been incremented by 1, and `n_cases` will remain the same.
