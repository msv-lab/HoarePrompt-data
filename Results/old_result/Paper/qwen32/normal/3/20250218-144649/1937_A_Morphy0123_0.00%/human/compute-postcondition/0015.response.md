Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `n` is the integer value of the input.
3. `power` is calculated as `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.
4. The current value of `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `power` is explicitly given as `n`.
- Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of `2` raised to the power of `n`.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **2 ** n (where n is the integer value of the input)**
