In the given task, the for loop will iterate over the range of `n_cases`. The loop will execute as long as `n_cases` is at least 1, because `range(n_cases)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `n_cases`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `n_cases` must be greater than 0**.
