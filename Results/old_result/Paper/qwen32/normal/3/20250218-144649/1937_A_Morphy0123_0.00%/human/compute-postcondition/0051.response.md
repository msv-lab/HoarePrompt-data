Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `n` is unchanged (the value of `n` is not explicitly provided, but it's a known value).
3. `i` is `i + 1` (the value of `i` is incremented by 1).
4. `power` is `ceil(log2(n))` (the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`).
5. `power` equals `n` (this implies that `n` is a power of 2 and `n` itself is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`).

### Analysis:
- Since `power` is defined as `ceil(log2(n))` and it equals `n`, it means `n` must be a power of 2 and `n` itself must be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. This can only be true if `n` is 1 or 2.
- If `n` were 1, `log2(1)` is 0, and `ceil(0)` is 0, which does not match `n`. Therefore, `n` cannot be 1.
- If `n` were 2, `log2(2)` is 1, and `ceil(1)` is 1, which still does not match `n`. However, if we consider `n` to be a power of 2 such that `n = 2^k` for some integer `k`, then `log2(n) = k` and `ceil(k) = k`. For `power` to equal `n`, `n` must be 2 because `log2(2) = 1` and `ceil(1) = 1` does not satisfy the condition. The only possibility that fits all conditions is when `n` itself is a power of 2 and `power` equals `n`, which can only be true if `n` is 2 (since `log2(2) = 1` and `ceil(1) = 1` doesn't fit, we need to consider the next power of 2 which is 4, `log2(4) = 2` and `ceil(2) = 2` fits).

Given the constraints, the only value of `n` that fits all conditions is `n = 4` (since `log2(4) = 2` and `ceil(2) = 2` does not fit, the next power of 2 is 4, `log2(4) = 2` and `ceil(2) = 2` fits).

Thus, `power` is 4, and `2 ** power` is `2 ** 4`, which equals 16.

### Conclusion:
The `print(2 ** power)` statement will print `2 ** 4`, which is 16.

Output: **16**
