You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')

                q = 2 ** (p - 1)

    for i in range(int(input())):

                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` reflect the values from the last test case. Any intermediate variables (`l`, `p`, `q`, `f`) reflect their values from the last iteration where they were used.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the absolute difference between the two integers and prints a specific result. The result is the largest power of 2 that divides the absolute difference if it is a power of 2, 1 if the difference is odd, or a derived value if the difference is even and not a power of 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment of two sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) defined as:
- \(a_n = n \oplus x\)
- \(b_n = n \oplus y\)

Where \(x\) and \(y\) are given non-negative integers, and \(\oplus\) denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**: The XOR operation has the property that \(a \oplus a = 0\) and \(a \oplus 0 = a\).
2. **Common Subsegments**: To find the longest common subsegment, we need to find the longest sequence of consecutive integers \(n\) such that \(a_n = b_n\). This translates to finding the longest sequence where \(n \oplus x = n \oplus y\), which simplifies to finding the longest sequence where \(x = y\). Since \(x \neq y\), we instead look for patterns based on the difference \(k = |x - y|\).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - If \(k\) is a power of 2 (i.e., \(k \& (k - 1) == 0\)), then the longest common subsegment is \(k\).
   - If \(k\) is odd, the longest common subsegment is 1.
   - If \(k\) is even and not a power of 2, the longest common subsegment can be found by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) until the result is a power of 2.

### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to implement this logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. **Difference Calculation**: It calculates \(k = |x - y|\).
3. **Power of 2 Check**: If \(k\) is a power of 2, it prints \(k\).
4. **Odd Check**: If \(k\) is odd, it prints 1.
5. **Even and Not Power of 2**: For even \(k\) that is not a power of 2, it repeatedly subtracts the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) until the result is a power of 2, and then prints this result.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Power of 2 Check**: The condition `k & k - 1 == 0` correctly identifies if \(k\) is a power of 2.
- **Odd Check**: The condition `k % 2 != 0` correctly identifies if \(k\) is odd.
- **Even and Not Power of 2**: The loop `while f & f - 1 != 0` correctly reduces \(k\) to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment based on the given problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
