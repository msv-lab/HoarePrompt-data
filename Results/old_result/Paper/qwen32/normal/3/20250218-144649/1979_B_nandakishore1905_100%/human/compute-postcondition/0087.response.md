Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), the state remains as described. If `k` is not a power of 2 and is odd, the state remains as described. If `k` is not a power of 2 and is even, `n` is set to 5, `m` is set to 0, `k` is set to 5, `l` is set to "11", `p` is set to 2, `q` is set to 2, and `f` is set to 1.**
