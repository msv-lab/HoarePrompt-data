Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `k` is defined as `abs(n - m)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., `k = abs(n - m)`.
- The values of `n` and `m` are not explicitly provided, but they are integers derived from the input.
- The absolute difference `abs(n - m)` will always result in a non-negative integer.
- The value of `i` being incremented by 1 does not affect the value of `k` or the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will output the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
