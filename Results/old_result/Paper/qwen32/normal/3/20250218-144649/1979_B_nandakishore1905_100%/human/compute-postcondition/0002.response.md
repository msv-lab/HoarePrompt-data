The value of `k` is assigned the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`**.
