The code snippet assigns the string `'04'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is an empty string; `h1` is `'04'`.**
