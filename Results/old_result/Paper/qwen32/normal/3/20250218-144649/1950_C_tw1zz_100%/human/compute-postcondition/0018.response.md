The variable `time` is assigned the string value 'AM'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time and its current value is '04'; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '04'; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'AM'.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is '04'; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '04'; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'AM'**.
