Let's break down the code execution step by step based on the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440.
- `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string.
- `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string.
- `m1` is the minute part of the input time.
- The values of `h1` and `time` are determined by the value of `h` as follows:
  - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is one of '02' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` is one of '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12 and `time` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - For all other values of `h` except the ones mentioned, `h1` remains '' and `time` remains ''.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement concatenates the values of `h1`, `':'`, `m`, `' '`, and `time` without any separators between them.

- **`h1`**: This is determined by the value of `h` as per the rules given above.
- **`':'`**: This is a literal colon.
- **`m`**: This is the minute part of the input time as a string.
- **`' '`**: This is a literal space.
- **`time`**: This is determined by the value of `h` as per the rules given above.

### Output:
The output will be a string that represents the time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM, derived from the given `h` and `m` values.

### Example Scenarios:
1. If `h` is '01' and `m` is '30':
   - `h1` is '01'
   - `time` is 'AM'
   - Output: **01:30 AM**

2. If `h` is '14' and `m` is '45':
   - `h1` is '2' (since 14 - 12 = 2)
   - `time` is 'PM'
   - Output: **2:45 PM**

3. If `h` is '12' and `m` is '00':
   - `h1` is '12'
   - `time` is 'PM'
   - Output: **12:00 PM**

4. If `h` is '00' and `m` is '15':
   - `h1` is '12'
   - `time` is 'AM'
   - Output: **12:15 AM**

### General Output:
Given the rules and the print statement, the output will be a 12-hour formatted time string with AM/PM, derived from `h` and `m`.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 and time are derived from the value of h as per the given rules)**
