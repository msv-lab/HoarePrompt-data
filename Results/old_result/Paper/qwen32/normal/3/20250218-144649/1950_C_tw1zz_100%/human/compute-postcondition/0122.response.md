Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `time` is a string. If `h` equals '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '14', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '15', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '16', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '17', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` (excluding '00', '06' to '23'), `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.**
