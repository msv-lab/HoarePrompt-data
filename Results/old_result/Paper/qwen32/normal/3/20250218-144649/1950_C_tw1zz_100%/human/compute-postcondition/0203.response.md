The code snippet assigns an empty string to `h1` and keeps the value of `m1` unchanged. The initial state provided specifies the conditions and values for `t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`, and `time`. After the execution of the code, `h1` becomes an empty string, and `m1` retains its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is ''; `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', and 'PM' if `h` is '12' or '13'.**
