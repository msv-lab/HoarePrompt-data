The code assigns the value of `m` to `m1` and sets `h1` to an empty string. The values of `t`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `h1` is an empty string; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.**
