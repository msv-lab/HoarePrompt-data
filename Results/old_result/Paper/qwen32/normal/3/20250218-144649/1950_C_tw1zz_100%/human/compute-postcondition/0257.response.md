Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains '' and `time` remains ''.**
