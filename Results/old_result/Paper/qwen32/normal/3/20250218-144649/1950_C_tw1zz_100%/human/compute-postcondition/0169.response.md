The variable `time` is assigned the string value `'PM'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is `'PM'`; `h1` is `'09'`.
