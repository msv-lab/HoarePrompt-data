### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which gives 15 cells per screen.
2. **Icon Sizes**: 
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.
3. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of screens required to place all icons.

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of three functions:
- `func_1(a, b)`: Returns the smaller of two integers. This function is not used anywhere in the code.
- `func_2()`: Handles the logic for a single test case.
- `func_3()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_2()` for each.

Let's focus on `func_2()`:
1. **Reading Input**: `x` and `y` are read from the input.
2. **Handling Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: `x > 0` and `y > 0`
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons, but the logic seems incorrect.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This modifies `x`, but the logic is unclear and seems incorrect.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This calculates additional screens needed for the modified `x`, but the logic is unclear.
     - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens.
   - **Case 2**: `x == 0` and `y > 0`
     - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 3**: `x > 0` and `y == 0`
     - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 4**: `x == 0` and `y == 0`
     - `print(0)`: This correctly handles the case where no icons are present.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Case 1**: The logic for `x > 0` and `y > 0` is incorrect.
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This should be `math.ceil(y / 3)` because each screen can fit a maximum of 3 2x2 icons (4 cells each, 3 * 4 = 12 cells, 15 - 12 = 3 cells left).
   - The calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should account for the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in those remaining cells.
   - The logic for `bxsfory1` is unclear and incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Screens for 2x2 Icons**: `math.ceil(y / 3)`
2. **Calculate Remaining Cells**: `(screens_for_2x2 * 15) - (y * 4)`
3. **Calculate Screens for 1x1 Icons**: `math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)`, but only if `remaining_cells` is less than `x`.

#### Verification:
Let's verify with the test case `x = 1`, `y = 3`:
- **Screens for 2x2 Icons**: `math.ceil(3 / 3) = 1`
- **Cells Occupied by 2x2 Icons**: `3 * 4 = 12`
- **Remaining Cells**: `15 - 12 = 3`
- **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**: `math.ceil((1 - 3) / 15) = 0` (since `1 - 3 = -2`, which means no additional screens are needed)

Thus, the total screens needed is `1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
