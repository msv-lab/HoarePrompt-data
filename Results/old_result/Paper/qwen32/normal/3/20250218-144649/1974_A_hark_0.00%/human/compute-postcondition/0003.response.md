The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. The loop depends on the variable `t` to determine how many times it should iterate. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, as the loop iterates `t` times and `_` does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99**
