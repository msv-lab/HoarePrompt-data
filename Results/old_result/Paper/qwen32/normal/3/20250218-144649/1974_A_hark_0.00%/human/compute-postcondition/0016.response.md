Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` and `y` remains the same, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is `0` if `x` <= 0 else `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
