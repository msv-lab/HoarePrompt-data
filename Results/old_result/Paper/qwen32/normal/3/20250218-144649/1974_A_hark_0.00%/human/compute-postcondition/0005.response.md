The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer input such that `0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4`. This means that before the current iteration started, `t` was one more than its current value. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 so that the loop condition `for _ in range(t)` still holds true.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one more than its current value (since it gets decremented at the start of the loop).

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99**
