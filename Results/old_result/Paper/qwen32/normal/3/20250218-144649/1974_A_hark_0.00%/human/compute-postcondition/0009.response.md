Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 99) by calling `func_2`. The overall effect is that for each test case, some action is performed (as defined in `func_2`), although the specific action is not detailed in the provided code.**
