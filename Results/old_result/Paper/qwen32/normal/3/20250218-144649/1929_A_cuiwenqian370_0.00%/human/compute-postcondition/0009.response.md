The code snippet appends the element at index `left` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Given that `left` is initialized to 0, the first element of `arr` will be appended to `new_arr`.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`; `left` is not equal to `right`

After the code execution, `new_arr` will have two elements: the largest element of `arr` (which was already in `new_arr`), and the first element of `arr` (which is `arr[0]`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and `arr[0]`; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`; `left` is not equal to `right`**
