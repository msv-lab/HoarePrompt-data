The `while` loop condition is `left <= right`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`
- If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the element at index `left` of `arr`, and both `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n - 1`
- Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the largest element of `arr` and `arr[0]`, `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`. Here are the possible scenarios:

1. If `left` equals `right`, we need to adjust `left` or `right` so that `left` is less than `right`.
2. If `left` is not equal to `right`, the loop can already execute one more time.

Since the problem specifies that the loop can certainly execute one more time if it is not already in the final state (`left` equals `right`), we can assume that the loop is not in the final state.

Thus, no adjustment is needed if `left` is not equal to `right`. If `left` equals `right`, we can adjust either `left` or `right` to ensure `left` is less than `right`.

Given the information, we can repeat the state as it is because the problem states that the loop can certainly execute one more time, which implies that `left` is not equal to `right` in the current state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the element at index `left` of `arr`, and both `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n - 1`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the largest element of `arr` and `arr[0]`, `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`**
