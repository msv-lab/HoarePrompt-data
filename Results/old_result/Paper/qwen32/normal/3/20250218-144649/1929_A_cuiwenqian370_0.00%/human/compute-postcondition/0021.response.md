The code snippet appends the element at index `left` of the list `arr` to a new list `new_arr`. Given the initial state, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, and `left` and `right` remain unchanged unless they were equal, in which case `left` is adjusted to be less than `right`. However, the adjustment of `left` and `right` is not relevant to the execution of this specific line of code.

The only change is that `new_arr` now contains the element at index `left` of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, adjust such that `left` is less than `right`. Otherwise, no adjustment needed. `new_arr` contains the element at index `left` of `arr`.**
