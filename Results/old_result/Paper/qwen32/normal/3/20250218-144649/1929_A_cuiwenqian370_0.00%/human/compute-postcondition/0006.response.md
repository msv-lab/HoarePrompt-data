The code appends the element at index `left` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Given that `left` is either `0` or `n-1`, and `arr` is a sorted list, the element appended to `new_arr` will be either the smallest or the largest element of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is a list containing the element at index `left` of `arr`; `left` is equal to `right`, and both are equal to 0 or `n - 1`.**
