### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. The given algorithm sorts the array and then rearranges it such that the elements alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This rearrangement strategy aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down the logic of the provided function `func_1`:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This helps in easily accessing the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: The array is rearranged such that the elements alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This is done using two pointers (`left` and `right`) that start from the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively, and move towards each other. Elements are appended to a new array (`new_arr`) in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on.
3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**: The maximum beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array (`new_arr`).

The approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the key to solving the problem optimally. The provided example cases and their explanations support the correctness of this approach.

### Correctness:

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic seems sound and correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array. The rearrangement method ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the goal of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.

**Correctness: True**
