To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what it does. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, it updates `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Given the initial state and the state after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate until `i` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n`, and the loop will have finished executing. At this point, `left` will be greater than `right`, indicating that the loop has terminated, and `right` will be one less than `left`.

The value of `max_beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from `new_arr[0]` to `new_arr[n-1]`.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` will be greater than `right`, indicating that the loop has finished executing; `right` will be one less than `left`; `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from `new_arr[0]` to `new_arr[n-1]`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `new_arr` will have the elements of `arr` rearranged in the specified order, the loop variables `left` and `right` will indicate that the loop has completed, and `max_beauty` will reflect the total "beauty" calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
