### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the function summary. We will focus on verifying whether the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements after sorting.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. By sorting the array and then rearranging it to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements, we aim to maximize these differences.

#### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1`:
1. Sorts the array.
2. Rearranges the array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
3. Computes the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

#### Program Analysis
Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided test cases and the function summary.

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - New Array: `[3, 1, 2]` (The program rearranges it this way, but `[1, 3, 2]` is also correct)
   - Beauty: `(3-1) + (2-1) = 2 + 1 = 3` (Incorrect, should be `[1, 3, 2]` giving `(3-1) + (2-3) = 2`)
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program incorrectly outputs `3` for this case. The correct arrangement should be `[1, 3, 2]` to achieve the maximum beauty of `2`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - New Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - New Array: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]` (The program rearranges it this way, but `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` is also correct)
   - Beauty: `(100-43) + (90-43) + (54-43) + (80-54) = 57 + 47 + 11 + 26 = 141` (Incorrect, should be `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` giving `57`)
   - Expected Output: `57`
   - The program incorrectly outputs `141` for this case. The correct arrangement should be `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` to achieve the maximum beauty of `57`.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - New Array: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(4-3) + (3-3) + (3-3) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - New Array: `[2, 1]`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

#### Conclusion
The program incorrectly calculates the maximum beauty for some test cases. Specifically, it does not always produce the correct rearrangement that maximizes the beauty. For example, in the first and third test cases, the program does not produce the correct alternating sequence to achieve the maximum beauty.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
