To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `left <= right`. The variables `left` and `right` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the task requirements.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n - 1`.

The loop condition `left <= right` should be true for the loop to execute. Initially, `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `right` will be at least 1, making the condition `0 <= n - 1` always true.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`**
