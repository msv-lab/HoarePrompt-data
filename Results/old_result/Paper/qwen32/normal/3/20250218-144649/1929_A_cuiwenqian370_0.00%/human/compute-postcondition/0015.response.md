The code snippet appends the element at index `right` of `arr` to `new_arr`. Given the initial state, `new_arr` already contains either the largest element of `arr` and `arr[0]` (if `left` is not equal to `right`), or the element at index `left` of `arr` (if `left` equals `right`). After appending `arr[right]` to `new_arr`, `new_arr` will have one more element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the element at index `left` of `arr` and the element at index `right` of `arr`, and both `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n - 1`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the largest element of `arr`, `arr[0]`, and the element at index `right` of `arr`, `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`.**
