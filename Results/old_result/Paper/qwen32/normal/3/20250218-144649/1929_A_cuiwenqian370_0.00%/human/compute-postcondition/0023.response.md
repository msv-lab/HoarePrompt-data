The code appends the element `arr[left]` to the list `new_arr`. Since `new_arr` initially contains only the element `arr[right]`, after the operation, `new_arr` will contain two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, adjust such that `left` is less than `right`. Otherwise, no adjustment needed. `new_arr` is a list that contains the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.**
