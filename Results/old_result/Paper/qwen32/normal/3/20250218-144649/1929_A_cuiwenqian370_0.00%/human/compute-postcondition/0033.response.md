The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

The state of `new_arr`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and other variables are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` and `right` are not yet compared, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`**.
