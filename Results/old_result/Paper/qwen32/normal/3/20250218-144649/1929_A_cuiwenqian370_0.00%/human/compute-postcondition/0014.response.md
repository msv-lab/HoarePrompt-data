Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the element at index `left` of `arr`, and both `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n - 1`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the largest element of `arr` and `arr[0]`, `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`. `new_arr` now includes `arr[left]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `n` remains the same integer between 2 and 100, `arr` remains the sorted list of integers, and `new_arr` now includes an additional element, which is `arr[left]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
