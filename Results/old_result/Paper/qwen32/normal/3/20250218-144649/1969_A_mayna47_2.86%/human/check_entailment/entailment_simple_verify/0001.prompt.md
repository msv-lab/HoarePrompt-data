You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. If `n` equals 2, the program does not perform any additional actions beyond maintaining the initial conditions. Otherwise, the loop has completed all `n` iterations without printing anything.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Summary:
Monocarp wants to throw a party and needs at least two of his friends to attend. Each friend has a distinct best friend, and a friend will only attend the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least two friends come to the party.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`, the number of friends, `n`, is read, followed by the list of best friends, `p`.
4. If `n == 2`, the program immediately prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure both attend.
5. For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet is found, it prints `2` and exits the function.
6. If no such triplet is found, the program prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case `n == 2`:** This is handled correctly. Both friends must be invited to ensure both attend, so the program correctly prints `2`.
- **Case `n > 2`:** The program checks for a specific condition: `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition identifies a cycle of length 3 in the best-friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure that both attend the party, so the program correctly prints `2`.
- **No cycle of length 3:** If no such cycle is found, the program assumes that the minimum number of invitations required is `3`. This is based on the assumption that in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the best strategy is to invite three friends. However, this assumption is not necessarily correct for all configurations. For example, consider a configuration where there are two disjoint cycles of length 2, such as `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. In this case, inviting two friends (one from each cycle) would be sufficient, but the program would incorrectly print `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible configurations correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that if there is no cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required is `3`. Therefore, the program is not always correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
