The provided initial state and the code snippet do not contain any variables or conditions that would affect the output of the `print(3)` statement. The `print(3)` statement is a direct print of the integer `3`.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive.
- `n` is an integer input by the user between 2 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, and no integer in the list is equal to its index.
- `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input.
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations without printing anything.

None of these variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `v`) are used in the `print(3)` statement. The `print(3)` statement simply outputs the integer `3`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(3)` statement will be:
Output: **3**
