### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic. Let's break it down again and validate the reasoning:

1. **Case `n == 2`:**
   - The program correctly prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure both attend. This part is correct.

2. **Case `n > 2`:**
   - The program checks if there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition identifies a cycle of length 3 in the best-friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure that both attend the party, so the program correctly prints `2`.

3. **No cycle of length 3:**
   - The program assumes that if no such cycle is found, the minimum number of invitations required is `3`. This is based on the assumption that in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the best strategy is to invite three friends. However, this assumption is not necessarily correct for all configurations.
   - For example, consider a configuration where there are two disjoint cycles of length 2, such as `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. In this case, inviting two friends (one from each cycle) would be sufficient, but the program would incorrectly print `3`.

The critical flaw identified in the original assessment is valid. The program does not handle configurations with multiple disjoint cycles of length 2 correctly. Therefore, the program is not always correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
