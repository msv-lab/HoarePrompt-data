### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Understanding:**
- Monocarp needs at least 2 friends at his party.
- Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i` such that `p_i != i` and all `p_i` are distinct.
- A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

**Key Observations:**
1. If `n = 2`, then Monocarp must invite both friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. This is because the only two friends are each other's best friends, and both need invites to attend.
2. If `n > 2`, Monocarp can potentially achieve this with fewer than `n` invitations. Specifically, if there is a triplet of friends `i`, `p_i`, and `p_{p_i}` such that `p_{p_{p_i}} = i`, then inviting `i` and `p_i` is sufficient for both `i` and `p_i` to attend the party.
3. If no such triplet exists, then Monocarp needs to invite at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program first checks if `n = 2`. If true, it correctly prints `2` because both friends must be invited.
- For `n > 2`, the program iterates through each friend `i` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If this condition is met for any `i`, it means there is a triplet of friends as described above, and the program correctly prints `2`.
- If the loop completes without finding such a triplet, the program prints `3`, which is correct because in this case, Monocarp needs to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
