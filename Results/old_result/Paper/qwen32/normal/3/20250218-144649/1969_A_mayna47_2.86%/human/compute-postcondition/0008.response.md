The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print(2)
```

The `print` statement is printing the integer value `2`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `v`) and their constraints, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the value `2`.

Output: **2**
