You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:

    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. The loop has completed all `n` iterations without printing anything.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. If `n` equals 2, the program does not perform any additional actions beyond maintaining the initial conditions. Otherwise, the loop has completed all `n` iterations without printing anything.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed for more complex scenarios beyond the simple cases it checks.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The function `func_1()` is supposed to determine the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.
2. It first checks if `n == 2`, and if so, it prints `2` because both friends must be invited.
3. For `n > 2`, it checks if there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet exists, it prints `2` because inviting `i` and `v[i]` will bring both `i` and `v[i]` to the party.
4. If no such triplet is found, it defaults to printing `3`.

However, this approach is not comprehensive. There are cases where the minimum number of invitations needed is more than `2` or less than `3` depending on the structure of the best friend relationships.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
In this case, no friend is their own best friend's best friend's best friend, so the code will print `3`. However, the correct answer is `2` because inviting friends `1` and `2` will bring both `1` and `2` to the party (since `1`'s best friend is `2` and `2`'s best friend is `1`).

Another example:
```
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
Here, no triplet `i`, `v[i]`, `v[v[i]]` satisfies `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. The code will print `3`. However, the correct answer is `2` because inviting friends `1` and `2` will bring both `1` and `2` to the party (since `1`'s best friend is `2` and `2`'s best friend is `3`).

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
