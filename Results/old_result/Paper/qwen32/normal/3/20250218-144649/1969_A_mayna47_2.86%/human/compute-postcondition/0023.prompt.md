You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. The loop has completed all `n` iterations without printing anything.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. If `n` equals 2, the program does not perform any additional actions beyond maintaining the initial conditions. Otherwise, the loop has completed all `n` iterations without printing anything.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It performs some operations based on the given constraints for `t`, `n`, and `p`, but it does not return any value in any of the specified cases (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing (None)

Case_2: The program returns without any value.

Case_3: The program returns without any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
