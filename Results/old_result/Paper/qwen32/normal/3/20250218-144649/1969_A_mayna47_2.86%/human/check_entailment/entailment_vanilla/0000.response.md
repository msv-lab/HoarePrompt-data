Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding
Monocarp wants to invite his friends to a party such that at least 2 friends come. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p[i]`, and a friend `i` will come to the party only if both `i` and `p[i]` receive invitations. The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Key Observations
1. **Cycles in the Friendship Graph**: The problem can be visualized as a directed graph where each friend points to their best friend. Since all `p_i` are distinct and `p_i != i`, this forms a collection of disjoint cycles.
2. **Cycle Lengths**:
   - If there is a cycle of length 2, Monocarp needs to invite both friends in the cycle, which requires 2 invitations.
   - If there is a cycle of length greater than 2, Monocarp needs to invite at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 come to the party. This is because inviting any two friends in a cycle of length greater than 2 will not guarantee that both of them will have their best friends invited.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking for cycles of length 2 and then defaulting to 3 invitations if no such cycles are found.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of friends) and the list `p` of best friends.

2. **Handling Special Case**:
   - If `n == 2`, it directly prints 2 because the only possible configuration is a cycle of length 2.

3. **Checking for Cycles of Length 2**:
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` form a cycle of length 2 (i.e., `i` and `v[i]` are each other's best friends).
   - If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 and returns immediately.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If no cycles of length 2 are found, the program defaults to printing 3.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Cycle of Length 2**: The program correctly identifies cycles of length 2 and returns 2 invitations, which is optimal.
- **Cycle of Length Greater than 2**: The program defaults to 3 invitations if no cycles of length 2 are found. This is also correct because in any cycle of length greater than 2, at least 3 invitations are needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description. It efficiently checks for cycles of length 2 and defaults to 3 invitations otherwise, ensuring that at least 2 friends come to the party with the minimum number of invitations.

**Correctness: True**
