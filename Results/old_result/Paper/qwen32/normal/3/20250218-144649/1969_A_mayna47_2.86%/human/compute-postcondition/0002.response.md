The code snippet `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, and then prepends a `0` to this list. The variable `v` is updated to this new list.

Given that `v` was initially a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to `0`, after the code execution, `v` will be a list starting with `0` followed by the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input.**
