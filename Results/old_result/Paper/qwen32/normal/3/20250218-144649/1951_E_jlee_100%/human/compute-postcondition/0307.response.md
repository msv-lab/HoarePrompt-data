The `print(string)` statement will print the `string` variable, which is the new user's input. The initial state does not specify the exact content of the `string`, only that it is the input provided by the user. Therefore, the output cannot be determined precisely without the specific input value.

Given the information, the output will be the exact value of the `string` variable as provided by the user.

Output: **string (where string is the new user's input)**
