The provided initial state mentions that `j` is `j + 1` and `n` is greater than 0. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`, which means it will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `j` and `n`.

Let's break it down:
- The value of `j` is described as `j + 1`, but since `j` is not used in the `print` statement, its value does not affect the output.
- The condition `n > 0` is also provided, but `n` is not used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output either.

Given the `print(1)` statement, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
