To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `done` is `False`
2. `count` is `0`
3. `count2` is `0`
4. `i` is `t + 1` (where `t` is not defined in the initial state, but it doesn't affect the print statement)
5. `string` is the new user's input
6. `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`
7. `n` is the length of the new list `s`
8. `x` is the first character of the new `string`
9. If `n` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
10. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the print statement, so it will be printed regardless of the values of `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, or `x`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
