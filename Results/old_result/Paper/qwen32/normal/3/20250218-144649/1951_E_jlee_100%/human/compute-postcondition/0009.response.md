Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, and `done` is False. If `n` equals 1, the condition is evaluated but no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, or `done`.**
