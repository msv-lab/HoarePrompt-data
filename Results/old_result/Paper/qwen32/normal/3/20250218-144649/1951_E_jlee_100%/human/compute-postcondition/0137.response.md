To determine the output of the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
4. `string` is the input string.
5. `n` is greater than 0, presumably the length of the string `string`.
6. `j` is initialized to 2.
7. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
8. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken.
9. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
- The code snippet provided is a simple `print('YES')` statement, which means it will print "YES" regardless of the conditions described unless it is inside a loop or if statement that prevents it from executing.
- The conditions mentioned (related to `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, and `done`) do not affect the `print('YES')` statement directly unless they are part of a control structure (like an `if` statement or `while` loop) that would prevent the `print` statement from executing.
- Since the `print('YES')` statement is not inside any control structure that could prevent its execution based on the provided conditions, it will execute and print "YES".

### Conclusion:
Given that the `print('YES')` statement is not inside any control structure that could prevent its execution based on the provided conditions, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
