Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes the variable `done` to `False`. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`) are affected by this code.
