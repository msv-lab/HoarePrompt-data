Output State: **`done` is `True`; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is less than `count`; `i` is `t + 1`; `string` is the new user's input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is the first character of the new `string`. The most internal loop or if statement was broken out of because `count` is greater than 0. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the most internal loop or if statement to be exited. All other variables retain their initial values.
