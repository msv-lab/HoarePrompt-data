Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. `i` remains equal to `t`. `string` remains the user's input. `s` remains a list of characters from `string`. `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `j` is incremented by 1. `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
