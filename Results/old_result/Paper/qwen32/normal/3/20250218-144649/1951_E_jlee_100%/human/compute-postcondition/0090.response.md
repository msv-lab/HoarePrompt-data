Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is set to 0.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
4. `string` is the input string.
5. `n` is greater than 0.
6. `count2` is either 0 or 1.
7. `j` is set to 1.
8. There are conditional statements that modify `count` and `done` based on the values of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`.

### Conditional Statements:
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken out of.
- Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `count2`, `j`, `count`, or `done`. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the conditions or values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
