The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The value `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
- None of the variables `done`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or `j` are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
