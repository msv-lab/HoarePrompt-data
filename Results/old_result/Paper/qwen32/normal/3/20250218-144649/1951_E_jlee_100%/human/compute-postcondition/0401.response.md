Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `count` remains `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. If `count > 0`, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count2 < count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count2 >= count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is not greater than 1 and `count2` is not greater than `count`, `count2` is set to 0.**
