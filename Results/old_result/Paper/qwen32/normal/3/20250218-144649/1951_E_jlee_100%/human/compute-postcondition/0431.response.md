Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to `j`. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
