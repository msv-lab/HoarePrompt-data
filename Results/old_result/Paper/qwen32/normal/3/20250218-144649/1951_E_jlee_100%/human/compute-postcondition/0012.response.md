The given initial state sets up several variables and conditions, but the `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables or conditions for its output. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
3. The variable `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
4. The variable `string` is the input string.
5. The variable `n` is the length of the list `s`.
6. The variable `done` is initialized to False.
7. The variable `x` is the first character of the string `string`.
8. The condition that the first character of `string` (`x`) is not equal to the last character of `string` (`s[-1]`) is given.

Despite all these variables and their conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print 'YES' regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
