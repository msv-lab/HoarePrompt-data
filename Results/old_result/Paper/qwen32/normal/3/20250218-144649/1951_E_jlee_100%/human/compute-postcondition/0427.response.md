To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the operations performed on the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `j` is updated to `j + 2`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `done` is set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is incremented by 2 from its original value. However, the original value of `j` is not provided, so we will refer to the updated `j` as `j + 2`.
- The variable `n` is a positive integer, indicating the length of the string `s`.
- The variable `done` is a boolean that changes based on the comparison of characters at positions `j` and `n - 1 - j` in the string `s`.
- The variable `count` is set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Explanation:
- `string[:j]` will print the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will print the substring from index `j` to the end of the string.

### Output:
The output will be the concatenation of two substrings:
1. The first substring is from the start of the string to just before the index `j`.
2. The second substring is from the index `j` to the end of the string.

Since the exact value of `j` and the string `s` (or `string`) are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `j`.

Output: **string[:j], string[j:] (where j is the updated value of j, which is the original j + 2)**
