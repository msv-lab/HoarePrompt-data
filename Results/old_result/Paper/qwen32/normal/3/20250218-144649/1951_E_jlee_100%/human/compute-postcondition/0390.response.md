Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` remains `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True. If `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, detailing the conditions and changes to the variables `j`, `n`, `count`, `done`, and `count2` based on the given logic.
