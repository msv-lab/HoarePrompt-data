Postcondition: **`done` is `False`, `count` is the position of the first character not equal to `x` (or `0` if all characters are `x`), `count2` is the number of `x` characters after the first non-`x` character, `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the user's input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, and `x` is the first character of `string`. The condition `not done` is true.**
