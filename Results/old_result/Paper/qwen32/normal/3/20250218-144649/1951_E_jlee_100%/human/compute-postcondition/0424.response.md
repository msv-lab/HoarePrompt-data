Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `count` is set to `j`. If `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is set to 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering all the conditions and the changes made to the variables in both the if and else parts.
