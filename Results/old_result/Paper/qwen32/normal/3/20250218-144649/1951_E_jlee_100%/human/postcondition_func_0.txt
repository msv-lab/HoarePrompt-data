The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters and determines if the string can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the concatenation of these substrings is not a palindrome. It prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings if such a split is possible; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
