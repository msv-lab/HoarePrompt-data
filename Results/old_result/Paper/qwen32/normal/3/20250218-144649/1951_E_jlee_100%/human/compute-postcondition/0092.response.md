Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `count2` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`j` is 1**: This means that `string[:j]` will give the substring from the start of the string up to (but not including) the character at index `j`, which is the first character of the string.
2. **`string[:j]`**: This will be the substring from the start of the string up to the character at index 1, which is just the first character of the string.
3. **`string[j:]`**: This will be the substring from the character at index `j` (which is 1) to the end of the string.

### Example:
If the input string `string` is "hello", then:
- `string[:j]` would be "h".
- `string[j:]` would be "ello".

### Output:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be the first character of the string and the rest of the string.

Output: **h ello (where 'h' is the first character of the input string and 'ello' is the rest of the input string)**

However, to make it more precise and general:

Output: **string[0] string[1:] (where string[0] is the first character of the input string and string[1:] is the rest of the input string)**
