Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`s`**: A list of characters from the input string `string`.
4. **`string`**: The input string.
5. **`n`**: Greater than 0 (specifically, the length of the string `string`).
6. **`done`**: A boolean variable that is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for some `j`, otherwise it remains False.
7. **`count2`**: Initially set to 0.
8. **`count`**: Greater than 1.
9. **`s[j]`**: Not equal to `x`.
10. **`count2`**: Equal to `count`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Analysis:
- **`string[:j - 1]`**: This slice will take all characters from the beginning of the string up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
- **`string[j - 1:]`**: This slice will take all characters from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

### Key Points:
- The exact value of `j` is not provided, but we know that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is equal to `count`, which is greater than 1.
- The variable `j` is crucial for determining the slices, but without its exact value, we can only describe the slices in terms of `j`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output two substrings of the input string `string`:
- The first substring is from the start of the string up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
- The second substring is from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we describe the output in terms of `j`.

### Final Output:
Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:] (where j is the index such that s[j] is not equal to x)**
