The `print(1)` statement in the provided code snippet will simply print the integer `1`. This is because the `print` function is directly instructed to output the value `1`, and this value does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`) and their values or relationships.
2. The `print(1)` statement is independent of these variables; it explicitly tells Python to output the number `1`.

Thus, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
