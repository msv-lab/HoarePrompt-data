The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement is independent of the initial state and the conditions described. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these directly influence the `print(2)` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement is a direct output of the number `2` and does not depend on any variable or condition defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
