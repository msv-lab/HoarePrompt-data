Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `count2` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is 1.
- The conditions describe some logic that modifies the `count` variable and a `done` variable based on the characters in the string `s`.

### Provided Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `count2`, `j`, `count`, or `done`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is `'YES'`, and it is not influenced by the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
