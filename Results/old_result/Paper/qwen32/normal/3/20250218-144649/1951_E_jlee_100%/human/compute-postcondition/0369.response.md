The given initial state describes the operation `j = j + 1` and that `n` is greater than 0. However, the print statement does not involve any of these variables. The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` exactly as it is, without any dependency on the variables `j` or `n`.

Output: **YES**
