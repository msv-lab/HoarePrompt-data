Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`.
4. `string` is the input string.
5. `n` is greater than 0.
6. `done` is a boolean variable that is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for any `j`, otherwise `done` remains `False`.
7. `count2` is initialized to 0.
8. The current value of `count` is greater than 1.
9. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
10. `count2` is equal to `count`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
