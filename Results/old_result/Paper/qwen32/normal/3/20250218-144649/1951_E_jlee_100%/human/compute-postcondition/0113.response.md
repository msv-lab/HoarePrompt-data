Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and the loop is broken. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and the loop is broken. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is reset to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the loop is broken. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
