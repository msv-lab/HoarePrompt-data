The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, none of the variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the new user's input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new list `s`, and `x` is the first character of the new `string`.**
