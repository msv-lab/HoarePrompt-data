Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is the user's input integer. `a` is the user's input. `b` is the user's input. `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged). `no_path` is `False` because at least one `b[k]` (where `k` is even and `0 ≤ k < n`) is not equal to '>'; the current state is that `not no_path` is `True`.**
