Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is an input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>'. `no_path` is `True`.**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` was initially `False`, but the code snippet sets `no_path` to `True`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
