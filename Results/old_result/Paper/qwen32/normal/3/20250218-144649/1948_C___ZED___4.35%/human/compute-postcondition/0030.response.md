To determine the output of the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the value of `k` at the point of execution.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **n**: An integer that is at least 3.
3. **a**: A string.
4. **b**: A string with the second-to-last character '>'.
5. **k**: The value of `k` from the previous iteration plus 2.
6. **no_path**: Determined by the character at index `k` in `a`.

### Key Information:
- The value of `k` is dependent on its value from the previous iteration plus 2.
- Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `k`, we can only describe `k` based on its iterative definition.

### Analysis:
- The value of `k` is not explicitly given, but we know it is incremented by 2 from its previous value.
- Therefore, the value of `k` could be any integer that satisfies the pattern described (i.e., it is incremented by 2 from the previous value).

### Output:
Since we do not have the initial value of `k` and only know that it is incremented by 2 in each iteration, we can describe `k` as `k (where k is the value from the previous iteration plus 2)`.

Output: **k (where k is the value from the previous iteration plus 2)**
