Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns "YES" if it is possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that each pair is either in the same string and non-overlapping, or one is in the first string and the other is in the second string directly below it. Otherwise, it returns "NO".**
