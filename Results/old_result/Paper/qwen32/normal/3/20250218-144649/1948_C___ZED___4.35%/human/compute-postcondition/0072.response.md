Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `n` is an integer greater than 2.
  - `a` is the new input string.
  - `b` is the new input string.
  - `i` is `i + 1` (This suggests that `i` is being incremented, but its initial value is not specified).
  - `k` is 3.
  - `no_path` is unchanged based on the loop body condition.

- **Print Statement:**
  ```python
  print(k)
  ```

From the initial state, we know that `k` is explicitly set to 3. The value of `k` does not depend on any other variables or conditions provided in the initial state. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the value of `k`.

Output: **3**
