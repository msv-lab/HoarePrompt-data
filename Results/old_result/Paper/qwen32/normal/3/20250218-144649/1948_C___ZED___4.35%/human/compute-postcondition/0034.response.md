To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `n` is an integer that is at least 3.
3. `a` is a string.
4. `b` is a string with the second-to-last character '>'.
5. `k` is the value of `k` from the previous iteration plus 4.
6. `no_path` is False if `a[k]` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains unchanged.

Given this information, we can infer the following:

- The value of `k` is dependent on its value from the previous iteration. Since the exact value of `k` from the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote it as `k_prev`.
- According to the initial state, `k` is calculated as `k_prev + 4`.

However, the exact value of `k_prev` is not provided, so we can't determine a specific numerical value for `k`. Nonetheless, we can express `k` in terms of `k_prev`.

The `print(k)` statement will output the current value of `k`, which is `k_prev + 4`.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **k (where k is the value of k from the previous iteration plus 4)**
