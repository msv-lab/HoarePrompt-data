To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 2.
3. `a` is the user's input.
4. `b` is the user's input.
5. `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged, which implies `i` was previously defined and its value is not explicitly given here).
6. `k` is `i + 4`.

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is described as `i + 2` (unchanged), it implies that `i` has a specific value before this point, but that value is not given in the initial state. However, we know that `k` is defined as `i + 4`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly relevant to the calculation of `k` in this context.
- The only variable directly related to the output is `k`, which is defined in terms of `i`.

### Output Calculation:
- The value of `k` is `i + 4`.
- Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only express `k` in terms of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is `i + 4`.

Output: **i + 4 (where i is the initial value of i)**
