The code snippet sets `no_path` to `False`. This change overrides the previous condition that set `no_path` based on the character at index `k` in string `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than `i + 5`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `i + 5`, and `no_path` is `False`.**
