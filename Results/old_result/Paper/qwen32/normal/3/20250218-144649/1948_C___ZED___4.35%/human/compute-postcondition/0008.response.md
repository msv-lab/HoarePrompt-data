The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` as long as they satisfy their respective conditions. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement because the string 'YES' is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables.

Output: **YES**
