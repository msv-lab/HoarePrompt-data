The code snippet sets `no_path` to `False`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is an input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>'. `no_path` is `False`. `k` is incremented by 2.**
