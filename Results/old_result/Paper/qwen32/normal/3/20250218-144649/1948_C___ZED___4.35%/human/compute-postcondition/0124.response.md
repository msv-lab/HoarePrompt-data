The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `no_path`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. **Determine the Output**: Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the output will be this exact string.

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `no_path` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of the `print('YES')` statement.

Output: **YES**
