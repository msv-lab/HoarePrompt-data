You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: A series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs, one for each test case, based on the conditions checked in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that the pairs are either within the same string and non-overlapping, or one is in the first string and the other is directly below it in the second string. The function outputs "YES" if such pairings are possible, otherwise "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify some issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if the second last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is '>', which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This check is too simplistic and does not consider the entire path the robot needs to take.
   
2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop `for k in range(0, n, 2)` checks only the even-indexed cells in the second row (`b`). This is not comprehensive enough to determine if the robot can navigate through the grid correctly.
   - Similarly, the loop `for k in range(1, n - 1, 2)` checks only the odd-indexed cells in the first row (`a`). This check is also too simplistic and does not consider the entire path the robot needs to take.

3. **Movement Logic:**
   - The program does not simulate the robot's movement in the grid. It only checks certain conditions without actually following the arrows and moving the robot step-by-step.
   - The logic for determining if there is no path (`no_path`) is flawed and does not cover all scenarios where the robot might be able to reach the target cell.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
>><<
```

For this input, the robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by following the path:
- Start at (1, 1)
- Move right to (1, 2)
- Follow the '>' arrow to (1, 3)
- Move down to (2, 3)
- Follow the '<' arrow to (2, 2)
- Move right to (2, 3)
- Follow the '<' arrow to (2, 2)
- Move right to (2, 3)
- Follow the '<' arrow to (2, 2)
- Move right to (2, 3)
- Follow the '<' arrow to (2, 2)
- Move right to (2, 3)
- Follow the '<' arrow to (2, 2)
- Move right to (2, 4)

However, the given program will incorrectly output "NO" for this input because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and pathfinding.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid accurately. Therefore, it is incorrect.
