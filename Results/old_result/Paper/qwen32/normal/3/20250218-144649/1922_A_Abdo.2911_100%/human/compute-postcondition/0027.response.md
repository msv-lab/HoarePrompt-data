Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `possible` is `True`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `possible`, and `i` remain as they were, except `i` is incremented by 1. We also exit the most internal loop or if statement.
