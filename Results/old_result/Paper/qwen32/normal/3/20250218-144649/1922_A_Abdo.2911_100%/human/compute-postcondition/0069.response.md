The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. In this context, it does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the next iteration of the loop will begin immediately. 

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the values of `possible`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only action is the continuation to the next iteration of the loop, but since we are asked to describe the output state based on the provided information, we will note that no changes have occurred to the variables.

Output State: **`possible` is `True` if `c[0]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `a[0]` equals `b[0]`. If `a[0]` does not equal `b[0]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[0]` is equal to either `a[0]` or `b[0]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 1. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
