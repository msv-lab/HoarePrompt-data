Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `_` is incremented by 1 and the loop is broken out of. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is `False` and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 if the loop is broken out of, and `t` is greater than the new value of `_`. `n` is greater than 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings with `i` being 2.**
