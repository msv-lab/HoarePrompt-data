The initial state describes a condition under which the variable `possible` is set to `True`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`, which does not depend on the value of `possible` or any other variables. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `possible` is set to `True` based on the given condition, but this does not affect the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`, which means it will print the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
