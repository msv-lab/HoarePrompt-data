The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if there exists at least one position `i` in the strings such that `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `c[i]` is not equal to both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
