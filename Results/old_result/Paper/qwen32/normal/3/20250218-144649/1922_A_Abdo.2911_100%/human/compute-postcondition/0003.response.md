The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `a` by reading an input string from the user and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. After executing the code, the value of `a` is updated to the newly provided input string, while `b` and `c` remain unchanged. The values of `t` and `n` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
