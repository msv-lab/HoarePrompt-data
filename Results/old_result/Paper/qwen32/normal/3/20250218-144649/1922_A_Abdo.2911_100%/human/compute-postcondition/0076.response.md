Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate immediately without changing the values of `possible`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. The only change is that the loop is exited.
