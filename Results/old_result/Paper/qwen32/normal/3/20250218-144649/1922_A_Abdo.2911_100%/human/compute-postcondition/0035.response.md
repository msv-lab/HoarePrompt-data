The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `True`. This does not affect any other variables provided in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `possible` is now `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `i` is `i + 1`, `possible` is `True`**.
