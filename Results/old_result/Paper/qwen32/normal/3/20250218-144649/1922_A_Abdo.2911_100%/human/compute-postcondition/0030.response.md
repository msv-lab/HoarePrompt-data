The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the loop statement, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is the string provided by the user input
- `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented in the previous iteration)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, so it should be `i + 1` from the current state.

State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `i` is `i + 1`**
