The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, or `possible`. It merely breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
