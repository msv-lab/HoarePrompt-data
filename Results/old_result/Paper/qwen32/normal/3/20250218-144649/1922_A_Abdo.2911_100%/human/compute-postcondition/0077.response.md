Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `possible` remains unchanged. `_` is incremented by 1 if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `t` is greater than the new value of `_` if `_` was incremented, `n` is greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, and `i` is 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged except for not breaking out of the loop.**
