The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable, and `testcases`. Since the underscore is not used in the loop head to control the loop, the only variable we can adjust is `testcases`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `testcases` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0. Since `testcases` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust it accordingly.

State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 1**.

However, to be more precise and ensure the loop can execute one more time, we should specify that `testcases` must be exactly 1 more than the current state after the decrement:

State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than or equal to 2**. 

This ensures that after decrementing by 1 in the current iteration, `testcases` will still be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
