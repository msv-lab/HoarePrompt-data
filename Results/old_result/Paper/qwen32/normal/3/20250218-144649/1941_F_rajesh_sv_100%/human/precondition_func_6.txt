n, m, and k are integers representing the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively, such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. A is a list of integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in ascending order, with length n and each element satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9. D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, with length m and each element satisfying 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. F is a list of integers representing the complexities of the functions, with length k and each element satisfying 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
