Output State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `func_6()` is executed, but there is no information provided about how `func_6()` affects the variable `testcases` or any other variables. Therefore, the value of `testcases` remains the return value of `func_3()` and it is still guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 2.
