Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` and `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`; otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
