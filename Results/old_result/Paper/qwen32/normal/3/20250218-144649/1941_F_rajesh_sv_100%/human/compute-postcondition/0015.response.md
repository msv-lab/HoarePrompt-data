Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined. If `diff` (which is `A[1] - A[0]`) is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`; otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains -inf.**
