You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It processes a number of test cases, which is determined by the value returned from `func_3()`. For each test case, it executes `func_6()`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that all test cases have been processed by executing `func_6()` the corresponding number of times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1` and `wrapper` are not used**: The functions `func_1` and `wrapper` are defined but never used in the program. They seem to be intended for memoization, but they are not integrated into the logic of the program.

2. **Binary Search Logic in `func_6` is incorrect**: The binary search logic in `func_6` is flawed. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the `l` and `h` pointers in the binary search loop is incorrect. The condition `if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` does not correctly determine the optimal position to insert the new problem complexity. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the new problem complexity is intended to minimize the imbalance, the current logic might not correctly identify the optimal insertion point. The program should consider cases where the new problem complexity could be inserted at the beginning, end, or between existing problems.

4. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `max_diff`, but this might not be the correct initial value in all cases. The program should consider the possibility that adding a new problem could result in an imbalance smaller than `max_diff`.

5. **Output Handling**: The program prints the result for each test case directly within the loop, which is correct, but the logic leading to this output might be flawed due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
