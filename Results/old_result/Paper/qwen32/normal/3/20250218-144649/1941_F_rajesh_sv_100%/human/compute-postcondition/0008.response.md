Functionality: **The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It returns a value based on the predefined number of test cases, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. However, since no specific return values or conditions are provided in the output description, the functionality is not fully defined. Assuming it processes a fixed number of test cases, it could return results or perform actions related to these test cases.**
