The given code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables influence the output of this specific print statement. The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, or `i`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print('Bodya')` statement directly outputs the string `'Bodya'`.
- None of the other variables or their values affect this output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
