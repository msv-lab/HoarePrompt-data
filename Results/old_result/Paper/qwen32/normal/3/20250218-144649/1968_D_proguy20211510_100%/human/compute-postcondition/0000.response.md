The provided code snippet only initializes two string variables `YES` and `NO` with the values `'YES'` and `'NO'`, respectively. None of the other variables in the initial state are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect these initialized values for `YES` and `NO`, while all other variables will retain their initial values.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and n (inclusive), and a is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'.**
