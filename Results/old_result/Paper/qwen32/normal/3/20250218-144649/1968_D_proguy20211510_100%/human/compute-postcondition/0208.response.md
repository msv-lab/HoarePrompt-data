The code snippet `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `pathb`. This means the list `pathb` will now have an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `ps` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes `a[pb - 1]` twice; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop; `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms: The list `pathb` now includes `a[pb - 1]` twice, while all other variables remain unchanged.
