The code snippet `vis = [0] * n` initializes the `vis` list with `n` elements, all set to 0. This means that any previous values in the `vis` list are discarded and replaced with a new list of zeros.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `ress` was greater than `resb`, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`.**
