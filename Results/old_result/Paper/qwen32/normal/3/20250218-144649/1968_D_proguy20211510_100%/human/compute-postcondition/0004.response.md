The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into four parts, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `int(input())` returns `t`. However, the given code does not use `t` in any way, so `t` remains unchanged.

After the execution of the code, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` will hold the values of the four parts of the input line, respectively. Since the input is split into strings, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` will be strings.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is a string, `k` is a string, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string**.
