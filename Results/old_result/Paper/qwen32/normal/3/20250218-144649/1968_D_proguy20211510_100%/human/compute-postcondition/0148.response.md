The code snippet provided updates the value of `curr` based on the existing values of `preb`, `pathb[i]`, `k`, and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected and must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, then `k` is less than `i + 1`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**.
