To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop iterates `n + 1` times, so `n` must be a non-negative integer. If `n` is -1 or less, the loop will not execute because `range(n + 1)` would be empty.

2. **Variable `j`:** The variable `j` is the loop counter, and it starts at 0 by default when the loop begins. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is non-negative and `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`j` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer**
