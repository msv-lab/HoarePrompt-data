The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `w`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `buffer` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.**
