Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, and `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `n` >= 3, `eta` contains all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` is the count of values in `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from `0` to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the computed sum of terms involving each `q[eta[j]]` and the cumulative `rho`. If `n` < 3, other variables remain unchanged.**
