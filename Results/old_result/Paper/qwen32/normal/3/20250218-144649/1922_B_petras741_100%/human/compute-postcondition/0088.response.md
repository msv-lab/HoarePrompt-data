Output State: **`eta` contains all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` must be greater than 2; `rho` is `rho + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[2]]`; `res` is updated to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + 2 * q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) * (q[eta[2]] - 2) // 6 + 2 * q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`; `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `rho` is incremented by `q[eta[j]]`, which is `q[eta[2]]` since `j` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
