The value of `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`eta` contains all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` must be greater than 1; `rho` is `rho + q[eta[j]]`; `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**
