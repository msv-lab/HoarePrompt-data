Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer and must be at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is the count of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta_ln` is the number of unique values in `w`, `rho` is the total count of all elements in `w`, `j` is 0. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the integer `0`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if statement, taking into account the condition `q[j] > 0`. If the condition is true, `eta` is updated to contain the integer `0`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.
