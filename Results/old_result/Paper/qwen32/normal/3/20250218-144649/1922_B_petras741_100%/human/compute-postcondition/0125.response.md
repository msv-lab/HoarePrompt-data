Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `buffer` is an empty list.
- `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting space-separated input values to integers.
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is the count of `w[j]` in `w`.
- `eta` is a list containing all unique values in `w`.
- `eta_ln` is the number of unique values in `w`.
- `rho` is the count of the first unique value in `w`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `eta_ln` is updated to be the length of `eta`.
- Additionally, `eta_ln` equals 1, indicating that all elements in `w` are the same.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements out of `n` elements without regard to the order. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), which is calculated as:
\[ \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot (n - 2)}{6} \]

Since `eta_ln` equals 1, it implies that all elements in the list `w` are the same. However, this does not directly affect the calculation of the combination formula. The value of `n` is what matters here.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the integer value of \( \binom{n}{3} \), which is the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `n` elements.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the number of elements in the list w)**
