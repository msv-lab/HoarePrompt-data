The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. 

Given the initial state, `j` is `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` (which is an integer such that `n >= 3` and `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`) is appended to the list `eta`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer such that n >= 3 (and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing the value `n`.**
