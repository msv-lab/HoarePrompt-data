The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given that `q` is initialized as a list of `n + 1` zeros, the value at `q[w[j]]` will be increased by 1, while all other elements in `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is incremented by 1.**
