You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a number of test cases, each with an integer input `lex`. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of three characters based on the value of `lex` and prints these characters. The characters are derived from the English alphabet, where values 1 through 26 correspond to 'a' through 'z', and values 27 through 52 would theoretically correspond to 'a' through 'z' again, but the function does not handle values above 52 correctly as per the given code. The final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters of the word).
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if `lex` (which is the encoded value) is less than or equal to 26:
     - If true, it appends `1` to `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52 but greater than 26, it appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is 52 or greater, it also appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the list `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - It then prints the corresponding characters for the values in `arr` by converting each value to a character using `chr(value + 96)` and printing them without a newline.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program aims to construct the lexicographically smallest word that could have produced the encoded value.
   - However, the logic for distributing the encoded value among the three letters is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles values of `lex` that are less than 52 by always appending `1` or `26` without considering the optimal distribution of the remaining value.
   - For example, if `lex` is `24`, the program will append `1` twice and then `22`, resulting in the word "aav". This is correct in this case, but for other values, the logic may not produce the lexicographically smallest word.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the remaining value after the first two letters is greater than 26 correctly. It should ensure that the remaining value is distributed in a way that results in the smallest possible third letter.

Given these issues, the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `lex`.
