Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is [26], `lex` is the integer value provided by the user and `lex` is greater than 0 but less than 26, `j` is 0, `k` is 3**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, so if it was originally between 27 and 51, it is now between 1 and 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
