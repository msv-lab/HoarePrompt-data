The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer `26` to the end of the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` can be one of four possible lists based on the value of `lex`. After appending `26`, the new state of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` was `[1, 1]` and becomes `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` was between 26 and 51, `arr` was `[26, 1]` and becomes `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If `lex` was 52 or greater, `arr` was either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]` and becomes `[1, 26, 26]` or `[26, 26, 26]` respectively.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `lex`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1, 26] if `lex` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 26, 26] if `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3**.
