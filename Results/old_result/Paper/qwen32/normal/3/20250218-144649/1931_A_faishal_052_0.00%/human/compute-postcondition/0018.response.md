The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the end of the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains a single element, which is either `1` or `26` depending on the value of `lex`. After appending `1` to `arr`, the list `arr` will now contain two elements.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `arr` is a list containing a single element, which is `1` if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or `26` if `lex` is greater than 25.
- `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26 if it is less than 52, or an integer greater than 51 if it is not.
- `j` is 1.

After executing the code, the only change is to `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or 26 if `lex` is greater than 25, and the second element is 1, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26 if it is less than 52, or an integer greater than 51 if it is not, `j` is 1.**
