The code snippet `lex = int(input())` assigns the value of `lex` to whatever integer is input by the user. The previous conditions on `lex` (being between 0 and 25, between -25 and 25, or greater than 51) are no longer relevant because the value of `lex` is now determined by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is the integer value provided by the user, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
