Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1, `lex` is the integer value provided by the user minus 1 and `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `j` is 0, `k` is 3.**

In simpler terms, the value of `lex` has been decreased by 1, so if the user initially provided a value for `lex` that was less than or equal to 26, it is now less than or equal to 25. All other variables retain their initial values.
