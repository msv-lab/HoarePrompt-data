The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`, `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
