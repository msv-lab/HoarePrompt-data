Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1] if `lex` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26] or [26, 26] if `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3.**
