In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `cases`. To ensure that the loop executes, `cases` must be at least 1. The variables `t`, `n`, and the loop body's contents do not directly influence whether the loop will execute; they are not part of the loop's head condition.

Let's break it down:

- The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 before the first iteration.
- The variable `cases` is the condition that determines the number of iterations.

Since `t` and `n` are not part of the loop's head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to make sense in the context of the problem, `cases` should be set to a value that allows the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `cases` is at least 1. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78**
