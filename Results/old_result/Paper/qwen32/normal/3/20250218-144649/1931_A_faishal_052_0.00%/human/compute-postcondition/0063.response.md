The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended to it, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended to it, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3.**
