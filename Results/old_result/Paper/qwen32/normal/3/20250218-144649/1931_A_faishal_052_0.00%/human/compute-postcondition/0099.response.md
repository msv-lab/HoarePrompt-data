The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given the initial condition that `26 < lex < 52`, after the operation, `0 < lex < 26`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer such that 0 < lex < 26, `j` is 0, `k` is 3.**
