The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` adjusts the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. Given the initial state, `lex` was adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater. After executing the code, `lex` will be further reduced by 26.

To determine the exact new value of `lex`:
- If `lex` was originally in the range 1 to 25, it was adjusted to be `lex - 1` (which means `lex` was 0 to 24 after adjustment). Subtracting 26 from these values would result in negative numbers, which is not possible given the constraints. Therefore, this scenario is not applicable.
- If `lex` was originally in the range 26 to 51, it was adjusted to be `lex - 27` (which means `lex` was -1 to 24 after adjustment). Subtracting 26 from these values would result in `lex` being -27 to -2, which is also not possible given the constraints. Therefore, this scenario is not applicable.
- If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, it was adjusted to be `lex - 27`. Subtracting 26 from these values would result in `lex` being 25 or greater.

Thus, after the execution of `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be `lex - 53` if it was originally 52 or greater.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26] if `lex + 26` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1, 26] if `lex + 26` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 26, 26] if `lex + 26` was 52 or greater, `lex` is adjusted to be `lex - 53` if it was originally 52 or greater, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.**
