To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement itself.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1 (also not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `i` is 1 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`.
- `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex` (the exact reduction is not specified, but it affects the sorting of `arr`).
- `j` is 2 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `k` is 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`. The exact values in `arr` are not provided, but we know it is sorted.
2. `k` is 1, so `arr[k]` refers to the second element in the list `arr` (since list indices start at 0).
3. The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
4. The integer used in the `chr` function is `arr[k] + 96`, which means we take the second element of `arr`, add 96 to it, and then convert the result to a character.

Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order and `k` is 1, `arr[k]` is the second smallest element in the list. Let's denote `arr[1]` as `second_element`. The character printed will be `chr(second_element + 96)`.

Given the constraints on `arr` and the fact that it is sorted in ascending order, the smallest possible value for `arr[1]` is 2 (since `arr[0]` is the smallest element and `arr` is sorted in ascending order, and the problem does not specify the exact values but implies they are positive integers). If `arr[1]` is 2, then `chr(2 + 96)` would be `chr(98)`, which is 'b'. However, without knowing the exact values of `arr`, we can only describe the output in terms of the second element of `arr`.

Output: **chr(arr[1] + 96) (where arr[1] is the second smallest element in the sorted list `arr`)**
