### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded value `n`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` (which is the encoded value `n`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two letters:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends `1` to `arr` (representing 'a') and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is less than 52 but greater than 26, it appends `26` to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - Otherwise, it appends `26` to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr` (which represents the position of the third letter).

3. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure that the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - It then converts each value in `arr` to the corresponding letter by adding 96 (since `chr(97)` is 'a') and prints the letters without any separator.

### Issues in the Logic:

- **Incorrect Handling of Values:**
  - The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. If `lex` is greater than 26, it should not immediately append `26` (representing 'z'). Instead, it should append the largest possible value that allows the remaining value to still be achievable with the third letter.
  - Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `lex` is exactly 3 correctly, as it should output "aaa".

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting the list `arr` is incorrect because it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest combination. The correct approach is to ensure that the first letter is as small as possible, then the second, and finally the third.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Determine the First Letter:**
   - Start with the smallest possible value for the first letter (1, representing 'a').
   - Reduce `lex` by this value and check if the remaining value can be split into two valid letters (each between 1 and 26).

2. **Determine the Second Letter:**
   - After determining the first letter, find the smallest possible value for the second letter.
   - Reduce `lex` by the sum of the first two letters and check if the remaining value is a valid letter (between 1 and 26).

3. **Determine the Third Letter:**
   - The remaining value of `lex` after determining the first two letters is the value for the third letter.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
