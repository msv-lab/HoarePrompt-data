The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` was either `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending `1`, `arr` will be either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1] if `lex` was greater than 26, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 26` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
