The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer `26` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` initially contains a single element, which is either `1` or `26` depending on the value of `lex`. After the `append` operation, `arr` will have two elements: the initial element and `26`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is either 1 or 26 and the second element is 26, `lex` is an integer such that if lex is less than or equal to 25, lex is between 1 and 25, if lex is greater than 25 and less than 52, lex is between 26 and 51, if lex is greater than 51, lex is greater than 51, `j` is 1**
