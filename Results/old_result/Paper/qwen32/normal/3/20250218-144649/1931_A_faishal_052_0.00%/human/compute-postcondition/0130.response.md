The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, but since the upper bound in the `range` function is exclusive, the loop will terminate after `k` is 2.

However, to adhere to the task of adjusting the state for the next iteration, we would increment `k` by 1, even though it will not result in another loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [lex, 1, 1], [1, lex, 26], [lex, 1, 26], [1, 26, lex], [lex, 26, 26], or [26, 26, lex] depending on the value of `lex`, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3**
