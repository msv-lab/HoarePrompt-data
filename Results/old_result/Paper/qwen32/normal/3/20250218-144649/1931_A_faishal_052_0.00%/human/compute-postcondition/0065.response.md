Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 26, `j` is 1, `k` is 3.**

In simple terms, the value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, while all other variables remain unchanged.
