Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(3):
    print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `k` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `k` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `k` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
