Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `k` retain their original values within the specified ranges. The `arr` will be either [1, 26] or [26, 26], and `lex` will be adjusted to be within the range 0 < `lex` < 26, taking into account whether it was originally less than 52 or 52 or greater.
