Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended if `lex` <= 26, or an additional 26 appended if `lex` > 26, and then an additional 26 appended, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 26 if `lex` <= 26, or minus 52 if `lex` > 26, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**

In simpler terms, the value of `lex` has been decreased by 26. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, it now becomes `lex - 26`, which is less than or equal to 0. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, it now becomes `lex - 26`, which is still greater than 0 but reduced by 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
