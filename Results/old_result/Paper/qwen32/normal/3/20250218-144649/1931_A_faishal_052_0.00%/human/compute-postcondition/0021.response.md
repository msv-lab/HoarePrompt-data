Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements, the first element is either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex`, and the second element is 26, `lex` is an integer between -25 and 25 if it was originally less than 52, otherwise greater than 25, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was originally less than 52, it will now be between -25 and 25. If `lex` was originally greater than 51, it will now be greater than 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
