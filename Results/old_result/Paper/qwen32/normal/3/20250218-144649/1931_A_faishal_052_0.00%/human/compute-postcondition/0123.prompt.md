Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is the integer input by the user, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26] if `lex` was greater than 26, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 26` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 0, `k` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1] if `lex` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26] or [26, 26] if `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 26, 1], [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on the original value of `lex`, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (either `lex - 2`, `lex - 28`, or `lex - 53`), `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` has a third element of 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, `arr` has a third element of 26. The adjusted `lex` is in the range -25 to 51.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
