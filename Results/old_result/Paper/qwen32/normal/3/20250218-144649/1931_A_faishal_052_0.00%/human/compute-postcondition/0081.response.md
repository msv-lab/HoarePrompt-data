The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial state, `arr` can be one of the following lists: `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, 26, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]`. After sorting, the list `arr` will be ordered with the smallest elements first.

Let's consider each possible initial configuration of `arr` and how it will look after sorting:

1. If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, after sorting it remains `[1, 1, lex]`.
2. If `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`, after sorting it becomes `[1, lex, 26]` if `lex > 1`, or `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex == 1`.
3. If `arr` is `[26, 1, lex]`, after sorting it becomes `[1, lex, 26]` if `lex > 1`, or `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex == 1`.
4. If `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`, after sorting it becomes `[lex, 26, 26]` if `lex < 26`, or `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex == 26`.

Since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, we can describe the sorted `arr` in terms of its possible configurations:

- If `lex <= 1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex]` or `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If `1 < lex < 26`, `arr` becomes `[1, lex, 26]`.
- If `lex >= 26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, lex]` or `[26, 26, 26]`.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `lex`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`, `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**
