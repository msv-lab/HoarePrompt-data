The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` of string `s` to the string `ans`. 

Given that `x` is 2, `ans` will be updated to `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an odd integer and must be at least 5; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`; `x` is 2; `j` is incremented by 1**.
