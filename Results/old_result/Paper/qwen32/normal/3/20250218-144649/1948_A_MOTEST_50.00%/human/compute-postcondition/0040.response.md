Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer; `x` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is not equal to 1; `ans` is an empty string; `j` is `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd and not equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1` if `n` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been reset to an empty string. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `i`) retain their initial values unless `n` is 1, in which case `x` and `j` would not have been set, and `i` would not have been incremented.
