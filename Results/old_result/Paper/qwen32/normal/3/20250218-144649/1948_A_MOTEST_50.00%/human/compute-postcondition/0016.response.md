The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Given that `x` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is even; `ans` is a string containing `s[x] * 4`; `x` is 2; `s` is undefined; `j` is 1**.
