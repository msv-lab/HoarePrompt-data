The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s`, repeated twice, to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 1, the character at index 1 of `s` is repeated twice and added to `ans`.

Initial State: `t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` must be at least 4 (so that `n // 2` is at least 2, allowing `j` to be incremented to 2); `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice; `x` is 1; `j` is 2

After the code execution, `ans` will be updated to include the character at index 1 of `s` repeated twice. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` must be at least 4 (so that `n // 2` is at least 2, allowing `j` to be incremented to 2); `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice; `x` is 1; `j` is 2**
