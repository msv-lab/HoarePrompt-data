Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We are given an integer \( x \).
- We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
- If multiple \( y \) values satisfy this condition, any of them is acceptable.

### Analysis of the Program:
The given program does the following:
- It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
- It calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \).
- It prints \( y \).

### Correctness Evaluation:
To determine if this program correctly solves the problem, we need to consider whether \( y = x // 2 \) always maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

#### Case 1: \( x \) is even
- Let \( x = 2k \) for some integer \( k \).
- Then \( y = x // 2 = k \).
- \( \gcd(2k, k) = k \).
- So, \( \gcd(2k, k) + k = k + k = 2k \).

#### Case 2: \( x \) is odd
- Let \( x = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
- Then \( y = x // 2 = k \).
- \( \gcd(2k + 1, k) = 1 \) (since \( 2k + 1 \) and \( k \) are coprime).
- So, \( \gcd(2k + 1, k) + k = 1 + k \).

In both cases, \( y = x // 2 \) does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Counterexample:
Consider \( x = 10 \):
- According to the program, \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \).
- \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
- However, if we choose \( y = 9 \):
  - \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \).
- But if we choose \( y = 6 \):
  - \( \gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \).
- If we choose \( y = 7 \):
  - \( \gcd(10, 7) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8 \).
- The program's choice of \( y = 5 \) is correct in this case, but it's not guaranteed to be the best choice for all \( x \).

Consider another example, \( x = 7 \):
- According to the program, \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \).
- \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
- However, if we choose \( y = 6 \):
  - \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
- The program's choice of \( y = 3 \) is not optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
