The code assigns the value of `x // 2` to `y`. The value of `x` is taken from the next input integer. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged, and the constraints on `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) still apply. The new value of `y` will be the integer division of `x` by 2, which means `y` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000; `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.**
