To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
2. `i` is incremented by 1. However, the value of `i` is also not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
3. `x` is an input integer.
4. `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means it will be the integer part of `x` divided by 2.
- The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`.

### Output:
The output will be the integer value of `x` divided by 2. Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2)**
