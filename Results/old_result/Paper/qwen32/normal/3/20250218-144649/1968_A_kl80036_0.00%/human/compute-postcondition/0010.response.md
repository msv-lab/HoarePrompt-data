The value of `y` is assigned the value of `x` integer divided by 2. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, while `x` retains its input value. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**.
