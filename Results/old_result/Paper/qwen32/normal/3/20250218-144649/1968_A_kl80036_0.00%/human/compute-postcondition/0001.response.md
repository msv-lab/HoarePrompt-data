Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000; `x` is assigned the value of the next input integer.**

In natural language: The value of `x` is updated to the integer value of the next input. The value of `t` and the condition for `x` (that it must be between 2 and 1000) remain unchanged.
