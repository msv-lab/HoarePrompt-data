Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop variable `i` is controlled by the range determined by the input value. The state at the end of the previous iteration tells us that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `x` and `y` are defined based on the input `x`.

However, the loop variable `i` is what primarily determines whether the loop will execute again. The input value `t` is used to determine the range of the loop, and `i` is incremented within the loop.

Given that `i` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer in the sequence. Since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, `i` must be less than `t` for the loop to continue.

The state of `x` and `y` does not affect the loop's continuation directly, as they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we only need to adjust `i` and ensure that `t` remains the same (since `t` is determined by the input and not modified within the loop).

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `t` should remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**

Given the above, the correct state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**

But to be more precise in terms of the next value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**

Since `i` has already been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration would start with the next value of `i`. If `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the final state should reflect that `i` has been incremented:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**

To be explicit about the next value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head and `i` is the only loop variable, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1**
