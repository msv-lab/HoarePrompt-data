Reasoning:
The program provided is not guaranteed to find the integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The program simply computes \( y = x // 2 \) for each test case and prints it. However, \( y = x // 2 \) does not necessarily maximize the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For \( x = 10 \), the program prints \( y = 5 \). Indeed, \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\) is the maximum possible value.
- For \( x = 7 \), the program prints \( y = 3 \). Here, \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\), but \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\) is actually the maximum possible value.

Thus, the program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
