Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
