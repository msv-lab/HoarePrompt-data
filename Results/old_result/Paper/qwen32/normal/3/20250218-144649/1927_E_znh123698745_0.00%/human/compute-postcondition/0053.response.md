Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Description
1. **answer**: This list is constructed by starting with 1 and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of an array until all elements are included.
2. **a**: This is a list defined based on the value of `n`:
   - If `n` is even, `a` is `[n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 1]`.
   - If `n` is odd, `a` is `[n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 2]`.

### Key Observations
- The problem statement does not specify the value of `n` or the array from which `answer` is constructed.
- Since `answer` is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements starting from 1, it implies that `answer` will be a list of integers arranged in a specific alternating pattern.
- However, without knowing the exact array or the value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact elements of `answer`.
- The variable `a` is explicitly defined based on `n`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Focused Task
Given the `print(*answer)` statement, we need to determine what `answer` will look like based on the provided construction method.

### Example Construction of `answer`
Let's consider a few examples to understand how `answer` is constructed:
- **Example 1: n = 4**
  - Array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Construction: Start with 1, then alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
  - `answer`: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`

- **Example 2: n = 5**
  - Array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Construction: Start with 1, then alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
  - `answer`: `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`

### General Pattern
From the examples, we can infer the general pattern:
- The list `answer` starts with 1.
- The next element is the largest remaining element.
- The following element is the smallest remaining element.
- This pattern continues until all elements are included.

### Final Answer
Since the exact array and the value of `n` are not provided, we can only describe the pattern of `answer`.

Output: **answer (where answer is a list starting with 1 and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of the array until all elements are included)**
