The provided code snippet assigns a new list containing only the integer `1` to the variable `answer`. Therefore, the value of `answer` is now `[1]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is [1], `a` is a list containing the integers [n, -n]**.
