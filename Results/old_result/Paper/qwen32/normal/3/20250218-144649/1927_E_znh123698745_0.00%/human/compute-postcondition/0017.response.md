The code snippet `a[0] += 1` increments the value at the 0th index of the list `a` by 1. Given that `a[0]` was initially used to index into the `array` list to retrieve an element and add it to the `answer` list, the only change here is to the value of `a[0]` itself. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` list has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`, `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
