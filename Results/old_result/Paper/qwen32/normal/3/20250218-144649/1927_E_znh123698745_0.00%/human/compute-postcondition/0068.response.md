The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index specified by the last element of the list `a` in the list `array` to the list `answer`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is `i + 1` (This seems to be a statement rather than an assignment, so `i` remains unchanged in terms of its value in this context)

The value of `answer` will be updated by adding the element from `array` at the index `a[-1]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`**.
