The code snippet provided is `answer.append(array[a[-1]])`. This line of code appends an element from `array` to the `answer` list. The element that is appended is the one at the index specified by the last element of the `a` list (`a[-1]`).

Given the initial state, `t`, `n`, and `k` are described, but `answer`, `array`, and `a` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. For the purpose of this task, we will assume that `answer` and `array` are lists, and `a` is a list containing at least one element.

The impact of the code on the program is that the `answer` list will have a new element added to it. The specific element added is determined by the value of `a[-1]`, which is the last element of the `a` list, and this value is used as an index to access an element in the `array` list.

Since the specific values of `answer`, `array`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value that is appended to `answer`. However, we can describe the state after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is 5, `answer` has a new element appended which is `array[a[-1]]`.**

In Natural language: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` remains greater than 5, `k` remains the second input integer, and `i` remains 5. The `answer` list now includes a new element, which is the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a`.
