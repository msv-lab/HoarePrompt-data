Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is 5. If `(-1) ** i == -1` (which is true since `i` is 5), `answer` has a new element appended which is `array[a[-1]]`, and `a[-1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `answer` has one more element appended from `array[a[0]]` before the increment, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
