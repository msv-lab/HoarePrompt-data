The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `array` (referred to as `a` in the code) by 1. The initial state specifies that `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `answer` contains the element at index `a[-1]` of `array`. Since `a[-1]` is the last element of `array`, it is initially `n`. After the operation `a[-1] -= 1`, the last element of `array` becomes `n-1`.

The value of `answer` was initially the value of `array[-1]`, which is `n`. After the code execution, `answer` still holds the value `n` because the operation modifies `array` directly and does not affect `answer` unless explicitly reassigned.

Given the initial state and the operation, the updated state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive with the last element decremented by 1, `i` is 4, `answer` is `n`.**
