To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop across multiple test cases. The loop handles each test case independently, and its behavior is consistent for each execution.

### Loop Behavior Analysis:
- **Initialization**: For each test case, `array` is initialized as a list of integers from 1 to `n`.
- **Construction of `answer`**: The `answer` list is constructed by starting with 1, then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array`:
  - On odd indices, the element from the end of `array` (decrementing index) is added.
  - On even indices, the element from the start of `array` (incrementing index) is added.
- **Loop Execution**: This process continues until all elements from `array` are included in `answer`.

### Output State for Each Test Case:
For each test case, the `answer` list will be constructed as follows:
- If `n` is **odd**, the `answer` list will be: `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1]`.
- If `n` is **even**, the `answer` list will be: `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2 + 1, n//2]`.

### General Output State:
Since the loop handles each test case independently and the construction of `answer` is consistent for each test case, the output state after all iterations will simply be the concatenation of the `answer` lists for each test case.

### Final Output State:
The final output state will be the sequence of `answer` lists for all test cases, printed one per line.

### Conclusion:
The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the sequence of `answer` lists for each test case, constructed as described above.

Output State: **The output state is a sequence of `answer` lists for each test case, where each `answer` list is constructed by starting with 1 and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array` until all elements are included. For each test case, if `n` is odd, the `answer` list is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1]`. If `n` is even, the `answer` list is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2 + 1, n//2]`. Each `answer` list is printed on a new line.**
