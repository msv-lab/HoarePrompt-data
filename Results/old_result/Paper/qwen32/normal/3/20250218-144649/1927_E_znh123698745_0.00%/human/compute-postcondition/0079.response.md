To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's carefully analyze the loop and the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n`: Input integer (length of the list `array`)
- `k`: Input integer (not used in the loop)
- `a`: List `[1, -1]`
- `array`: List of integers from 1 to `n`
- `answer`: List `[1]`

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration:
  - If `i` is odd, `answer` appends `array[a[-1]]` and `a[-1]` is decremented.
  - If `i` is even, `answer` appends `array[a[0]]` and `a[0]` is incremented.

### Iteration Details:
1. **Iteration 1 (i = 1, odd)**:
   - `answer` appends `array[a[-1]]` which is `array[-1]` (last element of `array`).
   - `a[-1]` is decremented: `a` becomes `[1, -2]`.
   - `answer`: `[1, n]`

2. **Iteration 2 (i = 2, even)**:
   - `answer` appends `array[a[0]]` which is `array[1]` (second element of `array`).
   - `a[0]` is incremented: `a` becomes `[2, -2]`.
   - `answer`: `[1, n, 2]`

3. **Iteration 3 (i = 3, odd)**:
   - `answer` appends `array[a[-1]]` which is `array[-2]` (second last element of `array`).
   - `a[-1]` is decremented: `a` becomes `[2, -3]`.
   - `answer`: `[1, n, 2, n-1]`

### General Pattern:
- For odd `i`, the last element of `array` is appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` is decremented.
- For even `i`, the first element of `array` (considering the current `a[0]` index) is appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` is incremented.

### Final State:
- The loop runs `n-1` times.
- `answer` will have `n` elements: `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ...]`.

### Output State:
The final `answer` list will be a sequence starting with `1`, alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array`.

Output State: **[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, (n//2 + 1) if n is odd]**

In natural language, the final state of `answer` is a list starting with `1` and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining integers from `1` to `n` until all integers are included.
