The code snippet provided appends an element from `array` to `answer`. Specifically, it appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` of `array` to `answer`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is `i + 1`. Since the operation does not modify `n` or `i`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `answer` now contains an additional element from `array`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`.**
