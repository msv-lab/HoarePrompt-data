In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_`, and it iterates over the range of an integer value obtained from `input()`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by the `input()`, which is expected to be the number of test cases, `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the value obtained from `input()`. This value should match `t` to ensure the loop executes the correct number of times.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, its initial value does not matter for the loop to execute. Therefore, we only need to ensure that the input value matches `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input value must be equal to `t`**.
