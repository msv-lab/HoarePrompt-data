The code appends the element at index `a[0]` of `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `a[0]` is 1. Therefore, the element at index 1 of `array` is appended to `answer`. Since `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the element at index 1 of `array` is 2. Thus, `answer` now contains the integers 1 and 2.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**
