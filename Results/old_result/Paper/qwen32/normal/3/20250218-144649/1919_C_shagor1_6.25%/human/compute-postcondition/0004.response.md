The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `inp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is `0`.**
