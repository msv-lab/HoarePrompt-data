The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by 1. Therefore, the value of `ans` will be increased by 1 from its initial state.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` and `ans` is 3 if `a` is greater than `n + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**
