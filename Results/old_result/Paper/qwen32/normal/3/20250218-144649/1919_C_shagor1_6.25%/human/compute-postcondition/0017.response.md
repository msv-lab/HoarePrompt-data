The only variable in the loop head is `a`, which is the loop variable iterating over `inp`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element. The variable `a` has just taken the value of the last element in `inp` during the previous iteration.

To proceed to the next iteration, `a` must take the value of the next element in `inp`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `inp` sequentially, the next value of `a` should be the element immediately following the current `a` in the list. If `a` was the last element in the previous iteration, the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration.

Assume that `a` was the `k`-th element in `inp` during the previous iteration. Then, for the next iteration, `a` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in `inp`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `a` is the next element in `inp` after the previous value of `a`.**
