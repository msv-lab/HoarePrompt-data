The value of `y` is updated to the value of `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is `0`; and `a` is greater than `x`. The current value of `a` is less than or equal to `y`.
