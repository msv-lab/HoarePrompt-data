Postcondition: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the next integer in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and if `a` is greater than the original value of `y`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
