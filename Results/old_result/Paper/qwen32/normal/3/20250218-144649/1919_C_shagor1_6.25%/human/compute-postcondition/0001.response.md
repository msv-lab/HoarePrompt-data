The code snippet provided assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and it is used as the number of iterations for a loop, but this `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided. The variable `n` is newly introduced and takes the integer value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer.**
