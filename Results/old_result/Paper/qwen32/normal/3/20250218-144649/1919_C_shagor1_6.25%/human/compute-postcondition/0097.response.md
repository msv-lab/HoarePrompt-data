The code `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to the variable `y`. The values of `inp`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `a_next` (the integer following the current `a` in `inp`), `y` is `a`**.
