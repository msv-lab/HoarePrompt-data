Postcondition: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `a_next` (the integer following the current `a` in `inp`). If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, no change is made to `ans`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
