The code snippet `x = a` sets the value of `x` to the value of `a`. Given that `a` is less than or equal to `x` and initially `x` is `n + 1`, after this assignment, `x` will take the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is `a`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.**
