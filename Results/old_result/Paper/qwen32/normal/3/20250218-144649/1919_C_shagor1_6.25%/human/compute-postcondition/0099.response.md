The value of `y` is assigned the value of `a`. The other variables (`inp`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `a_next` (the integer following the current `a` in `inp`), and `y` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `a_next` (the integer following the current `a` in `inp`), `y` is equal to `a`.**
