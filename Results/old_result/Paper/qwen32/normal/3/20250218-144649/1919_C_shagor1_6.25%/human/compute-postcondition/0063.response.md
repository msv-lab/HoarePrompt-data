The provided code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation that checks if `x` is equal to `y`. However, it does not assign the result of this comparison to any variable, nor does it alter the values of `x` or `y` in any way. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, and `inp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` and `ans` is 2 if `a` is greater than `n + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**
