The `print('NO')` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`) mentioned in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is directly printed as it is.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which means it will output the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
Output: **NO**
