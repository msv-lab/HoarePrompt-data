Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', the current value of `s` remains '00'. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the conditions specific to the if part are met. If `count_1` is even, either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2, unless `s.count('11')` is exactly 1 and `count_1` is 2, in which case the conditions specific to the if part are met.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial conditions.
