The `print('YES')` statement in the provided code snippet directly prints the string 'YES'. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of the `print('YES')` statement because it is printing a static string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The print statement is `print('YES')`.
2. **Analyze the String**: The string 'YES' is explicitly provided in the print statement.
3. **Variable Influence**: The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` are not used within the print statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
