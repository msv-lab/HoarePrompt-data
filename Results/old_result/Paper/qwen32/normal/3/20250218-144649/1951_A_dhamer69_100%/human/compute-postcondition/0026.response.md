The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`), but none of these variables are used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output will not depend on the values of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is executed.
2. This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` to the output.
3. No other variables or conditions affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
