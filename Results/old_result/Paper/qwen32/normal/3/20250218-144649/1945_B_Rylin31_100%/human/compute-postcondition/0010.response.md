Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. For each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input, and the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is computed and printed. The variable `i` has been incremented from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution.**

In simpler terms: The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, computes the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`, and prints it. The loop counter `i` has gone through all values from 0 to `t-1`.
