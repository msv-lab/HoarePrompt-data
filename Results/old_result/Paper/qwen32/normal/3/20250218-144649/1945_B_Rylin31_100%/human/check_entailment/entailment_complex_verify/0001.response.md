### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Launch Times**: 
  - First installation: `a, 2a, 3a, ...`
  - Second installation: `b, 2b, 3b, ...`
- **Visibility Duration**:
  - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch, i.e., from launch time `x` to `x + m`.
- **Objective**:
  - Determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

#### Provided Program Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- It computes and prints the value `m // a + m // b + 2`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect.
- The `+ 2` term is considered arbitrary and not aligned with the problem requirements.
- The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determining the maximum overlap within one period.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
- **`m // a`**: Counts the number of fireworks from the first installation visible within the first `m` minutes.
- **`m // b`**: Counts the number of fireworks from the second installation visible within the first `m` minutes.
- **`+ 2`**: This term is not justified by the problem description. It appears to be an incorrect assumption that does not account for the actual overlap of fireworks.

#### Correct Approach:
- To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the periodicity of the fireworks launches and their visibility intervals.
- The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` gives the periodicity of the combined launch sequence.
- Within one period, we need to count the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at the same time.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect, and the `+ 2` term is not justified by the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect based on the problem description and the analysis provided.
