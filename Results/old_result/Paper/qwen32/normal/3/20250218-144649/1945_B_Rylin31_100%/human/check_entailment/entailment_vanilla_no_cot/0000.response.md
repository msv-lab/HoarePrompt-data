Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program does not account for the overlap of fireworks launched by the two installations and their visibility periods.

To solve the problem correctly, one must consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the launch intervals \(a\) and \(b\). The LCM will give us the period after which the launch patterns repeat. Within this period, we need to determine how many fireworks from each installation are visible at the same time and find the maximum overlap.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    def max_fireworks(a, b, m):
        lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        count = 0
        for t in range(lcm):
            fireworks_a = (t + m) // a - t // a
            fireworks_b = (t + m) // b - t // b
            count = max(count, fireworks_a + fireworks_b)
        return count

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_fireworks(a, b, m))

# Example usage
# func()
```

This program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by iterating through one period of the LCM and counting the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible during each minute within that period. The maximum count is then returned.
