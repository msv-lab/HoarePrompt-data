Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr`. The first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
        not_c = False
        break
    A = not A


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is True; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with at least two elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, and the second element is any integer greater than 1; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `not_c` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with at least two elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, and the second element is any integer greater than 1; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `not_c` remains True; `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is True; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with at least two elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, and the second element is any integer greater than 1; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `not_c` remains True; `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
