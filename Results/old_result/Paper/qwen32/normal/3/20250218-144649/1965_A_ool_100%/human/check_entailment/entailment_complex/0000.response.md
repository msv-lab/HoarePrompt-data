### Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules. However, there are several issues with the logic in the `func_1` function that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The input parsing in the main loop is incorrect. The first line within each test case (which contains `n`) should be read separately from the second line (which contains the array of stone counts). The current implementation incorrectly reads both `n` and the array into the same variable `n`, and then reads the next line into `arr`. This will cause issues because `n` will not be an integer but a list.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The function `func_1` attempts to determine the winner based on the sorted unique values of the stone counts. However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The game is essentially a variation of the Nim game where the winning strategy depends on the binary XOR of the pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is 0, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not correctly handle cases where the smallest pile size is 1 or where there are gaps in the sorted unique values of the pile sizes.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly determine the winner, we should compute the XOR of all pile sizes for each test case. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    xor_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor_sum ^= num
    print('Alice' if xor_sum != 0 else 'Bob')
```

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified above, the original program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
