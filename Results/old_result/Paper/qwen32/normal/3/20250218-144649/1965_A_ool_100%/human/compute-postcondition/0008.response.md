Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr` with at least two elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, and the second element is any integer greater than 1; `not_c` is True; the current value of `i` is such that `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`.**
