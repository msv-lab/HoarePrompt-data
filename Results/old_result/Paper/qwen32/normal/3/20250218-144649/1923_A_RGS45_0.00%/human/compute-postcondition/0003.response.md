The code snippet assigns the result of `str(input(''))` to the variable `arr`. This means `arr` will hold the string input provided by the user. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user.**
