After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0, as the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` reaches 0. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, but they will not be meaningful after the loop ends because the loop does not retain these values between iterations. The only variable that retains a meaningful value after all iterations is `t`.

Output State: **t is 0.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that no more iterations are left to perform. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) will have the values they held during the last iteration of the loop, but they are not relevant after the loop ends.
