Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in the list for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = str(input(''))
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring `arr[x:n - y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999; `n` is the integer input provided by the user; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is the new integer input provided by the user, `arr` is the new string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed new `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
