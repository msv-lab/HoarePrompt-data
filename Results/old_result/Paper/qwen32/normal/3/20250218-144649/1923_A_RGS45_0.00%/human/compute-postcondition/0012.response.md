The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string. This index corresponds to the position of '1' from the end of the original string `arr`. If '1' is not found, `y` will be -1.

Given the initial state, the value of `y` will be updated based on the reversed string. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999; `n` is the integer input provided by the user; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found; `z` is the substring of the previous `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.**
