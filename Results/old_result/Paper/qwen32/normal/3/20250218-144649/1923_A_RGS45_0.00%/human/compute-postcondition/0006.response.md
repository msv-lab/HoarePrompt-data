To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. Given the initial state, `z` is assigned the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to `n - y`. 

Let's break it down:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `y` remains unchanged.
- `z` is assigned the substring `arr[x:n - y]`.

The value of `z` will depend on the values of `x`, `n`, and `y`:
- If `x` is -1 (meaning '1' is not found in `arr`), then trying to access `arr[x:n - y]` will raise an error because `x` is out of bounds. However, since the problem statement doesn't specify handling this case, we will assume `x` is not -1.
- If `y` is -1 (meaning '1' is not found in `arr`), then `n - y` will be `n + 1`, which is out of bounds. Again, we assume `y` is not -1.
- If `x` is not -1 and `y` is not -1, `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n - y`.

Given these conditions, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring `arr[x:n - y]`.**
