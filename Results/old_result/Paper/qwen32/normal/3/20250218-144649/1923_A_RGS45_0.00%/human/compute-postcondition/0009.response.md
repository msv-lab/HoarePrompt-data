The code snippet `n = int(input(''))` changes the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999; `n` is the integer input provided by the user; `arr` is the string input provided by the user; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring `arr[x:n - y]`.**
