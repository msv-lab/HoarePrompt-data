Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999 (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it can be ignored for this task).
2. `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
3. `arr` is the string input provided by the user.
4. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found.
5. `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' was not found.
6. `z` is the substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` is -1.

2. **Determine `y`**:
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`.
   - If '1' is not found in the reversed `arr`, `y` is -1.
   - Note: The index `y` in the reversed `arr` corresponds to the index `len(arr) - 1 - y` in the original `arr`.

3. **Determine `z`**:
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y`.
   - If `x` is -1 or `n - y` is out of bounds, the substring `z` will be empty or may raise an error, but based on typical behavior, we assume `z` is derived within the bounds of `arr`.

4. **Determine `z.count('0')`**:
   - This counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

### Final Output:
The code prints the count of '0's in the substring `z` of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

### Explanation:
- If `x` is -1 (no '1' in `arr`), `z` would be an empty string, and `z.count('0')` would be 0.
- If `y` is -1 (no '1' in the reversed `arr`), `n - y` would be `n + 1`, which is out of bounds, and `z` would be an empty string, and `z.count('0')` would be 0.
- If both `x` and `y` are valid indices, `z` is a substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y`, and `z.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in this substring.

### Final Output Format:
Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr from x to n - y)**
