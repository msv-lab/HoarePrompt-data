The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute `t` times, and the value of `t` is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

Since the loop variable `_` does not influence whether the loop executes, we only need to ensure that `t` is set correctly for the loop to execute the intended number of times. The other variables `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
