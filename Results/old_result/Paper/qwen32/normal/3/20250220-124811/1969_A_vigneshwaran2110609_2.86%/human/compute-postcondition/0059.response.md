Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `p`, `x` remain unchanged from their initial state; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `x` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**
