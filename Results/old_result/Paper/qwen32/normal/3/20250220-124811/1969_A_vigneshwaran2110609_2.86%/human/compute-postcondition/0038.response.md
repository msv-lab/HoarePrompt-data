Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, and `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `x` is the new input integer such that x >= 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
