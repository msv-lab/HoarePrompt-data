The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will be updated to the integer provided by the user input. The precondition for `n` before this line is that it is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. After the execution of this line, the value of `n` will be the input integer, but it still must satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 50 as per the problem statement. The variable `t` and the list `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].**
