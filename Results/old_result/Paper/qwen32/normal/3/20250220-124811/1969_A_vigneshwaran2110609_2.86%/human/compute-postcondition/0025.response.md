Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is the new input integer such that x >= 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` for some `i` in the context of the if statement.**
