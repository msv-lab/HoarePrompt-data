The provided Python code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. The values of `x` and `n` are updated to the values read from the input, but this operation is not shown in the snippet provided. Therefore, we assume `x` and `n` have been updated to the new values read from the input and are within their specified ranges (1 <= n <= x).

Since `ans` is the only variable explicitly modified in the given code snippet, its value is set to 0. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the update to `x` and `n` from the input, which is already factored into the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers updated to the values read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x, and `ans` is 0.**
