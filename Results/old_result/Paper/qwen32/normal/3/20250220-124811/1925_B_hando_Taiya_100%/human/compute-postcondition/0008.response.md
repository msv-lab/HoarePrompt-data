Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). Additionally, `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. The current value of `ans` is `max(ans, x // i)`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
