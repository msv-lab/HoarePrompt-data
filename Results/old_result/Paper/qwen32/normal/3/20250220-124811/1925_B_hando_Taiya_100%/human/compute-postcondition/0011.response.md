The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `isqrt(x) + 1`. Since we are only concerned with adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we need to focus on the variable `i` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x
- `ans` is updated based on the condition that if `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
- The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

After the previous iteration, `i` has taken on some value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is updated based on the condition that if `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
