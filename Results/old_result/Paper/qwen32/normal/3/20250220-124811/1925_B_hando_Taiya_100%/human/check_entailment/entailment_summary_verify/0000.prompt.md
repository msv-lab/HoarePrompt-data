You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` for each of `t` test cases, where `1 <= n <= x`. It calculates and prints the maximum value `i` within the range from 1 to the integer square root of `x` such that either `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Task**: Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems is `x` and the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.
- **Input**: 
  - `t`: number of test cases.
  - For each test case, two integers `x` (total difficulty) and `n` (number of sub-problems).
- **Output**: Print the maximum balance (GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems) for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`. It then calculates the maximum possible GCD of `n` sub-problems that sum up to `x` by iterating through all possible divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`.

#### Key Points:
- The program checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` and if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`.
- It updates the maximum GCD (`ans`) accordingly.

#### Potential Issues:
- The logic seems correct in terms of finding the maximum divisor that can be the GCD of `n` sub-problems.
- However, we need to verify if the logic covers all edge cases correctly.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
3
10 3
5 5
420 69
```
Output:
```
2
1
6
```
The program correctly provides the expected output for these examples.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Case 1**: `x = 1`, `n = 1`
   - The only possible sub-problem difficulty is 1, and the GCD is 1.
   - Expected output: `1`

2. **Case 2**: `x = 100`, `n = 1`
   - The only possible sub-problem difficulty is 100, and the GCD is 100.
   - Expected output: `100`

3. **Case 3**: `x = 100`, `n = 100`
   - Each sub-problem difficulty is 1, and the GCD is 1.
   - Expected output: `1`

4. **Case 4**: `x = 100`, `n = 2`
   - Possible sub-problem difficulties are 50 and 50, and the GCD is 50.
   - Expected output: `50`

5. **Case 5**: `x = 100`, `n = 50`
   - Possible sub-problem difficulties are 2 and 98, 4 and 96, etc.
   - The maximum possible GCD is 2.
   - Expected output: `2`

Let's test the program with these edge cases:

#### Edge Case Testing:
Input:
```
5
1 1
100 1
100 100
100 2
100 50
```
Expected Output:
```
1
100
1
50
2
```

Let's run the program with these inputs and verify the output.

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with the provided examples and additional edge cases, the program seems to produce the correct output for all cases. The logic correctly finds the maximum possible GCD of `n` sub-problems that sum up to `x`.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly identifies the maximum possible GCD by iterating through all divisors of `x` and checking if they can be the GCD of `n` sub-problems. The logic handles various cases, including edge cases, correctly.
