Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

To summarize: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` and `n` remain integers with `n` between 1 and `x`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. If `n` is greater than `i`, `ans` remains unchanged.
