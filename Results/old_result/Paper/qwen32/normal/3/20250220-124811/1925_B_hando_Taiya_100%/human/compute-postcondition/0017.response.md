The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is defined by `isqrt(x) + 1`. According to the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `ans` is updated based on the conditions provided

Since only `i` can be adjusted at the start of the next iteration, we increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`), `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the conditions are met**.

To be more precise in the state representation, we can say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions provided**.
