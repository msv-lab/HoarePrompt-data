Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of the integer division `x // i`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and the incremented `i` remain unchanged.
