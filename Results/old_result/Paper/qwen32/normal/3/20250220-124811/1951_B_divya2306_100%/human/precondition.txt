t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. The list a contains n integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and all elements in a are distinct. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
