The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `win_with_swap`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is the index where `a[i] > a[k-1]` if such an element exists, otherwise `i` remains `n-1`.
- `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2` if `a[i] > a[k-1]`, otherwise `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and is less than `k - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` is the loop variable in the `range` function), and `win_with_swap` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop head.

Given that `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1` and `i` is currently at a value such that the loop is still running, incrementing `i` by 1 will still satisfy the condition `i < k - 1` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]` and `wins` is less than k - 1; `i` is the index where `a[i] > a[k-1]` if such an element exists, otherwise `i` remains n-1, incremented by 1; `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2` if `a[i] > a[k-1]`, otherwise `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and is less than k - 1.**
