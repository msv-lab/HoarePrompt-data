Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]` and `wins` is less than k - 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k-1]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. `i` is `i + 1`. `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 1` and is less than k - 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```
win_with_swap += 1
```

Impact: The value of `win_with_swap` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]` and `wins` is less than k - 1; `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 1` and is less than k - 1.**
