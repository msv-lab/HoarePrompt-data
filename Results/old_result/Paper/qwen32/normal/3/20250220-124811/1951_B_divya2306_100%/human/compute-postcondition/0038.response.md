Functionality: **The function reads integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the number of elements in `a` that are strictly less than `a[k-1]`, considering possible swaps to maximize this count without exceeding `k` elements. The function does not return any value.**
