Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations and the duration for which each firework is visible.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any point in time. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations coincide and then calculating the number of fireworks visible within the visibility window.

Here's a correct approach:

1. Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the interval `[0, m]`.
3. Account for the overlap of fireworks launched by both installations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        count_a = m // a + 1
        count_b = m // b + 1
        count_ab = m // lcm_ab + 1
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - count_ab
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at any point in time by considering the overlap of fireworks from both installations.
