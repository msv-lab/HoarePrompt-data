Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it is correct according to the problem description.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Data Structure:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It iterates over the string `s` and updates the count for each difficulty level in the `defaultdict`.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Additional Problems:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - For each unique difficulty level in the dictionary, if the count of that difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - count` to `ans`.
   - This is intended to ensure that for each difficulty level, there are at least `m` problems.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues:

1. **Default Value Function:**
   - The program uses `defaultdict(default_value)`, but `default_value` is not defined anywhere in the given code. This will result in a `NameError`.
   - To fix this, it should use `defaultdict(int)` to initialize counts to zero.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - The logic for calculating `ans` is incorrect. The program should ensure that for each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G'), there are at least `m` problems. The current logic only checks for the difficulty levels that are present in the input string, which is insufficient.
   - It should check all 7 difficulty levels and compute the difference if the count is less than `m`.

3. **Unused Function:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never used. This can be removed.

### Corrected Logic:

For each test case:
- Initialize a dictionary to keep count of each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G').
- Read the input string and update the counts.
- For each of the 7 difficulty levels, if the count is less than `m`, add the difference to the answer.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned, the program is **incorrect** as it stands. It needs to be corrected to properly account for all 7 difficulty levels and handle the default value for the dictionary correctly.

Correctness: **False**
