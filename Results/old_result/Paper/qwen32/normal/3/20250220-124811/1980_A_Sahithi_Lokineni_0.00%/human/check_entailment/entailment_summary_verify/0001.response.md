### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Vlad already has `n` problems with given difficulty levels. He needs to determine the minimum number of additional problems he needs to create to ensure that each of the 7 difficulty levels is represented in each of the `m` rounds.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Data Structure:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
   - However, there is an issue with the `default_value` function which is undefined. The correct usage should be `defaultdict(int)`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and updates the count for each difficulty level in the `defaultdict`.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Additional Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the keys in the dictionary and checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If so, it adds `m - count` to `ans`.
   - This logic is flawed because it only considers the difficulty levels present in the input string. It should consider all 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and ensure each has at least `m` problems.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Undefined `default_value` Function:**
   - The code uses `defaultdict(default_value)`, but `default_value` is not defined. It should be `defaultdict(int)` to initialize counts to zero.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - The current logic only checks the difficulty levels present in the input string. It should check all 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and compute the difference if the count is less than `m`.

3. **Unused Function:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never used and can be removed.

### Corrected Logic:

For each test case:
- Initialize a dictionary to keep count of each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A' to 'G').
- Read the input string and update the counts.
- For each of the 7 difficulty levels, if the count is less than `m`, add the difference to the answer.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned, the program is **incorrect** as it stands. It needs to be corrected to properly account for all 7 difficulty levels and handle the default value for the dictionary correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
