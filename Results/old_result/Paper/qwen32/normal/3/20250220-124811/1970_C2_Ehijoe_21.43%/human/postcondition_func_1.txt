The function reads input to construct a tree represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors. It identifies the leaf nodes and then determines the winner of a game based on the starting node and the moves calculated by another function `func_1`. The game's outcome is printed as either "Ron" or "Hermione" depending on whether any of the moves are odd.
