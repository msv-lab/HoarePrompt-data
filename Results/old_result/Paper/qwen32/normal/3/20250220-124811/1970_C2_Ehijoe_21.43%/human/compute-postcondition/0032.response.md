Postcondition: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is the integer value from the input, `n` is the number of nodes, `t` is the second integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n - 1, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that are leaves, `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`. At least one element in `moves` is odd.**
