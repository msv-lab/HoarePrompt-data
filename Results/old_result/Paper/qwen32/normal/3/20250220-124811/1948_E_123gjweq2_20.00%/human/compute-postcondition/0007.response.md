The code provided attempts to assign the value of `clique` to an element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state. This means that the code as written cannot be executed without knowing the value of `i`.

Since the task requires us to simulate the execution based on the given initial state and the code snippet, and `i` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact index in `cliquess` that will be updated. Therefore, we will assume that `i` is a valid index within the range defined by the initial conditions and provide a general output state.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that will be changed is the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`. The value at this index will be set to `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**

In natural language: The element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i` is now set to the value of `clique`. All other variables retain their initial values.
