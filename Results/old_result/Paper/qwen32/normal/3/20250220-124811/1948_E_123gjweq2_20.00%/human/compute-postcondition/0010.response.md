The provided code snippet is `cliquess[left + i] = clique`. This line assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`
- `clique` is an integer
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`
- `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`
- `i` is incremented by 1

The line `cliquess[left + i] = clique` does not change any of the variables' values except for the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`, which is already `clique` according to the initial state. Therefore, the state of the `cliquess` list at index `left + i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

In natural language: The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `arr[left + i]`, and `cliquess[left + i]` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
