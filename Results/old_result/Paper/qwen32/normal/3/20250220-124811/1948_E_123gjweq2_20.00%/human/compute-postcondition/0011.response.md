The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` has increased by 1 from the previous state. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`.

Given:
- `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `mid` remains the same.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1** (from the previous state, so `i` should be the previous `i` + 1)

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value it should take in the loop.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1** (adjusting `i` to the next value)

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is the previous `i` + 1**

To simplify, if the previous `i` was `x`, the new `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new state should reflect that `i` has increased by 1.
