You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
    - This function is intended to assign integers to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.
    - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which seems like a reasonable initial guess for the minimum number of cliques, but it does not guarantee the optimal solution.
    - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, which are supposed to store the integer assignments and clique assignments for each vertex, respectively.
    - It then calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the start and end indices of the vertices in the current clique and the clique number.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
    - This function assigns integers to the vertices in the range `[left, right]` and assigns them to the specified `clique`.
    - It calculates `small_element`, `big_element`, and the midpoint `mid` of the range.
    - It assigns the first `mid` elements in ascending order starting from `small_element` and the remaining elements in descending order starting from `big_element`.
    - It assigns the clique number to each vertex in the range.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variables**:
    - The `arr` and `cliquess` variables used in `make_array` are not defined within its scope. They are expected to be global variables, but they are not declared as such. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Assigning Integers and Cliques**:
    - The logic for assigning integers and cliques does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
    - The program assigns integers in a specific pattern (ascending and then descending) but does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs of vertices in each clique.

3. **Output**:
    - The program does not ensure that the output format is correct or that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct solution for all test cases. The logic for assigning integers and cliques is flawed, and the program does not handle the constraints properly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
