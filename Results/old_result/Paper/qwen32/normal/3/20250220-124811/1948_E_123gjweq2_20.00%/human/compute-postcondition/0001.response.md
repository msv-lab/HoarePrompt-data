The code snippet assigns the value of `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned, `small_element` is `left + 1`, and `big_element` is `right + 1`.**
