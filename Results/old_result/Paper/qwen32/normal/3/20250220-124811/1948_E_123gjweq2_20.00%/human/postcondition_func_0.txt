The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and `2n` inclusive. It calculates the ceiling of `n / k` to determine the number of cliques. The function then creates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each of length `n`, and fills them with numbers representing the clique to which each index belongs, with each clique number repeated up to `k` times. Finally, it prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and the list `cliquess`.
