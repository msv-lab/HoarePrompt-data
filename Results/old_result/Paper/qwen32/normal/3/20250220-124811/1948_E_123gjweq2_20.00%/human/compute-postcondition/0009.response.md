The code snippet `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` updates the value of `arr` at the index `left + i`. Given the initial state, `small_element` is `left + 1`, so `small_element + i` becomes `(left + 1) + i`.

The value of `arr[left + i]` was previously `(left + 1) + i`, and after the execution of the code, it remains `(left + 1) + i`. Therefore, the value of `arr[left + i]` does not change in this specific context, but the code is structured to set it to this value explicitly.

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `cliquess[left + i]`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
