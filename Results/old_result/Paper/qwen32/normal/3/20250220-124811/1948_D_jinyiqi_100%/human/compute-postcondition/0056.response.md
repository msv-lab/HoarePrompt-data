The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n // 2` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. This means that `j` is decreased by `1` in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`, and `count` is less than `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decreased by `1`. 

So, `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 1)`, and `count` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**
