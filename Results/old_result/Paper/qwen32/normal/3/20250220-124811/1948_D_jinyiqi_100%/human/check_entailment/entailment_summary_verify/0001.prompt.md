You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a string of characters from the input, checks for the longest palindromic subsequence that can be formed by considering '?' as a wildcard, and prints the length of this subsequence if found. If no such subsequence is found, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum length of a substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing all question marks with lowercase Latin letters. A tandem repeat is a string of even length where the first half is equal to the second half.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling the function `func_1()`.

2. **String Processing**:
    - `s` is converted to a list of characters.
    - The program iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat, starting from the maximum possible length (half of the string length) down to 1.
    - For each possible length `j`, it checks all possible substrings of length `2*j` to see if they can form a tandem repeat.
    - The condition `if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is used to determine if the characters at positions `k` and `k+j` can be part of a tandem repeat. This condition allows for question marks to be considered as matching any character.

3. **Counting Matches**:
    - A counter `count` is used to keep track of the number of consecutive matching characters in the first and second halves of the substring.
    - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and the program prints `2*j` and exits the function.

4. **Output**:
    - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints `0`.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program's logic seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be considered:

1. **Handling Question Marks**: The condition `if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is not sufficient to determine if a tandem repeat can be formed. It allows question marks to match any character, which is correct, but it does not ensure that the characters that are not question marks match correctly.

2. **Example Verification**:
    - For the input `zaabaabz`, the program should output `6` because `aabaab` is a tandem repeat.
    - For the input `?????`, the program should output `4` because we can replace the question marks to form a tandem repeat like `aabb`.
    - For the input `code?????s`, the program should output `10` by replacing the question marks to form a tandem repeat like `codecode`.
    - For the input `codeforces`, the program should output `0` because no tandem repeat can be formed.

The provided program does not handle the matching of non-question mark characters correctly, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
