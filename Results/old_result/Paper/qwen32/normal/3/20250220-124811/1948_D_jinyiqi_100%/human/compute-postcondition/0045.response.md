To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the logic used to compute the `count` variable.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2.
- `j` is `n // 2`.
- `k` is 1.
- `count` is incremented by 1 if any of the following conditions are true:
  - `s[k]` is a question mark.
  - `s[k + j]` is a question mark.
  - `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`.
- Otherwise, `count` is 0.

### Analysis:
- `k` is set to 1.
- `j` is set to `n // 2`, which means `j` is the middle index of the list `s` if `n` is even, or the starting index of the second half if `n` is odd.
- The condition to increment `count` checks:
  - If the character at index `k` (which is 1) is a question mark.
  - If the character at index `k + j` is a question mark.
  - If the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` are the same.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print` statement outputs `count * 2`.
- Since `count` can only be 0 or 1 based on the given conditions, `count * 2` will be either 0 or 2.

### Conclusion:
- If the conditions for incrementing `count` are met, `count` will be 1, and `count * 2` will be 2.
- If the conditions for incrementing `count` are not met, `count` will be 0, and `count * 2` will be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **count * 2 (where count is 1 if s[1] is '?' or s[1 + n//2] is '?' or s[1] == s[1 + n//2], otherwise count is 0)**
