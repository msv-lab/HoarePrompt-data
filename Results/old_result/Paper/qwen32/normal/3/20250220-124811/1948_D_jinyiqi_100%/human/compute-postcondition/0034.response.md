Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0. Additionally, `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**
