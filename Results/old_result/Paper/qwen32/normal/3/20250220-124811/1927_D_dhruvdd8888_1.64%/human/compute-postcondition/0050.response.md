To determine the output of the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `num` is the element at index `N` in the list `nums`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a contiguous segment of equal elements in `nums`.
   - `LA` is the last valid index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided as input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted into `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is less than `r`.
   - The current value of `e` is less than `N`.
   - The conditions `tc > 5` and `ppp = 23` do not affect the state of the variables.

2. **Key points to consider:**
   - The value of `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - The value of `e` is the second element of the same tuple.
   - The print statement outputs `s` and `e + 1`.

3. **Constructing the output:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at `min(eli, LA)`.
   - The output is the value of `s` followed by `e + 1`.

Given the initial state, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e is the second element of the same tuple)**
