The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, regardless of the values of any other variables in the program. The precondition describes the state of various variables and conditions, but none of these affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it explicitly prints `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
