The code snippet `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `num` will be assigned the value of `nums[0]`. The other variables (`N`, `s`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`, and if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 0, num)` appended to it.**

In simpler terms, `num` now holds the value of the first element in the `nums` list, and all other conditions and values remain as specified in the initial state.
