Postcondition: **`i` is `N`, `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the new integers from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `tc` is greater than 5, or `tc` is less than or equal to 5 and `ppp` is unspecified. The condition `e < N` does not affect the values of the variables as the postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts.**
