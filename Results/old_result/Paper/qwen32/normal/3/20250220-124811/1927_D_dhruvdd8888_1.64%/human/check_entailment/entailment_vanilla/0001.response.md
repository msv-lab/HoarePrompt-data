Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find two different indices within a given range `[l, r]` such that the elements at these indices are not equal. If no such pair exists, we should return `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case separately. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array itself, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries themselves.

2. **Preprocessing**: The program processes the array to create a list of segments where each segment contains a contiguous block of the same number. This is done using a loop that iterates through the array and records the start and end indices of each segment along with the value of the segment.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or just after the left boundary `l` of the query. It then checks the segment to see if it can find a valid pair of indices within the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the indices of the valid pair or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment starting at or just after `l`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the segment found does not cover the entire range `[l, r]`. Specifically, it does not check if the segment found contains more than one distinct element or if the segment ends before `r`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Indices**: The logic for finding indices within the segment is flawed. For example, it checks if the start of the segment is greater than `l` and then assumes that `s-1` and `s` are valid indices. However, this does not guarantee that `a[s-1] != a[s]` or that both indices are within the range `[l, r]`.

3. **Inconsistent Logic for Different Test Cases**: The program includes conditional logic that seems to be for debugging or testing purposes (e.g., `if ppp == 23:`), which does not affect the correctness of the solution but suggests that the program may not be fully tested or optimized.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all cases and may produce incorrect results for some queries.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
