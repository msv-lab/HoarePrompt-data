### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its expected behavior based on the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` such that `a_i â‰  a_j`. The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a set of queries.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads the range `[l, r]`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program creates a list `arr` that groups consecutive equal elements in the array `nums`. Each element in `arr` is a tuple `(start, end, value)` representing the start and end indices of a segment of equal elements and the value of those elements.
   - The program appends `-1` to `nums` to simplify the loop logic.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first segment in `arr` that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the range `[l, r]`:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if the previous segment ends before `l`. If so, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because all elements in the segment are the same.
     - Otherwise, it prints the start index of the current segment and the next index after the end of the current segment.

### Issues and Errors:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments:**
   - The program does not correctly handle all cases where a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the range `[l, r]`. Specifically, it does not check for segments that start before `l` but end within `[l, r]` or segments that start within `[l, r]` but end after `r`.
   - The logic for determining the pair `(i, j)` is flawed. For example, if the segment starts before `l` and ends within `[l, r]`, the program should consider the end of this segment and the start of the next segment if it exists.

2. **Skipping Queries for Large Test Cases:**
   - The program includes a conditional statement that skips processing queries for certain test cases (`if tc > 5: if ppp == 23: continue`). This is likely a debugging statement and should be removed for the program to function correctly.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the results directly, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, the logic for determining the correct indices needs to be fixed.

### Correctness:

Given the issues and errors identified, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases correctly and includes debugging statements that skip processing queries for certain test cases.

**Correctness: False**
