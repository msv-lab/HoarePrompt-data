The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The variables `N`, `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `nums` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for a test case; `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
