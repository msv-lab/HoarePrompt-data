The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the values `-1, -1`. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Therefore, the output is simply the values specified in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. This statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.
3. None of the variables in the initial state (`i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `tc`, `ppp`) are used in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **-1, -1**
