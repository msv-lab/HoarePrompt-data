Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program does not correctly process each query. It uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in `arr` that contains the start of the query, but it does not correctly handle the end of the query or find a pair of different elements within the query range.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic for finding a pair of different elements within the query range is flawed. Specifically, the conditions to determine if a valid pair exists and which pair to output are incorrect.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all elements in the query range are the same.

4. **Debugging Code**: There are debugging print statements that should be removed or commented out in the final version of the program.

Here is a revised version of the program that correctly handles the problem:

```python
from sys import stdin

def main():
    input = stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    tc = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, input[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        q = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input[index:index + 2])
            queries.append((l - 1, r - 1))
            index += 2
        
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r):
                if nums[i] != nums[i + 1]:
                    results.append(f"{i + 1} {i + 2}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
        results.append("")  # Add a newline between test cases
    
    print("\n".join(results).strip())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised program reads the input correctly, processes each query, and finds a pair of different elements within the query range or reports that no such pair exists. It also handles the output format correctly.
