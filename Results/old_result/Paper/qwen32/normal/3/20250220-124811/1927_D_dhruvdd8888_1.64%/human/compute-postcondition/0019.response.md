The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `N` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `s` is 0 or 1, `num` is `nums[1]`**. Note that `s` and `num` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the sake of completeness, we can infer that `num` will now be `nums[2]` if `i` is incremented to 2. The value of `s` will depend on whether `nums[2]` is equal to `nums[1]`.

Since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`N` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
