The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. The initial state provides a detailed description of the variables and their relationships, but the print statement itself is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, including `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and conditions under which the state of the variables changes.
2. The `print(-1, -1)` statement is independent of the values of these variables. It simply prints `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, based on the given print statement, the output will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
