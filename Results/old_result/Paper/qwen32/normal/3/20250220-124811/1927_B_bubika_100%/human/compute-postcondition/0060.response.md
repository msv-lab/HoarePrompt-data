Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` integers. It then constructs and prints a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where each letter's occurrence in the string matches the counts specified in the list `s`.**
