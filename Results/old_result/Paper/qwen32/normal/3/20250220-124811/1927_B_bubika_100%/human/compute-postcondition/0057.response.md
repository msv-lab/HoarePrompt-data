Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `s` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, 2].
- `b` is a list containing the elements [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
- `r` is a string with the value 'abc'.
- `x` is an integer with the value 2.
- `i` is an integer with the value 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(r)
```

The variable `r` is explicitly defined as the string 'abc'. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `r`.

Output: **abc**
