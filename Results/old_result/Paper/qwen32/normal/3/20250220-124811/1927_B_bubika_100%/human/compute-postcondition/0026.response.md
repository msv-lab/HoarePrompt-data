The code `x = b.index(i)` updates the value of `x` to the index of the last element in the list `s` (which is stored in `i`) within the list `b`. Given that `b` is a list of 26 zeros, and `i` is an integer from the list `s`, the index `x` will be the position of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`. Since all elements in `b` are zeros, `x` will be `0` unless `i` is `0` and it appears at a different position in `b` (which is not the case here as all elements are zeros).

Therefore, the value of `x` will be `0` because `i` (which is an integer from the list `s`) will be found at the first position (index `0`) in the list `b` of zeros.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must contain at least one element, `r` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `i` is the last element in the new `s`**.
