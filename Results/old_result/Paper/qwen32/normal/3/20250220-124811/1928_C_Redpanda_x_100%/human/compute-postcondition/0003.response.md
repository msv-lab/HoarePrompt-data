The code snippet provided assigns the result of the function `generate(k + 1)` to the variable `rest`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the code snippet. The function `generate` is called with the argument `k + 1`, and its return value is stored in `rest`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`.**
