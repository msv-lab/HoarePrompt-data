Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is an empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime`; `factors[prime]` is 0; a value has been returned.**

A value has been returned, specifically `factor * prime_to_i`. The values of `k`, `n`, `x`, `rest`, `prime`, `prime_to_i`, and `factors[prime]` remain unchanged.
