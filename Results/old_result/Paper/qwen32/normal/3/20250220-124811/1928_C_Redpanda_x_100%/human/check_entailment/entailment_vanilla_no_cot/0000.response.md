Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `generate` are intended to find the factors of a number, but they are not used in a way that solves the given problem. The main task is to determine how many different values of `k` fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to determine the possible values of `k` such that the `n`-th position in the described sequence corresponds to the number `x`. This involves understanding the repeating pattern and checking for each possible `k` if the position `n` corresponds to the number `x`.

Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. For each test case, read `n` and `x`.
2. Iterate over possible values of `k` starting from 2 (since `k > 1`).
3. For each `k`, determine the position in the repeating sequence of length `2k - 2`.
4. Check if the number at that position in the sequence is `x`.
5. Count the number of valid `k` values.

The provided code does not implement this logic and instead focuses on factorization, which is not directly relevant to solving the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
