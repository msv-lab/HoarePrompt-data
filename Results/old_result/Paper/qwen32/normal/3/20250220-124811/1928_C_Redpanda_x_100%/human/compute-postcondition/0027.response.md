Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty list with at least one more element; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime * prime`; `factors[prime]` is 1; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded three times; `factor` is the next element in the `rest` list; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned. The loop will execute one more time.**
