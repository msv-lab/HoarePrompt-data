You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many values of `k` (where `k > 1`) fit the given constraints for the position `n` and the number `x` that Vasya received.
   - The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `k`, the sequence starts from `1` to `k`, then decreases back to `2`, and repeats.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The provided code includes two functions: `func_1` and `generate`.
   - `func_1` is supposed to factorize a number `n` and generate all possible factors.
   - `generate` recursively generates all possible products of the prime factors of `n`.

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The code does not address the problem of finding `k` based on the given `n` and `x`.
   - The code is attempting to factorize `n` and generate all its factors, which is not directly related to finding the correct `k`.
   - The `generate` function uses a global variable `primes` and `factors`, which are not defined within the scope of the function.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of `k` such that the position `n` in the sequence corresponds to the number `x`.
   - The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions, so we need to find the correct `k` that fits this pattern.
   - For a given `k`, the sequence is `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2, 1, 2, ...`. We need to find the position of `x` in this sequence and check if it matches the given `n`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to factorize `n`, which is not relevant to finding the correct `k`.
   - The code is missing the logic to determine the correct `k` based on the given `n` and `x`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
