Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is an empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is 1; `factors[prime]` is 1; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 2` times; `factor` is undefined as the loop has finished executing; a value has been returned.**

A value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded one additional time, making the total number of times it has been yielded `factors[prime] + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
