In the given initial state, we have the following information:

- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer with the current value of 2.
- `s` is a string input by the user and the current value of `s` is '00'.

However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
