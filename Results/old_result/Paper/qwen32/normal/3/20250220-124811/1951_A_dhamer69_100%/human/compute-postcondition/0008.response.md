The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which means it will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
