Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an integer; `s` is a string input by the user. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is '00', the current value of `s` remains '00', otherwise `s` is not '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then `count_1` is odd. If `count_1` is even, then either `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' or `count_1` is not 2. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then `s` has exactly two '1's and they are consecutive.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` is decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
