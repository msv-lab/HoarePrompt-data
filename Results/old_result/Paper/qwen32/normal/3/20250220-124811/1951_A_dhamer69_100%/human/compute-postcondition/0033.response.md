Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. Whether `s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2` is true or false, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` remain unchanged.**
