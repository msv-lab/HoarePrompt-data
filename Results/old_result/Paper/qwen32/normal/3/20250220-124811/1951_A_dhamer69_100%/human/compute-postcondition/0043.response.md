The code snippet `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged except for the new variable `count_1` which is assigned the count of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 2; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user; `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`.**
