To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that the condition `t > 0` is true. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

Given the state right before the loop is that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
