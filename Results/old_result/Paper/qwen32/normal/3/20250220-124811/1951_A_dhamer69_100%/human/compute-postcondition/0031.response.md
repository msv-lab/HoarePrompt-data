The `print('NO')` statement in the provided Python code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Variables Given in Initial State**:
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` is an integer that must be at least 1.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement does not reference any of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`.
   - It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Given this information, the printed output is not influenced by the values of the variables described in the initial state. The print statement will always output 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
