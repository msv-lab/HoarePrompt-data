The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1`, etc., as they are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output is straightforward:

Output: **NO**
