The code snippet `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer. This affects the value of `x_rev` while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `x` is the (y-1)-th element of `operational_list`.
- `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order.

After executing the code, `x_rev` will hold the integer value of `x` reversed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the (y-1)-th element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least `y-1` strings. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is either `x` or `'0' + x` and `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"]. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` contains either `["0", x_reversed]` or `[x_reversed]` where `x_reversed` is the string `x` reversed.**
