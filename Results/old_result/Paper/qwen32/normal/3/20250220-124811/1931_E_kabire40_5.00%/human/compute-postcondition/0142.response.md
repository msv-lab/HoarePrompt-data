The code snippet `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` appends the reverse of `val_in` to `rev_res`. Given the initial state, `x` has already been incremented by 1, and `val_in` is assigned the value of `rev_val[x]`. 

After the code executes, `rev_res` will have the reversed string of `val_in` appended to it. The values of `x` and `val_in` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is incremented by 1; `val_in` is assigned the value of `rev_val[x]`; `rev_res` is updated to include the reverse of `val_in` appended to it.**
