The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to `operational_list`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `rev_val`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `x`, `rev_res`, or `y`. The only variable that changes is `operational_list`, which now holds the list of strings from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is equal to `len(rev_val)` (which is 0), `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
