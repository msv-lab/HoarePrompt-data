Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `rev_val`, `list_len`, `max_power` retain their initial values. `x` is `x + 1`. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val` and `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of `rev_val[x]` to it.**
