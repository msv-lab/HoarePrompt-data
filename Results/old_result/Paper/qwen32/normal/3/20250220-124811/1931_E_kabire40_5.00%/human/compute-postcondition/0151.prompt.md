Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list of strings, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, `x` is equal to `len(rev_val)`, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements from `operational_list` where reversing the element does not introduce leading zeros, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, for all elements in `rev_val`. Additionally, if `10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` that do not remain the same when reversed, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is equal to the length of `rev_val`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_res` is a concatenated string of elements in `operational_list` that remain the same when reversed plus the processed elements from `rev_val` (converted back to their original form or reversed as appropriate), `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list`. If 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power` is less than the integer value of `rev_res`, then the condition holds true; otherwise, it does not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where reversing changed the length, `rev_res` is a concatenation of strings from `operational_list` where reversing did not change the length, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or plus the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd for all `x` in the range of `rev_val`, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, and `x` is equal to the length of `rev_val`. If 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power` is less than the integer value of `rev_res`, then 10




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
