The code snippet `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` takes the string `x`, reverses it, and appends the reversed string to the list `rev_val`. 

Given the initial state, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, and `x[::-1]` is the reversed version of `x`. After this operation, `rev_val` will contain this reversed string as its new last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, and `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed.**
