The given code snippet reverses the string representation of `x` and converts it back to an integer, assigning this value to `x_rev`. Therefore, `x_rev` will now hold the integer value of `x` read in reverse order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"], `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the y-th element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order, `rev_res` is either an empty string or `'0'`, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least `y` strings. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is `'0'`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains ["0"] and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**
