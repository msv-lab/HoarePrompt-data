Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. The length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`.**
