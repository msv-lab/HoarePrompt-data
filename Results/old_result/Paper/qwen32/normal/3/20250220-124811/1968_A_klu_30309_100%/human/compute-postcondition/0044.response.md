Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `current_sum`; `best_y` is `y`; `y` is `y - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `y` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that `y` is now `y - 1`. We exit the most internal loop or if statement.
