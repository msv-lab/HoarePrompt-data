Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `current_sum`; `best_y` is `y`; `y` is decremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `best_y` has been updated to the current value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `y`, which is decremented by 1.
