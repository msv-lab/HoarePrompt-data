Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`; `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` remains unchanged unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`; `best_y` remains unchanged unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`; `y` is `y - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `current_sum` is updated to the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `gcd_val`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged unless `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, in which case `max_sum` and `best_y` are updated accordingly. The value of `y` is then decremented by 1.
