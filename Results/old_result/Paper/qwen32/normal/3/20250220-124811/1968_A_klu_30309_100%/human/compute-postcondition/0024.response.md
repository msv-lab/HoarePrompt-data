Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `best_y` is `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged. The execution is interrupted by a `break` statement, which causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
