Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the inner loop where it breaks out of the loop immediately after finding the first `y` that maximizes the sum. This means that it does not continue to check other possible values of `y` that might also maximize the sum. To fix this, the `break` statement should be removed so that the loop can continue to evaluate all possible `y` values.

Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
