The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, where `y` is `y - 2`. This value is stored in the variable `gcd_val`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `x` and `y - 2`.**
