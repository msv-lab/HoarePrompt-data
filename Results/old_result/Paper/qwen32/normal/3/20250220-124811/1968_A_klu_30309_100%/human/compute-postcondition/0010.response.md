Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and the current value of `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`; `best_y` is equal to `y`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `x`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
