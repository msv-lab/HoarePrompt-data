The provided code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `y`. Since `y` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `gcd_val`. Therefore, we will represent `gcd_val` as `math.gcd(x, y)` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000), `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000), `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`**.
