The code snippet provided calculates the `current_sum` by adding `gcd_val` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, but the value of `y` is not provided in the initial state. Since `y` is not defined, we will keep it as `y` in the expression for `current_sum`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, and `gcd_val`) remain unchanged except for `current_sum`, which is newly calculated.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000), `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000), `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
