Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations:
- The variable `t` stays the same as it was initially.
- The list `test_cases` remains unchanged with the same integers.
- The list `results` now contains the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`, where `best_y` is the value of `y` that maximizes the sum of `gcd_val + y` for each corresponding `x`.
