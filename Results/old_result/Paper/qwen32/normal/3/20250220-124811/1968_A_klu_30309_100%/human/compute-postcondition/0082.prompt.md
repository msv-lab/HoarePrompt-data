Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least one integer x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `best_y` is the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it twice, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
