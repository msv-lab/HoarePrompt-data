The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. Therefore, `max_sum` now holds the value of `gcd_val + y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
