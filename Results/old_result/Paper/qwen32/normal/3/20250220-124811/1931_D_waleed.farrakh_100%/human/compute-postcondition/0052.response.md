The given code snippet calculates `rx` using the expression `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`. Here, `a` is the next element in `arr` to be processed, and `x` is one of the values from the tuple in `test_cases`.

To understand the impact of the code, we need to break down the expression:
- `-a % x` computes the negative of `a` modulo `x`.
- Adding `x` to `-a % x` ensures that the result is non-negative.
- Taking the modulo `x` again ensures that `rx` is within the range `[0, x-1]`.

The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, and `current_pair` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is a key in `freq`, then `count` is set to `freq[current_pair] + 1`. If `current_pair` is not a key in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1 and `count` remains unchanged. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, and `current_pair` remain the same, and `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
