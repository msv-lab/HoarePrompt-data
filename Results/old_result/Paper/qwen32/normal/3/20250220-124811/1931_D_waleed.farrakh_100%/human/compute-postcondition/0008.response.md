The code snippet appends a tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `idx`) remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
