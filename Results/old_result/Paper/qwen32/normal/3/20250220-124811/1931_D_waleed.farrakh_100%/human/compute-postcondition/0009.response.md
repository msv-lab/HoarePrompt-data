The code snippet `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Therefore, the new value of `idx` will be the previous value of `idx` plus 2. Given the initial state, `idx` is initially 1, so after the increment, `idx` will be 3.

The values of the other variables (`test_cases`, `data`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
