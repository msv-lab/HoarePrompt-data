Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`; `a` is `arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ry` is updated to be `a % y`, which is equivalent to `arr[0] % y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
