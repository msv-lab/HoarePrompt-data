The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The other variables (`test_cases`, `freq`, and `count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of all pairs `(rx, ry)` encountered; `count` is the final accumulated count.**
