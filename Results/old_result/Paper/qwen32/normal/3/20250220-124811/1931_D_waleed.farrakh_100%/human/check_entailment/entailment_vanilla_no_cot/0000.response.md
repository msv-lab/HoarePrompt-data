Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) in an array \(a\) such that:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)
- We need to count the number of such pairs for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of pairs of remainders \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - For each element \(a\) in the array:
     - It calculates `rx` as \((-a \% x + x) \% x\). This is equivalent to finding the positive remainder when \(-a\) is divided by \(x\).
     - It calculates `ry` as \(a \% y\).
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count of beautiful pairs.
     - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a \% x, a \% y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
   - It appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.
   - It returns the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` to get the results.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Key Points to Verify:
- The calculation of remainders and the logic to determine if a pair is beautiful seem correct.
- The use of a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders is efficient and helps in counting beautiful pairs in linear time relative to the size of the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It efficiently handles the constraints and correctly processes the input and output as per the problem statement.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
