Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is already a key in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a value of 1; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `a` is the next element in `arr` that has not been processed yet.**
