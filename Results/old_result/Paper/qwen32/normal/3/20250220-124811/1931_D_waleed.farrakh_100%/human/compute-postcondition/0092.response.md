The code snippet `freq[current_pair] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `current_pair` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration.
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value.
- `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`.
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`.
- `ry` is `a % y`.
- `current_pair` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`.
- `a` is `arr[0]`.

The value of `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it will be added with a value of 1. If it was already in `freq`, its value will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)` with its value incremented by 1; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`; `a` is `arr[0]`.**
