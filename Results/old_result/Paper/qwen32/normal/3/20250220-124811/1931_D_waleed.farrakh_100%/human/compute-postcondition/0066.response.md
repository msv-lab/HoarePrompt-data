Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with `current_pair` as a key and its value incremented by 1; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `a` is the next element in `arr` that has not been processed yet.**

In simple terms, the frequency of the `current_pair` in the `freq` dictionary has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
