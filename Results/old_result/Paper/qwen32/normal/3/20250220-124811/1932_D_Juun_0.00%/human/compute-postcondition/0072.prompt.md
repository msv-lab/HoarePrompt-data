Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `trumps` is `[]`; `answers` is a list containing the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that had more than one card of that suit, concatenated with the suit, and includes an entry in the format '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}' for each suit in `suits` that had an unpaired card; `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') has the value `None` if there were an even number of cards for that suit or no cards, and has the rank of the unpaired card for that suit if there was an odd number of cards; `suits` must be empty.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `trumps` is `[]`; `answers` is a list containing at least one element; `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') has the value `None` if there were an even number of cards for that suit or no cards, and has the rank of the unpaired card for that suit if there was an odd number of cards; `suits` must be empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `trumps` is `[]`; `answers` is a list containing at least two elements; `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') has the value `None` if there were an even number of cards for that suit or no cards, and has the rank of the unpaired card for that suit if there was an odd number of cards; `suits` must be empty; `answer` is the second element in the `answers` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `trumps` is `[]`; `answers` is a list containing at least three elements; `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') has the value `None` if there were an even number of cards for that suit or no cards, and has the rank of the unpaired card for that suit if there was an odd number of cards; `suits` must be empty; `answer` is the third element in the `answers` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
