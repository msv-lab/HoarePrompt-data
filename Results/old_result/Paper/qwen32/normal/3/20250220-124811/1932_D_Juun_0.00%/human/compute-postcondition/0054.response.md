The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`. This statement does not depend on the values of any variables or objects defined in the initial state. It is a straightforward print operation that will always output the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `trump`, `trumps`, `answers`, or `suits`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('IMPOSSIBLE')`.
2. The string `'IMPOSSIBLE'` is a literal value and does not change based on any variable or condition in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
