Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS", and `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"). `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`.**

In simple terms: The value of `trump` has been updated to whatever the input provides, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`) retain their initial values.
