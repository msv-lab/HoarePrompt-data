Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `trumps` is `[]`; `answers` is a list containing all the elements that have been printed; `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') has the value `None` if there were an even number of cards for that suit or no cards, and has the rank of the unpaired card for that suit if there was an odd number of cards; `suits` must be empty; `answer` is the last element in the `answers` list. All elements in `answers` have been printed.** 

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the loop variable `answer` will have taken on the value of the last element in the `answers` list, and this last element will have been printed. All elements in the `answers` list will have been printed in sequence. The state of the other variables remains unchanged from their initial state, except that all the answers have been printed out.
