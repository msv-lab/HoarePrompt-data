Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `rank` is the rank of the current card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the current card in `cards`; `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card in `cards` and the `rank` of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list containing one string if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, which is the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` concatenated with `suit`, or `answers` is an empty list if `suits[suit]` was `None`; the value of `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank` if it was `None` before, or it is updated to the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` if it was not `None` before; `card` is `next_card`.***
