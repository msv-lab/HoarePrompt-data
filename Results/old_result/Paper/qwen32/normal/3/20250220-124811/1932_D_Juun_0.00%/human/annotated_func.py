#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input for a set of cards and a trump suit, processes the cards to form pairs, and prints the pairs. If there are unpaired cards, it pairs them with the highest remaining trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all unpaired cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". The function does not return any value.
