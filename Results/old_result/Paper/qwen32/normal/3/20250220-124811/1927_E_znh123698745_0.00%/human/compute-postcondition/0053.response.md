To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Explanation:
- The list `answer` is constructed based on the value of `n`.
- If `n` is odd:
  - The list starts with `1`.
  - It then alternates between increasing and decreasing values starting from `n` down to `(n+1)//2`, and then repeats the middle value `(n+1)//2`.
- If `n` is even:
  - The list starts with `1`.
  - It then alternates between increasing and decreasing values starting from `n` down to `n//2`, and then includes the next value `n//2 + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*answer)
```
- The `*` operator unpacks the elements of the list `answer` and prints them separated by spaces.

### Output Determination:
- The output will be the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.

### Example Outputs:
Let's consider a few examples to illustrate the output:

1. **If `n = 5` (odd):**
   - The list `answer` will be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3, 3]`.
   - Output: **1 5 2 4 3 3**

2. **If `n = 6` (even):**
   - The list `answer` will be `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.
   - Output: **1 6 2 5 3 4**

### General Case:
- For any given `n`, the list `answer` is constructed as described above.
- The output will be the elements of this list unpacked and printed with spaces in between.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 n 2 n-1 3 n-2 ... (n+1)//2 (n+1)//2 (if n is odd) or 1 n 2 n-1 3 n-2 ... n//2 n//2+1 (if n is even)**

This description captures the general structure of the output based on the value of `n`.
