To determine what will be printed by the `print(*answer)` statement, let's analyze the `answer` list based on the given initial state.

The `answer` list is defined as:
\[ \text{answer} = [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots, n//2, n//2 + 1 \text{ if } n \text{ is even}] \]

Let's break down the pattern:
- The list starts with `1` and alternates between increasing and decreasing values.
- The first element is `1`, the second is `n`, the third is `2`, the fourth is `n-1`, and so on.
- The pattern continues until the middle of the list.
- If `n` is even, the middle elements are `n//2` and `n//2 + 1`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this. Suppose `n = 6`:
- The list would be `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.

If `n` is odd, for example `n = 5`:
- The list would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.

Now, let's consider the general case:
- The list will have `n` elements.
- The first half of the list will be `[1, 2, 3, \ldots, n//2]`.
- The second half of the list will be `[n, n-1, n-2, \ldots, n//2 + 1]` if `n` is odd, or `[n, n-1, n-2, \ldots, n//2 + 1, n//2]` if `n` is even.

Given this pattern, the `print(*answer)` statement will print all elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1 if n is even (where n is an integer and the pattern continues as described)**
