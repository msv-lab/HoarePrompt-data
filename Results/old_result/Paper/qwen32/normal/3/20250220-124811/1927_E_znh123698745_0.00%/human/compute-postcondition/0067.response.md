The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `iterations - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

So, `i` should be `iterations`, and `n` must be greater than `iterations`.

State: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` is greater than `iterations`; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
