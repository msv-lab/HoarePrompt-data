The code snippet appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. Given the initial state, `a[0]` can be 1, 2, or 3. Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive and `n` is greater than 4, the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 in `array` are 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

Here are the possible new states of `answer` based on the value of `a[0]`:

- If `a[0]` is 1, `answer` becomes `[1, n, n-1, 2]`, `[1, n, n, 2]`, `[1, n, 2, 2]`, or `[1, n, 3, 2]`, `[1, 2, 2, 2]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 2]`.
- If `a[0]` is 2, `answer` becomes `[1, n, n-1, 3]`, `[1, n, n, 3]`, `[1, n, 2, 3]`, or `[1, n, 3, 3]`, `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 3]`.
- If `a[0]` is 3, `answer` becomes `[1, n, n-1, 4]`, `[1, n, n, 4]`, `[1, n, 2, 4]`, or `[1, n, 3, 4]`, `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

The values of `a`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is either `[1, n, n-1, 2]`, `[1, n, n, 2]`, `[1, n, 2, 2]`, `[1, n, 3, 2]`, `[1, 2, 2, 2]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 2]`; or `[1, n, n-1, 3]`, `[1, n, n, 3]`, `[1, n, 2, 3]`, `[1, n, 3, 3]`, `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 3]`; or `[1, n, n-1, 4]`, `[1, n, n, 4]`, `[1, n, 2, 4]`, `[1, n, 3, 4]`, `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 4]`; `a` is either `[1, -3]`, `[2, -2]`, or `[3, -1]`; `n` is greater than 4; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 4**
