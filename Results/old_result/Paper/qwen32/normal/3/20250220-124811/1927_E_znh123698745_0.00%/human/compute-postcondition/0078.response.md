Postcondition: **The number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 2`; `n` is greater than `iterations + 1`; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `iterations + 1`. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `answer` has an additional element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `answer` has an additional element `array[a[0]]` appended to it and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
