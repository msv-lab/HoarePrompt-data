The code appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the value appended to `answer` will be `array[a[-1]]`.

Output State: **The number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 2`; `n` is greater than `iterations + 1`; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `iterations + 1`; `answer` has an additional element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it.**
