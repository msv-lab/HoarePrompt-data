The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `x`, `y`, or `e`. However, `nums` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, and `x` and `y` will need to be recalculated based on this new list to reflect the maximum and minimum values in `nums`, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is the maximum value in the new list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the new list `nums`, `e` is `e + 1`.**
