The code snippet `l = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is an input integer.**
