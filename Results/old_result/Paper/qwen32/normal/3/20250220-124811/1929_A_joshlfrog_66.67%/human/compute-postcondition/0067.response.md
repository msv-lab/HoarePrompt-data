The value of `x` is updated to the value of `nums[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `nums`, `e`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than `i + 1`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than `i + 1`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]`.**
