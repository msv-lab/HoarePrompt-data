Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 0. If `nums[0]` > `x` (initially 0), then `x` is updated to `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0 and `y` remains 100000000.**
