Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n, after potentially rearranging the elements of the array. The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) are maximized for each pair of consecutive elements, because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is as large as possible.

However, the given program does not sort the array. Instead, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array for each test case. This approach does not yield the maximum beauty as defined in the problem. The maximum beauty is not simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, but rather the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array.

For example, consider the test case `3 1 2`:
- The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array to `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.
- The given program calculates `max(1, 2, 3) - min(1, 2, 3) = 3 - 1 = 2`, which happens to be correct for this specific case, but this is not a general solution.

For the test case `5 100 54 80 43 90`:
- The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, resulting in a beauty of `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`.
- The given program calculates `max(100, 54, 80, 43, 90) - min(100, 54, 80, 43, 90) = 100 - 43 = 57`, which is again correct for this specific case, but still not a general solution.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum beauty for all possible test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
