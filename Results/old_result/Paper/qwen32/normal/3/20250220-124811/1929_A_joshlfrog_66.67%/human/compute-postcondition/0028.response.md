Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is 0, `y` is the minimum value in the new list `nums`, `e` is `e + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been changed to 0. All other variables remain with their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
