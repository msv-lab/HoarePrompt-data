The code `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `nums`, `e`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged unless `x` is updated in a subsequent part of the code, which is not shown here. Since `y` is newly assigned, it is now equal to `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than `i + 1`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `nums[i]`, `x` remains unchanged.**
