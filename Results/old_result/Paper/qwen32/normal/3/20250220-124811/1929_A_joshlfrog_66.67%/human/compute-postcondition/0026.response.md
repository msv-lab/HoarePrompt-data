The code snippet provided is `l = int(input())`, which means the variable `l` will be reassigned to the integer value of the input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`, `e` is `e + 1`**.
