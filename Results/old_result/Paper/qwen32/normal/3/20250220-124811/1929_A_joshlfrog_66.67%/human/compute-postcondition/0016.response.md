The code snippet `y = nums[i]` updates the value of `y` to the value of `nums[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `y` will be updated to `nums[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1, `x` is updated to `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `y` is `nums[1]`.**
