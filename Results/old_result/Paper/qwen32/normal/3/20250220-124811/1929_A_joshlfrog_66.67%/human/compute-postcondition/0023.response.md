Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `x` will hold the largest number from the `nums` list, and `y` will hold the smallest number from the `nums` list. All other variables like `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
