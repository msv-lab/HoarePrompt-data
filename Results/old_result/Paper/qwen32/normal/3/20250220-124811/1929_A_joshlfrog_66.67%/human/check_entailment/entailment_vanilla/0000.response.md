Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem asks us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array elements in a specific order. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in either ascending or descending order. In both cases, the maximum beauty is achieved by having the largest possible differences between consecutive elements.

The beauty of an array `a` is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Program Analysis:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and then printing their difference. This approach is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**: The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The beauty of the array is not simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values. It is the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Correct Approach:

To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. The beauty will then be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted array.

For example, given the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting it in ascending order gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \]

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. It simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
