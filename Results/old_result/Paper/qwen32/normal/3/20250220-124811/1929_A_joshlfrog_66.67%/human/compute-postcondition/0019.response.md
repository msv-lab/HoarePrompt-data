Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 2, `x` is `nums[2]`. The values of `y` remain unchanged.**

In simple terms, the variable `x` has been updated to the value of `nums[2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
