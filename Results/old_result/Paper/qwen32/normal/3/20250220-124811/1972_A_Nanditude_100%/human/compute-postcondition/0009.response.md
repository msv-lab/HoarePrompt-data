The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.**
