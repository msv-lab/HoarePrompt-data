The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has taken on a value that is one less than `n` (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `i` is 0 and `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `cnt` is 0, `j` is 1**
