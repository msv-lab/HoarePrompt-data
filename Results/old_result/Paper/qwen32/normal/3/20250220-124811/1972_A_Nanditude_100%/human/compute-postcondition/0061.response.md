Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are newly input lists of integers, `j` is `n-1`. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1. If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]` and `b[j]` is less than `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` was 0 before incrementing, otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` was 1 before incrementing.**
