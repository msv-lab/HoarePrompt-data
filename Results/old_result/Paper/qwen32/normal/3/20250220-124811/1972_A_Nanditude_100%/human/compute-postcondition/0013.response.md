The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
