Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program does not account for the need to replace the most difficult problem in `a` when a new problem is added. Instead, it simply counts how many times an element in `b` is less than an element in `a`, which does not reflect the operations described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to iteratively add new problems with difficulty `w` (where `w` can be any value that helps in reducing the maximum difficulty in `a` to be less than or equal to the corresponding value in `b`), sort the array `a` after each insertion, and remove the largest element. This process should continue until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.
