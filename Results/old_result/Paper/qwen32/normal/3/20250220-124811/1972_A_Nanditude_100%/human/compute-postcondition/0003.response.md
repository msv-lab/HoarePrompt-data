The code reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
