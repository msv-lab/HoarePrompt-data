The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers, `b` is the newly input list of integers, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `i` is 0 and `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `cnt` is 0.**
