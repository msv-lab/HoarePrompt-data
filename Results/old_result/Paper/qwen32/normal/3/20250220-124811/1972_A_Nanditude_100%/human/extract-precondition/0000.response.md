Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems. a is a list of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and b is a list of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9) representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**
