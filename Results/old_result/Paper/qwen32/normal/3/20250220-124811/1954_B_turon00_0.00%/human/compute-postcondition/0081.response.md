Postcondition: **`ans` is the new input integer `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` and `cnt` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0 if `cnt` was 0, or `n` if `cnt` was not 0. `t` remains `t - 1` and is greater than 0. `n` is greater than 0. `a` is the new input list of integers. `tmp` remains `a[0]`. `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`. `i` is incremented by 1. `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` was equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.**
