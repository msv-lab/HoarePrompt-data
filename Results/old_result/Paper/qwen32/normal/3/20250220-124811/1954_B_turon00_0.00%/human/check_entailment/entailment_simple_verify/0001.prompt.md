You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array such that it stops being beautiful. If it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, the output should be `-1`.

### Key Points:
- A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements using the described operation.
- The operation allows us to replace an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
- We need to find the minimum number of removals to prevent the array from being beautiful.
- If the array already has all elements the same, it's impossible to make it stop being beautiful, so the answer is `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
2. It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set and prints `-1` if true.
3. If not all elements are the same, it calculates the minimum segment length of consecutive elements that are the same and prints it as the answer.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program only considers segments of consecutive elements that are the same and finds the minimum length of such segments. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements in a way that disrupts the beautiful property.
- For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum segment length of consecutive elements is `1`, but removing one element (e.g., the middle `1`) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful. The program should correctly identify that removing one element is sufficient.
- The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements to disrupt the beautiful property.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only considers the minimum segment length of consecutive elements, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
