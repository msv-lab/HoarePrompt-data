Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array such that it stops being beautiful. If it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, the output should be `-1`.

### Key Points:
- A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements using the described operation.
- The operation allows us to replace an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
- We need to find the minimum number of removals to prevent the array from being beautiful.
- If the array already has all elements the same, it's impossible to make it stop being beautiful, so the answer is `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.
2. It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set and prints `-1` if true.
3. If not all elements are the same, it calculates the minimum segment length of consecutive elements that are the same and prints it as the answer.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program only considers segments of consecutive elements that are the same and finds the minimum length of such segments. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements in a way that disrupts the beautiful property.
- For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum segment length of consecutive elements is `1`, but removing one element (e.g., the middle `1`) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful. The program should correctly identify that removing one element is sufficient.
- The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements to disrupt the beautiful property.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only considers the minimum segment length of consecutive elements, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
