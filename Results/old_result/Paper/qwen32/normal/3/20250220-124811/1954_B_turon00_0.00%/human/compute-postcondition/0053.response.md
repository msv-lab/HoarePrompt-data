The code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has been incremented by 1 previously. The value of `cnt` is not specified in the initial state, so we assume it has some value that we will increase by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.**
