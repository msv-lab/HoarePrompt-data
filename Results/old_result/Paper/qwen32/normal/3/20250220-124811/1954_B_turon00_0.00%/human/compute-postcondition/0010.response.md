The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, all elements in `a` are identical; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is `n`.**
