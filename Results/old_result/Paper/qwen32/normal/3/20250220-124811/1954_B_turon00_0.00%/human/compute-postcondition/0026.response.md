The code snippet provided is `cnt = 0`, which sets the value of `cnt` to 0. This change affects the variable `cnt` only, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `i` is 2, if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**
