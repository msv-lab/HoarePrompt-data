The value of `q` is updated to `2 ** (p - 1)`. Given that `p` is `2`, the expression evaluates to `2 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `2 ** 1`, resulting in `2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `5`, `m` is `1`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `'11'`, `p` is `2`, `f` is `3`, `q` is `2`**
