Given the initial state:
- `n` is `input_n`
- `m` is `input_m`
- `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`

The task is to determine what will be printed when the `print(k)` statement is executed.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input_n`.
2. The variable `m` is assigned the value of `input_m`.
3. The variable `k` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `input_n` and `input_m`, which is calculated as `abs(input_n - input_m)`.

Since `input_n` and `input_m` are not provided with explicit values, we can only describe `k` in terms of `input_n` and `input_m`.

The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `input_n` and `input_m`.

Output: **k (where k is abs(input_n - input_m))**
