Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Natural Language: The value of `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. All other variables (`f`, `l`, `p`, `q`, `i`) remain unchanged.
