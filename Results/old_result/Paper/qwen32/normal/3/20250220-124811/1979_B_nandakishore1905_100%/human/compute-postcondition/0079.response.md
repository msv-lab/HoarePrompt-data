To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while f & f - 1 != 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the expression `f & f - 1` is not equal to `0`. 

Let's analyze the expression `f & f - 1`. This expression checks if `f` is not a power of 2. If `f` is a power of 2, then `f & (f - 1)` will be `0`. Otherwise, it will be non-zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is `5`
- `m` is `1`
- `k` is `4`
- `l` is `'11'`
- `p` is `2`
- `f` is `1`
- `q` is `2`

The only variable that affects the loop condition is `f`. The current value of `f` is `1`, which is a power of 2 (`2^0`). Therefore, `f & (f - 1)` evaluates to `1 & 0`, which is `0`. This means the loop will not execute again with the current value of `f`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `f` must not be a power of 2. We can adjust `f` to any value that is not a power of 2. For simplicity, let's choose `f` to be `3` (which is not a power of 2).

State: **`n` is `5`, `m` is `1`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `'11'`, `p` is `2`, `f` is `3`, `q` is `2`**
