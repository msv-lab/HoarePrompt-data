The code converts the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` into its binary representation as a string, removing the '0b' prefix. Therefore, the variable `l` will hold the binary string representation of `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `l` is the binary string representation of `k`.**
