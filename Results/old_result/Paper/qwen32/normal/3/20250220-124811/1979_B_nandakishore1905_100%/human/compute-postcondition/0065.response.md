Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `m` is `input_m`, `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**

This means that the variable `l` has been assigned the binary form of `k`, where `k` is the absolute difference between `input_n` and `input_m`, and the '0b' prefix that Python adds to binary literals is removed. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
