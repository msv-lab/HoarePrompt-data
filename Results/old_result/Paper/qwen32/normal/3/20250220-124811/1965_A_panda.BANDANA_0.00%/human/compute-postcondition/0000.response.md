Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The initial state for the number of piles `n` and the list of stones `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case remains unchanged.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The values of `n` and the list of stones for each test case are still to be input and have not been changed.
