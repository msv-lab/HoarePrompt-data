Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is `t-1` (indicating the last iteration of the loop); `n` is the input integer for the last test case; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input for the last test case; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l` for the last test case; `m` is the length of the list `l` for the last test case. If 1 is in the list `l`, then `e` includes the integer 1 and `m` is at least 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in the list `l`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will have reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed for all `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` will hold the values corresponding to the last test case. The set `e` will contain unique stones from the last test case's list `l`, and `m` will be the count of stones in that list. The output for each test case (either "Alice" or "Bob") will have been printed based on whether the number 1 was present in the list `l` for that test case.
