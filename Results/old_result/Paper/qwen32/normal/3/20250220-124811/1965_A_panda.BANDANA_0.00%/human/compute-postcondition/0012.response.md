Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `i` is 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If 1 is in the list `l`, then `e` includes the integer 1 and `m` is at least 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
