The `print('Bob')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and independent of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `e`, and `m` described in the initial state. The `print` function outputs the string 'Bob' exactly as it is provided.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `e`, `m`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string 'Bob'.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
