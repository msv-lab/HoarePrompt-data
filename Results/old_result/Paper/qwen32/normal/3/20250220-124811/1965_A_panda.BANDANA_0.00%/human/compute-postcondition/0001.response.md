The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1, because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1` if `t` is greater than 0. The initial state of `t` is already given as an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure that the loop can execute, as it is already within the required range.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and is automatically initialized by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need to be modified for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized**
