Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The initial state for the number of piles `n` and the list of stones `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `i` is not yet initialized; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If 1 is in the list `l`, then `e` includes the integer 1 and `m` is at least 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `i` is 1; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If 1 is in the list `l`, then `e` includes the integer 1 and `m` is at least 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `i` is 2; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. Regardless of whether 1 is in the list `l` or not, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `e`, and `m` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
