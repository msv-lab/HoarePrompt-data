The code snippet `new_arr.append(arr[right])` appends the element from `arr` at index `right` to `new_arr`. Given that `right` is `n - 3` and `n` must be at least 5, `right` is at least 2. The value of `left` is not affected by this operation. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `right` remains `n - 3`.

Output State: **`left` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `right` is `n - 3`, `new_arr` has an additional element `arr[right]` appended to it.**
