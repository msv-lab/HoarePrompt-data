Reasoning:  
To determine the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This can be achieved by arranging the elements of the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The provided program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Let's break down the steps of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Alternating Construction**: A new array is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
4. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the new array is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. **Output**: The maximum beauty for each test case is printed.

This method ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
