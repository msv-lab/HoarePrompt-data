The code snippet `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` increments `max_beauty` by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, where `i` is 3.

Given `i` is 3, the expression `abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])` is calculated and added to `max_beauty`.

Output State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`; `n` must be greater than 3; `i` is 3.**
