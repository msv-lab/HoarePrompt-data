You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    #State: - `left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates.
    #- `right` will be equal to `left - 1`.
    #- `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes.
    #
    #Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, the final state can be described as:
    #- `left` will be `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.
    #- `right` will be `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even.
    #- `new_arr` will be a list where the elements are arranged in the described alternating order.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: `left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It calculates and returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
