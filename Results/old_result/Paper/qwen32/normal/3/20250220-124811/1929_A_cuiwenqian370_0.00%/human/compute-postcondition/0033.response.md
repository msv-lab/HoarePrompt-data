The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can continue.

Given the context, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` where `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 3; `i` is 3**
