Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program first sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: It then rearranges the sorted array in such a way that the largest and smallest elements are placed alternately. This is done by using two pointers (`left` and `right`) to pick elements from the sorted array from both ends and appending them to a new array (`new_arr`).
3. **Calculating Beauty**: Finally, it calculates the beauty of the rearranged array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 2 1 3`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Rearranged: `[1, 3, 2]` or `[3, 1, 2]` (both yield the same beauty)
  - Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2`
  
- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `3 69 69 69`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Rearranged: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
  
- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Rearranged: `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]`
  - Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (54 - 100) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 90) = 57`
  
- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Rearranged: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 4) + (3 - 3) = 1`
  
- **Test Case 5**:
  - Input: `2 2 1`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Rearranged: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
  
In all the test cases, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
