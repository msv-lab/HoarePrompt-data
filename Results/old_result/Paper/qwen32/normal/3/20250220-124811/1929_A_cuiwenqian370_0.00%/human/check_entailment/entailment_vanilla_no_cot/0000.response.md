To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze if the algorithm implemented in the function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to arrange the elements of the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The given program sorts the array and then rearranges it by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements and thus the beauty of the array.

Let's verify if this strategy works correctly:

1. **Sorting the Array:** The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Rearranging the Array:** The program alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements to a new array. This means the new array will have the largest element, then the smallest, then the second largest, then the second smallest, and so on.
3. **Calculating the Beauty:** The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the newly arranged array.

This strategy works because placing the largest and smallest elements next to each other maximizes the difference between them, and this pattern continues throughout the array. Therefore, the beauty of the array is maximized.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_1`, the program should correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Thus, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
