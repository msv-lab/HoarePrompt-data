Output State: **`left` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `right` is `n - 4`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` has `arr[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `new_arr` has `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` appended to it in that order.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is decremented by 1, so `right` becomes `n - 4`. The values of `left` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition for appending to `new_arr` is also updated to reflect the new value of `right`.
