The code snippet appends the element at index `right` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. The value of `right` depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is 2, `right` is 1; otherwise, `right` is `n - 2`.

Given the initial state, `left` remains unchanged. The value of `right` is either 1 or `n - 2`, and `new_arr` will have the element at index `right` of `arr` appended to it.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 1 if `n` is 2; otherwise, `right` is `n - 2`; `new_arr` has `arr[right]` appended to it.**
