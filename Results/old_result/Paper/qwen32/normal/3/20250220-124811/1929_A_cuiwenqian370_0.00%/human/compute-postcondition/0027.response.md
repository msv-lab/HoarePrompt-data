To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it manipulates the variables `left`, `right`, and `new_arr`.

The loop iterates while `left` is less than or equal to `right`. In each iteration:
- If `left` equals `right`, it appends `arr[left]` (or equivalently `arr[right]`) to `new_arr`.
- Otherwise, it appends `arr[right]` and then `arr[left]` to `new_arr`.
- `left` is incremented by 1, and `right` is decremented by 1.

This process continues until `left` surpasses `right`, meaning all elements of `arr` have been processed and added to `new_arr` in a specific order: the largest remaining element, then the smallest remaining element, and so on.

**Final Output State:**
- `left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates.
- `right` will be equal to `left - 1`.
- `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes.

Given the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, the final state can be described as:
- `left` will be `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.
- `right` will be `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even.
- `new_arr` will be a list where the elements are arranged in the described alternating order.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`left` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even; `right` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even; `new_arr` contains elements of `arr` in alternating order starting from the largest and smallest remaining elements.**
