Output State: **`left` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `right` is `n - 3`, `new_arr` has an additional element `arr[right]` appended to it, and `new_arr` has an additional element `arr[left]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `left` remains 2. The condition that `n` must be at least 5 is still valid. The value of `right` is still `n - 3`. The list `new_arr` now includes an additional element which is `arr[left]`.
