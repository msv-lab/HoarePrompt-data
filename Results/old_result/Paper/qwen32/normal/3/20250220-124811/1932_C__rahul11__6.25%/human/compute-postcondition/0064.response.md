Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa), and `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa).**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `c`, which is now assigned the value 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
