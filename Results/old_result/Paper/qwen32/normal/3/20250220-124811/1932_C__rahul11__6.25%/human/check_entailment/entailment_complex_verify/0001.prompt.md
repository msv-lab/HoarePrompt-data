You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of the division operations modulo `m` and `MOD`, `ans` is `1`, `c` is `n`, `l` is equal to `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` containing 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a list `res` of `n` integers where each element is the result of a series of division operations on the product of all elements in `a`, modulo `m` and `10^9 + 6`, based on the directions specified in `s`. It then prints the list `res` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Two integers `n` (length of the array) and `m` (modulus).
     - An array `a` of `n` integers.
     - A string `s` of `n` characters ('L' or 'R') representing commands.

2. **Processing:**
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - Output the remainder of the product of all elements in the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array `a`.
     - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `n` integers representing the remainders as described above.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `MOD` to \(10^9 + 6\), which is not used in the calculations and is unnecessary for the problem.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s`.

2. **First Calculation:**
   - It calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then calculates the remainder of `ans` divided by `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - It initializes `c` (index for `res`), `l` (left pointer), and `r` (right pointer).
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element (`arr[l]`), updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` divided by `m`, and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element (`arr[r]`), updates `res[c]` with the remainder of `ans` divided by `m`, and decrements `r`.
     - It increments `c` to move to the next position in `res`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, it prints the array `res`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Division:** The program uses integer division (`//`) to update `ans` after removing an element. This is incorrect because integer division does not preserve the product when the elements are not factors of each other. Instead, it should use modular multiplicative inverse to correctly update the product under modulo `m`.
- **Unnecessary MOD:** The use of `MOD` in the calculations is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because it does not align with the problem requirements. The calculations should only involve modulo `m`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is **incorrect** due to the incorrect handling of the product update when elements are removed from the array. The use of integer division and an unnecessary `MOD` value further contributes to the incorrectness.

**Correctness: False**
