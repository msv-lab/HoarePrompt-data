Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is also `ans % m % MOD`, the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is not 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 1`.**
