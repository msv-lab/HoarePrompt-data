The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `r` was initially `n - 1`. After executing `r -= 1`, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is also `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0, `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. Additionally, the character at index `k` in `s` is not 'L'**.
