The code snippet `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `ans * i`, `i` is the next element in `arr`.** 

In simpler terms, `ans` has been updated to be the product of its previous value and `i`. All other variables retain their initial values.
