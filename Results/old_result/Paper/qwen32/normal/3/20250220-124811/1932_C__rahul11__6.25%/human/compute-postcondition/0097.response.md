To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `res` is a list of `n` integers where:
   - The first `n-1` elements are `1 % m`.
   - The last element is `0`.

2. The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the `res` list and print each element separated by a space.

Given the structure of `res`, we can describe the output as follows:

- The first `n-1` elements of `res` are all `1 % m`. Since `1 % m` will always be `1` for any integer `m` greater than 1, and `0` if `m` is `1`, we can say:
  - If `m > 1`, each of the first `n-1` elements is `1`.
  - If `m == 1`, each of the first `n-1` elements is `0`.

- The last element of `res` is `0`.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of `n-1` elements that are either `1` or `0` (depending on the value of `m`), followed by a `0`.

The exact numerical value of `m` is not provided, so we must account for both possibilities.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 0 (where there are n-1 ones or zeros depending on m, followed by a 0)**

To make it clearer:
- If `m > 1`, the output is: **1 1 1 ... 1 0 (n-1 ones followed by a 0)**
- If `m == 1`, the output is: **0 0 0 ... 0 0 (n-1 zeros followed by a 0)**

Since we don't have the exact value of `m`, we provide the general form:

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 0 (where there are n-1 ones or zeros depending on m, followed by a 0)**

To ensure clarity, we can specify the two cases:

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 0 (where there are n-1 ones if m > 1, or n-1 zeros if m == 1, followed by a 0)**
