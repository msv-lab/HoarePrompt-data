The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the variable `ans` by appending a character to it. The character is determined by the value of `s[j] + 97`, where `s[j]` is either 0 or 1 based on the initial state provided.

Given that `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1:
- If `s[j]` is 0, `chr(s[j] + 97)` evaluates to `chr(97)`, which is `'a'`.
- If `s[j]` is 1, `chr(s[j] + 97)` evaluates to `chr(98)`, which is `'b'`.

Since `ans` was initially `'a'`, after the operation:
- If `s[j]` is 0, `ans` becomes `'aa'`.
- If `s[j]` is 1, `ans` becomes `'ab'`.

The other variables (`i`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `'aa'` if `s[j]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `'ab'`, `j` is the next element in `array`**.
