Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements set to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` set to 1 and all other elements set to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element; `ans` is a string that has an additional 'a' appended to it; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` set to 2 and all other elements set to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element; `ans` is a string that has an additional character appended to it, specifically 'a' if `s[j]` is 0, or 'b' if `s[j]` is 1; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` set to 3 and all other elements set to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element; `ans` is a string that has an additional character appended to it, specifically 'a' if `s[j]` is 0, or 'b' if `s[j]` is 1; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration; `j` is the next element in `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
