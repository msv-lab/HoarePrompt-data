You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
Given a trace array `a` of length `n`, we need to construct a string `s` of length `n` such that the trace of `s` matches `a`. The trace of a string `s` is defined as an array `a` where `a[i]` is the number of previous indices `j` (with `j < i`) such that `s[i] == s[j]`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **String Construction**:
   - It initializes a list `s` of length `n` with all zeros. This list will keep track of how many times each character has been used so far.
   - It also initializes an empty string `ans` which will store the final string.

3. **Constructing the String**:
   - For each element `j` in the trace array `a`:
     - It appends to `ans` the character corresponding to the number of times the character at index `j` has been used so far. This is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, which converts the count to a lowercase letter ('a' for 0, 'b' for 1, etc.).
     - It then increments `s[j]` by 1 to reflect that this character has been used once more.

### Correctness Check
- **Character Assignment**: The program uses `chr(s[j] + 97)` to assign characters. For the first occurrence of a character, `s[j]` is 0, so `chr(0 + 97)` is 'a'. The second occurrence will use `chr(1 + 97)` which is 'b', and so on.
- **Trace Matching**: The key part of the program is that it uses the value in `s[j]` to determine which character to use next. Since `s[j]` keeps track of how many times each character has been used, it ensures that the trace condition (`a[i]` being the number of previous occurrences of `s[i]`) is satisfied.
- **Multiple Valid Strings**: The program constructs one valid string, but there could be multiple valid strings for a given trace. The program does not need to find all valid strings, just one, which it does correctly.

### Conclusion
The program correctly constructs a string `s` that matches the given trace `a` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
