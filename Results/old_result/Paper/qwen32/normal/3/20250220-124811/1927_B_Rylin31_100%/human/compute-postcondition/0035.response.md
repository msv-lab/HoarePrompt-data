The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `array`. The variables `i`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers from the input.**
