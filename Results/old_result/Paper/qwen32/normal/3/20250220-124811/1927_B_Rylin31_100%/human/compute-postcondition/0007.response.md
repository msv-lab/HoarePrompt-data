The given code snippet is `s[j] += 1`. This line increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `ans` is a string with the value 'a'.

The only change after executing `s[j] += 1` is that the element at index `j` in the list `s` will be incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `l`, `array`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a string with the value 'a'.**
