The code snippet provided is `ans = ''`, which reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty string. This action does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is the new input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements set to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
