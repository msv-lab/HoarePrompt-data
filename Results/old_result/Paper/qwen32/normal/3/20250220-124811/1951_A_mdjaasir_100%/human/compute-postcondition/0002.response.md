`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `start`, `end`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is an input integer.**
