Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value of the user's input; `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. If `count` is 0, no further changes occur. If `count` is greater than 0, the conditions on `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain as specified. Specifically, if `count` is greater than 2 and even, or if `count` is less than 2 or odd, the conditions remain unchanged. Additionally, if `count` is equal to 2, the element immediately following the first '1' in `a` is either not '1' or is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value of the user's input; `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. If `count` is 0, no further changes occur. If `count` is greater than 0, the conditions on `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain as specified. Specifically, if `count` is greater than 2 and even, or if `count` is less than 2 or odd, the conditions remain unchanged. Additionally, if `count` is equal to 2, the element immediately following the first '1' in `a` is either not '1' or is '1'. If `count` is equal to 2, the condition `a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1'` holds true, meaning the element immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is the new input string provided by the user; `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. The state remains unchanged regardless of the value of `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
