Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that represents a specific count or measurement based on the given inputs. The final printed value for each test case is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.**
