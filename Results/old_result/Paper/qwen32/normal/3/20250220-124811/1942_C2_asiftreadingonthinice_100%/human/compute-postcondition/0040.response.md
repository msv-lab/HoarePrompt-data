Postcondition: **`tt` is any value, `t` is any value, `n` is 10, `x` is any value, `y` is any value, `ii` is any value, `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`, and `tmp` is `[2, 2]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `ii - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - i + 1` and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2` plus the count of pairs with difference 2 plus `i`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged and `ans` remains `x + y - 2` plus the count of pairs with difference 2.**
