The code snippet appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the precondition, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, the value being appended is a positive integer.

Output State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
