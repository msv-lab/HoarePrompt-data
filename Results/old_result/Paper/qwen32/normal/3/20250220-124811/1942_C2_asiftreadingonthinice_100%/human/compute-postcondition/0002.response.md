The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `x`, and `y` have certain constraints, but the code only updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the input, and does not affect the other variables (`tt`, `t`, `ii`).

Here is the output state after the code has been executed:

Output State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the integers read from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
