Postcondition: **`tt`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ii`, `a` are as described in the precondition. `ans` is initialized to `x + y - 2` plus the count of pairs with difference 2. `tmp` is a list of `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` for even differences not equal to 2. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
