Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`, `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, and `tmp` includes `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2. Additionally, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` also includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. `tmp` is sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are input integers. `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`. If `y >= i - 1`, then `y` is further decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is incremented by `i`. If `y < i - 1`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements such that `a[1] - a[0]` is even and not equal to 2, and `tmp` includes `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `tmp` is sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are input integers, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp` up to the current `i`. If `y >= i - 1`, then `y` is further decreased by `i - 1`. `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions provided, `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements such that `a[1] - a[0]` is even and not equal to 2, and `tmp` includes `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `tmp` is sorted in ascending order, and `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`. If `y < i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are input integers, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp` up to the current `i`. If `y >= i - 1`, `y` is further decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is adjusted by adding `tmp[j+1]`. If `y < i - 1`, `y` remains as is and `ans` is not adjusted by `tmp[j+1]`. `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1` in both cases, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements such that `a[1] - a[0]` is even and not equal to 2, and `tmp` includes `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `tmp` is sorted in ascending order, and `i` is `tmp[j+1]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `y < i - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
