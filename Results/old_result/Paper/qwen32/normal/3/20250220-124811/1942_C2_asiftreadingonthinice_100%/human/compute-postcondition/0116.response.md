Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements, `tmp` is an empty list, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2**
