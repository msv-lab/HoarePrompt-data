Postcondition: **`tt` is any value, `t` is any value, `n` is 10, `x` is any value, `ii` is any value, `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`, `tmp` is `[2, 2, 3]`, and `i` is 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by 2 and `y` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `y`.**
