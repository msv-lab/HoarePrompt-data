Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `v` is `na_frente - 1`; `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, where `v` is `na_frente - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
