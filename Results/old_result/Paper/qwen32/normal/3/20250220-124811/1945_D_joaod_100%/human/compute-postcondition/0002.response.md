The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final` respectively. The initial state of `t` and `cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers as read from the input.**
