Postcondition: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
