Initial State: `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input.

The code provided initializes a variable `total` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `total` is 0.**
