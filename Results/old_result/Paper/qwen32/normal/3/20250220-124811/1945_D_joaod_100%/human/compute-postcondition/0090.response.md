The given Python code snippet updates the `total` variable by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.
