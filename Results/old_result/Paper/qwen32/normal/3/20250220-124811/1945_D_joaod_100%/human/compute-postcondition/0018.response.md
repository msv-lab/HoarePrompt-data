Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `v` is an integer such that `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
