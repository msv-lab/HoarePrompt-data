The code snippet provided updates the value of `x` to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found, `x` is set to -1. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is the new string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is `len(arr) - x - 1` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `y` is -1, `z` is an empty string if `x` is -1, otherwise `z` is `arr[x:n - len(arr) + x + 1]` in the previous `arr`.**
