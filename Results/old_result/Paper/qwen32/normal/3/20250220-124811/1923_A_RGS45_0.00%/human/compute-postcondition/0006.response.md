To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and how it affects the variables given in the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is the string input provided by the user
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `y` is `len(arr) - x - 1` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `y` is -1

Code snippet:
```python
z = arr[x:n - y]
```

Let's break down the code snippet:
- `z` is assigned the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.

Now, let's consider the possible values and conditions:
1. If `x` is -1 (meaning '1' is not found in `arr`), then `y` is also -1. In this case, the expression `n - y` becomes `n - (-1)` or `n + 1`. Since `arr` has a length of `len(arr)`, trying to access `arr[x:n - y]` where `x` is -1 and `n - y` is `n + 1` would result in an empty string because the start index is out of bounds and the end index is greater than the length of the string. However, Python's slicing handles this gracefully by returning an empty string.
2. If `x` is not -1, then `y` is `len(arr) - x - 1`. The expression `n - y` becomes `n - (len(arr) - x - 1)` or `n - len(arr) + x + 1`. The substring `arr[x:n - y]` will start at index `x` and go up to, but not including, index `n - len(arr) + x + 1`.

Based on these conditions, the value of `z` will be an empty string if `x` is -1, or a substring of `arr` starting from `x` up to `n - len(arr) + x + 1` if `x` is not -1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is `len(arr) - x - 1` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `y` is -1, `z` is an empty string if `x` is -1, otherwise `z` is `arr[x:n - len(arr) + x + 1]`.**
