The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string. If '1' is not found, `y` will be assigned -1. The index `y` in the reversed string corresponds to the index from the end of the original string `arr`.

Given that `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` can be related to `x` as follows:
- If `x` is -1, then `y` is also -1 because '1' is not present in the string.
- If `x` is not -1, then `y` is the index of '1' from the end of the string, which can be calculated as `len(arr) - x - 1`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is `len(arr) - x - 1` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `y` is -1.**
