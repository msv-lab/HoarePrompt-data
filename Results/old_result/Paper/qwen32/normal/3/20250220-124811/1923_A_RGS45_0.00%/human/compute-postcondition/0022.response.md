Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer provided by the user, `arr` is the last string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is `arr[x:n - y]` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has executed `t` times and is now complete. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` will be the last integer input, `arr` will be the last string input, `x` will be the index of the first '1' in `arr`, `y` will be the index of the first '1' in the reversed `arr`, and `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n - y` in `arr` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `z` will be an empty string.
