### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

The program's objective is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. To achieve this, the program calculates the number of free cells ('0's) between the first and last occurrence of a chip ('1') in the ribbon configuration.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the ribbon configuration as a string.
2. **Finding First and Last '1'**: It finds the position of the first '1' (`x`) and the position of the last '1' (`y` from the end, hence `n - y` gives the actual index).
3. **Counting '0's**: It slices the string from the first '1' to the last '1' and counts the number of '0's in this substring. This count represents the minimum number of moves needed to bring all chips together.

The logic seems correct because:
- The number of '0's between the first and last '1' indeed represents the minimum number of moves required to group all chips together without any gaps between them.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - First '1' at index 1, last '1' at index 6.
   - Substring: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Number of '0's: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - Only one '1', so no moves needed.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - All '1's are already together.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - First '1' at index 0, last '1' at index 4.
   - Substring: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Number of '0's: 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - First '1' at index 1, last '1' at index 7.
   - Substring: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Number of '0's: 3
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

All test cases match the expected output as per the problem statement, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to group all chips into a single contiguous block.

**Correctness: True**
