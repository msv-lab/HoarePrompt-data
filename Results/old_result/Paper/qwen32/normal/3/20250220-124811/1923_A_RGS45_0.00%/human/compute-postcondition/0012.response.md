The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This new index is assigned to `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 1000
- `n` is the new input integer
- `arr` is the new string input provided by the user
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `y` is `len(arr) - x - 1` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `y` is -1
- `z` is an empty string if `x` is -1, otherwise `z` is `arr[x:n - len(arr) + x + 1]` in the previous `arr`

After executing the code, `y` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `z` remain unchanged.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is the new string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is an empty string if `x` is -1, otherwise `z` is `arr[x:n - len(arr) + x + 1]` in the previous `arr`.**
