The provided code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not affected by this line of code and remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. At least one `a_i` is 1 in each test case.**
