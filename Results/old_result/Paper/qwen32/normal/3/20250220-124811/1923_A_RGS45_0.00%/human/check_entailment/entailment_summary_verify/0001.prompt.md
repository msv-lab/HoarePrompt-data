You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each character is either '0' or '1'). For each test case, it calculates the number of '0's between the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to move chips in a ribbon (an array of cells) such that all chips form a contiguous block with no free cells between them. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the number of cells `n`.
2. Reads the string `arr` representing the ribbon.
3. Finds the first occurrence of '1' (chip) from the left (`x`).
4. Finds the first occurrence of '1' from the right (`y`).
5. Extracts the substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip (inclusive).
6. Counts the number of '0's in this substring `z` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Substring Extraction**: The substring `z` is extracted from `x` to `n - y`, which is incorrect. The correct way to extract the substring from the first chip to the last chip is from `x` to `n - y - 1` (or `len(arr) - y - 1`).
2. **Logic Flaw**: The program assumes that the minimum number of operations is simply the count of '0's between the first and last chip. However, this is not always true. The correct approach involves calculating the number of operations required to move each chip to the leftmost possible free cell in the contiguous block.

### Correct Approach
The correct approach to solve this problem is:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the total number of operations required to move all chips to form a contiguous block. This can be done by calculating the distance each chip needs to move to reach its position in the contiguous block.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a contiguous block.
