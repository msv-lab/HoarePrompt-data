Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer with the current value of 2, and `p` is a list of 2 distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= 2, p_i != i; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next 2 elements are integers read from the input if `n` is 2. Otherwise, the program does not print anything and finishes executing without modifying `t`, `n`, `p`, or `v`.**
