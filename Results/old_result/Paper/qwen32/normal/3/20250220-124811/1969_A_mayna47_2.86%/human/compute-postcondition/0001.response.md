The code snippet creates a new list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers, all initialized to 0.**
