You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The program does not print anything and finishes executing the loop.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer with the current value of 2, and `p` is a list of 2 distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= 2, p_i != i; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next 2 elements are integers read from the input if `n` is 2. Otherwise, the program does not print anything and finishes executing without modifying `t`, `n`, `p`, or `v`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least two friends come to the party. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if there exists a triplet of friends where `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, then only 2 invitations are needed. However, this condition does not guarantee that at least two friends will come to the party in all scenarios.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
4
2 3 4 1

Expected Output:
3
```
Explanation of the Counterexample:
In this case, `v = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]`. There is no `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`:
- For `i = 1`, `v[v[v[1]]] = v[v[2]] = v[3] = 4`
- For `i = 2`, `v[v[v[2]]] = v[v[3]] = v[4] = 1`
- For `i = 3`, `v[v[v[3]]] = v[v[4]] = v[1] = 2`
- For `i = 4`, `v[v[v[4]]] = v[v[1]] = v[2] = 3`

Since there is no such triplet, the program will print `3` as expected. However, the program incorrectly prints `2` for some cases where `v[v[v[i]]] == i` does not ensure the minimum number of invitations.

Another problematic case:
```
Input:
1
5
3 1 5 4 2

Expected Output:
3
```
Explanation of the Counterexample:
In this case, `v = [0, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2]`. There is a triplet for `i = 2`:
- `v[v[v[2]]] = v[v[1]] = v[3] = 5`, which is not equal to `2`
- `v[v[v[3]]] = v[v[5]] = v[2] = 1`, which is not equal to `3`
- `v[v[v[4]]] = v[v[4]] = v[1] = 3`, which is not equal to `4`
- `v[v[v[5]]] = v[v[2]] = v[1] = 3`, which is not equal to `5`
- `v[v[v[1]]] = v[v[3]] = v[5] = 2`, which is equal to `1`

However, the program will print `2` because `v[v[v[2]]] == 1`, but this does not mean only 2 invitations are needed. In this case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases correctly.
