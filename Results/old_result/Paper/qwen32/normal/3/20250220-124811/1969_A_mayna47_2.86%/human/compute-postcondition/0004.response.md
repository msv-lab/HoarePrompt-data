Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
2. `n` is an integer with the current value of 2.
3. `p` is a list of 2 distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= 2, and `p_i` != `i`.
4. `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next 2 elements are integers read from the input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(2)` directly prints the integer `2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` are not used in the print statement, so they do not influence the output.

### Output:
Output: **2**
