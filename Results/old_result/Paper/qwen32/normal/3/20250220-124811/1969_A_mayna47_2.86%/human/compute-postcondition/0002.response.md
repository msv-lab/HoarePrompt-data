The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and then maps these integers into a new list which is prefixed with a 0. This new list replaces the previous list `v`.

Given that `v` was initially a list of `n + 1` integers all set to 0, after the code execution, `v` will be `[0]` followed by the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next n elements are integers read from the input.**
