The given initial state does not provide any information about variables or objects that would influence the execution of the `print(3)` statement. The statement is straightforward and simply prints the integer `3`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions that the program does not print anything and finishes executing the loop. This information is irrelevant to the `print(3)` statement since it does not depend on any variables or conditions that might be affected by the loop.
2. The `print(3)` statement directly prints the integer `3`.

Thus, the output will be the integer `3`.

Output: **3**
