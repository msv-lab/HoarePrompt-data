Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that are trumps; `answers` is a list containing strings of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for suits that had no non-trump cards or had pairs of non-trump cards already added to `answers`.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 50, `n` is 8, `trump` is 'H', `trumps` is ['A', 'K'], `answers` is ['23', '45', 'HQ QH'], `suits` is {'C': None, 'D': ['6', '7'], 'H': None, 'S': None}, and `rank` is None.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 50, `n` is 8, `trump` is 'H', `trumps` is either `['A']` or `[]`, `answers` is either `['23', '45', 'HQ QH']` or `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneSH KH']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': ['6', '7'], 'H': None, 'S': None}`, `suit` is 'S', and `rank` is None. If `trumps` is not empty, then `trumps` is `['A']` and `answers` is `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneSH KH']`. Otherwise, the function returns None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 50, `n` is 8, `trump` is 'H', `trumps` is either `[]` or `['A']`, `answers` is either `['23', '45', 'HQ QH']`, `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneSH KH']`, `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneHA H']`, or `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneSH KH', 'NoneHA H']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': ['6', '7'], 'H': None, 'S': None}`, `suit` is 'H', and `rank` is `None`. If `trumps` is `[]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `trumps` is `['A']`, the program returns nothing (None).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
