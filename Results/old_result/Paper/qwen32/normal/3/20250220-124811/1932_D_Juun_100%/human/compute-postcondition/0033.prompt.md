Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; if `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the current card; otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is either an empty list or a list with one additional string entry formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value for the key `suit` is either `None` or `rank`; `rank` is the rank of the card (a character from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}); and `suit` is the suit of the card (a character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}). If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` contains the `rank` of the current card. If `suit` does not equal `trump`, `answers` is updated with a string formed by the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character, and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` if it was `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `rank` is the rank of the current card (a character from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}); `suit` is the suit of the current card (a character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}); the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; if `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the current card; otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is either an empty list or a list with one additional string entry formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value for the key `suit` is either `None` or `rank`; `card` is the next card in the list of card descriptions. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` contains the `rank` of the current card. If `suit` does not equal `trump`, `trumps` remains an empty list. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` includes a new string entry formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character, and `suits[suit]` remains unchanged. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank`, and `answers` includes a new string entry formed by joining `rank` and `suit`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `rank` is the rank of the current card (a character from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}); `suit` is the suit of the current card (a character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}); the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is either an empty list or a list with one additional string entry formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', and the value for the key `suit` is updated to `rank` if `suits[suit]` is not `None` and `suit` is not equal to `trump`; `card` is the next card in the list of card descriptions; `rank` and `suit` have been updated to the rank and suit of `card`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
