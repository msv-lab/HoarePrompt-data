Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes an additional element 'Alice', `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the list `answers` now has one more element, which is 'Alice'. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
