Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2]` <= `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` is determined based on the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` and the values of `clues[1]`, `clues[2]`, and `clues[4]`. Specifically, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and either `clues[1] - clues[5]` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'. If the absolute difference is 1 or less and either `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice'.**
