Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, and `clues[0] != 1`. Additionally, it is not the case that both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even or both are odd. This means one of them is even and the other is odd.**
