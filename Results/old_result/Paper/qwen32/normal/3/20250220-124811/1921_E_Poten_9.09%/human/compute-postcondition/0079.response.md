Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it is not the case that `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`. If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even or both are odd, and `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains the string 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` and the values of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. If one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd, and `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains the string 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` and the values of `clues[1]`, `clues[2]`, and `clues[4]`.**
