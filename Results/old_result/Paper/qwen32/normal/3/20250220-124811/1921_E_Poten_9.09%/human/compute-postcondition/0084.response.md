The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the `answers` list. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `answers` list now contains one additional element, `'Bob'`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', and now includes 'Bob', `i` is `i + 1`.**
