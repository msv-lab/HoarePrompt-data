Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` contains 'Draw' appended to it. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string `'Bob'`.**
