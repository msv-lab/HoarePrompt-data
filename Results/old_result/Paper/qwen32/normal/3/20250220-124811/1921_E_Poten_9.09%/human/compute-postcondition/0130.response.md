The code snippet appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. This means that the list `answers` will now contain one additional element, which is the string `'Bob'`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` contains the string `'Bob'`.**
