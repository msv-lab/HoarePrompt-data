Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and either `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is equal to 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `test_cases` still equals `t`. The `answers` list now contains the string 'Draw'. The `clues` list remains unchanged as a list of integers obtained from the input, and the condition that either `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is equal to 1 still holds.
