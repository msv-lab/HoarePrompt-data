The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `clues`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `t` and `test_cases` retain their initial values, `clues` is now a list of integers read from the input, and `i` remains as `i + 1`.
