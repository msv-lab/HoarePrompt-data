Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2]` <= `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw' if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and either `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. If the absolute difference is 1 or less and either `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw' if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and either `clues[5] - 1` or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. If the absolute difference is 1, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw' if either `clues[5] - 2` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` is `['Alice']`.**
