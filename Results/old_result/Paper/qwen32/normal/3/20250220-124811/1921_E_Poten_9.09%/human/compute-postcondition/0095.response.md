Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes 'Draw' as its last element, `i` is `i + 1`.**

The value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The value of `test_cases` is still equal to `t`. The `clues` list retains its previous values as it was not modified. The `answers` list now includes an additional element, which is the string 'Draw'. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1.
