To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's first understand the loop and the given conditions.

The loop provided is:
```python
for j in answers:
    print(j)
```

This loop iterates over each element `j` in the list `answers` and prints it. The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases and also the number of elements in the `answers` list.

Given that the loop has already executed 3 times, it means `t` must be at least 3. Since the loop will execute `t` times, and we are now at the end of all iterations, `t` iterations have been completed. Therefore, `i` should be 0 as it indicates all iterations are completed.

The `answers` list contains `t` elements, each either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. Since the loop has printed all elements in `answers`, all elements have been processed.

The final output state should reflect that all iterations are completed, and all elements in `answers` have been printed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing `t` elements, each either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations are completed, `t` is still a positive integer within the given range, `test_cases` equals `t`, `clues` remains a list of integers, `i` is 0 indicating all iterations are done, and `answers` contains `t` elements, each being either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
