Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes an additional element 'Draw', `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural language: The value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The variable `test_cases` remains equal to `t`. The list `clues` retains its previous values of integers obtained from the input. The list `answers` now includes an additional element, which is the string 'Draw'. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
