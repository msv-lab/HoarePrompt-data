Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2]` <= `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. If either `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Alice'`.**
