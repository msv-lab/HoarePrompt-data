Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0; `x` is the first character of `string`. If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`. `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is not less than `count`; `j` is 0; `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` remains 0. If `count2` equals `count`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is not equal to `count`, `done` is `True` if `count2 > count`, otherwise `done` retains its value based on the comparison of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`.**
