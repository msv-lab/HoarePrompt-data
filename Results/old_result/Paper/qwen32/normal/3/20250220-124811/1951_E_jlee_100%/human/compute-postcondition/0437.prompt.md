Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `done` is False; `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed); `i` is 1; and `done` remains False. If the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`, the condition `x != s[-1]` holds true. Additionally, if `s.count(x) == n`, then all characters in `s` are equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, then `n` is odd and the middle character `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is either 0 or greater than 0; `j` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is compared to `count`, and `done` is set to True if `count2 < count`. If `count2 == count`, `count2` remains equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0, and `done` is True if `count > 1`, otherwise `done` remains False unless `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case `done` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is set to 1, and `done` remains False unless `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x != s[-1]`, the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`. If `s.count(x) == n`, all characters in `s` are equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, `n` is odd and the middle character `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`. If `count` is 0, the conditions regarding `count2` and `done` are not updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0, the following conditions apply: If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count2` and `done` remain unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 0, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 2. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then no changes are made to `count`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is less than `count`, `count` is either unchanged or set to 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1; `done` is True and the loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done` or `count`. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count` or `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
