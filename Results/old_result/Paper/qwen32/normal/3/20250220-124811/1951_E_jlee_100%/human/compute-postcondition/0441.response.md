Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; string is the new value of the input; s is a list of characters from the new string; n is the length of the new string; x is the first character of the new string; count is either 0 or greater than 0; count2 is either 0 or greater than 0; j is n; i is 1; the condition (not done) is true, indicating that the program has entered the if statement.**

Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the if part, with the additional information that the condition `not done` is true, meaning the program has entered the if statement.
