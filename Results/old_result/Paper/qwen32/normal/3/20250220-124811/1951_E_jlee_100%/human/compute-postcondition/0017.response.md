Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`. The count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, meaning every character in `s` is `x`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, then `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
