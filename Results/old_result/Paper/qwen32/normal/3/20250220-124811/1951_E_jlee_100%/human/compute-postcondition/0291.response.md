Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 2; `i` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `count2` is less than `count`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged. If `count2` equals `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, then the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 2.**
