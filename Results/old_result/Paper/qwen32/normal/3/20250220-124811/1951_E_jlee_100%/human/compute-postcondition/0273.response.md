Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is 2.
- `i` is 0.
- There is a conditional statement that modifies `count` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. However, `count`, `count2`, and `done` are not defined in the initial state, so this part of the code does not affect the output.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The value of `'YES'` is explicitly given and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
