The value of `n` is assigned the length of the list `s`, which contains the characters from `string`. The length of `s` is equal to the number of characters in `string`. Therefore, `n` is the length of `string`. The values of `t`, `string`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`.**
