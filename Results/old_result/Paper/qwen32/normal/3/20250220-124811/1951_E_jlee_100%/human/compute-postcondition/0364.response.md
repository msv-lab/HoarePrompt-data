Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is greater than 0; `j` is 0. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x` for the current value of `j`. If `count2 < count`, then `done` is True. If `count2 == count`, then `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0, and `done` is True if `count > 1`, otherwise `done` remains False unless `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case `done` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x != s[-1]`, the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`. If `s.count(x) == n`, all characters in `s` are equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, `n` is odd and the middle character `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`.**
