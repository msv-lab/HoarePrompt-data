To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State and Conditions
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `string` is the value of the input.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `string`.
5. `x` is the first character of `string`.
6. `j` is initialized to 1.
7. `i` is initialized to 0.
8. `count` is initialized based on the condition: if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.
9. `count2` and `done` are not explicitly initialized but are mentioned to change based on certain conditions.
10. The loop or if statement breaks out of if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, and `done` is set to True.
11. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.
12. If `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `done` is True.
13. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` when `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is 1.
14. If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.

### Analysis
The `print('YES')` statement is not conditional and will execute regardless of the values of `count`, `count2`, `done`, or any other variable. The initial state and conditions described do not affect the execution of this particular print statement.

### Conclusion
Since the print statement `print('YES')` is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print "YES".

Output: **YES**
