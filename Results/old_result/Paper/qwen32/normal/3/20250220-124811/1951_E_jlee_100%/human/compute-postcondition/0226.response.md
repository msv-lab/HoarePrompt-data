Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is 1.
- `i` is 0.
- If `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `done` is True.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `x` when `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is 1.
- If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(1)
```

**Analysis:**
The provided print statement is `print(1)`. This statement directly prints the integer `1` to the console. It does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

**Output:**
Output: **1**
