Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x` in the new `string`; `count2` is the count of characters equal to `x` after `count` in the new `string`; `done` is False; `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed); `i` is 1; and `done` remains False. If the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`, the condition `x != s[-1]` holds true. Additionally, if `n` is odd and the middle character `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`, the same conditions apply.**
