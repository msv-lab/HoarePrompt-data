Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If all characters in `string` are `x` (i.e., `s.count(x) == n`), the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. Otherwise, if `n` is 1, the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. If `n` is greater than 1 and `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. If `n` is odd and `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the middle character of `string` is not equal to `x` if `done` is False. If `s.count(x) != n - 1`, no changes are made to the variables. `count` is 0 or a value indicating the first non-x character; `count2` is 0 or a value indicating the number of `x` characters after `count`; `done` is False; `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed); `i` is 0. Additionally, if `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, the conditions remain as described. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
