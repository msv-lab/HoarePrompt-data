Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `string` is the input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is not less than `count`.

### Key Points:
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- The character at index `j` (which is `s[0]`) is not equal to `x` (the first character of `string`).
- `string[:j - 1]` and `string[j - 1:]` need to be evaluated.

### Evaluating the Print Statement:
- `string[:j - 1]`:
  - Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1.
  - `string[:-1]` means all characters of `string` except the last one.
  
- `string[j - 1:]`:
  - Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1.
  - `string[-1:]` means the last character of `string`.

### Combining the Results:
- The print statement will output the substring of `string` excluding the last character followed by the last character of `string`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the entire string `string` because `string[:-1]` and `string[-1:]` together form the original string.

### Final Output:
Output: **string**
