Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is not less than `count`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `j`, and `i`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
