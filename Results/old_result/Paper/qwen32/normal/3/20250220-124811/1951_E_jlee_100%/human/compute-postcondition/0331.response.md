Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `j` is 0. `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False. Additionally, if the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`, the condition `x != s[-1]` holds true. If `s.count(x) == n`, then all characters in `s` are equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, then `n` is odd and the middle character `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`.**
