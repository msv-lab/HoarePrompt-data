The provided code snippet initializes two variables `ma` and `mi` to 0. These variables do not depend on any other variables or input values in the initial state, and they are not modified in any way by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0**.
