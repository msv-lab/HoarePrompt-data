Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function calculates the difference between the positions of the first and last 'B' in the string and adds 2 to this difference. This approach does not guarantee finding the minimum continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white. 

For example, consider the input "WBBWBW":
- The first 'B' is at position 2 (1-based index).
- The last 'B' is at position 5 (1-based index).
- The function calculates 5 - 2 + 2 = 5, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 4, as painting the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell will make all cells white.

The correct approach would be to find the length of the longest continuous segment of 'B's in the string, as painting this segment will make all 'B's white. If there are multiple segments of 'B's, the longest one determines the minimum segment length that needs to be painted.

Correctness: **False**
