Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' (ma) and the position of the first 'B' (mi) in the string `s`, plus 2.**
