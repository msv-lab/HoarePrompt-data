The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to the next character in the reversed string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string
- `ma` is `len(s) - 1` if `j` equals 'B', otherwise `ma` remains 0
- `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`
- `m` is an input integer
- `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`
- `d` is 1
- `l` is an empty list
- `j` is the last character of `s`. If `j` equals 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Since `j` is the last character of `s` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `j` should be the second last character of `s`.

Let's denote the string `s` as `s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1]`. If `j` was `s[n-1]` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `j` should be `s[n-2]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is `len(s) - 1` if `j` equals 'B', otherwise `ma` remains 0; `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `m` is an input integer; `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 1; `l` is an empty list; `j` is the second last character of `s`. If `j` equals 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
