The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `l` without affecting any of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list.**
