You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string.

    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `m` is an input integer; `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the string `s` when counting from the start of the string; `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `m` is an input integer; `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is the number of characters from the end of the string to the last 'B'; `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' (ma) and the position of the first 'B' (mi) in the string `s`, plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the length of the substring of `s` that starts at the first occurrence of 'B' and ends at the last occurrence of 'B', inclusive, plus 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white for all cells to become white. The logic in the program is flawed as it only calculates the distance between the first and last black cell and adds 2 to it, which does not necessarily give the minimum segment length required to paint all cells white.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
5
WBWBW
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
Explanation: The minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white is 3 (for example, painting the segment from the 2nd to the 4th cell).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
4
```
Explanation: The program calculates the distance between the first and last black cell (which are at positions 2 and 4) and adds 2, resulting in 4. This is incorrect because a segment of length 3 is sufficient.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is False.
