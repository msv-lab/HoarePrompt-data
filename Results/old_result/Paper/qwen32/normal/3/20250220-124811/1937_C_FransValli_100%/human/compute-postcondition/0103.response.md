The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is currently 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

The other variables (`t`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted according to the task requirements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 2; `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[1]` if `res` is `'<'`, or `[0, i]` if `res` is not equal to `'='`, and `[0, n-1, i]` if `res` is `'='`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is 2; `res` is the user's new input.**
