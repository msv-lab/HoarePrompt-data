Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 2; `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[1]` if `res` is `'<'`, or `[0, i]` if `res` is not equal to `'='`, and `[0, n-1, i]` if `res` is `'='`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is 2; `res` is the user's new input.**

Explanation: The only change is that `res` is updated to the user's new input. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
