### Reasoning:

The program aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries. The program's strategy involves:

1. **Finding the Largest Element (`maxi`)**:
   - The program iterates over each element `i` from `1` to `n-1` and compares `p_maxi | p_maxi` with `p_i | p_i`.
   - If `p_maxi | p_maxi < p_i | p_i`, it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This effectively finds the index of the largest element in the permutation `p` because `p_i | p_i` is maximized when `p_i` is the largest.

2. **Finding the Smallest Element (`mini`)**:
   - The program initializes `arr` with the index `0`.
   - It then iterates over each element `i` from `1` to `n-1` and compares `p_maxi | p_arr[0]` with `p_maxi | p_i`.
   - If `p_maxi | p_arr[0] < p_maxi | p_i`, it updates `arr` to `[i]`.
   - If `p_maxi | p_arr[0] == p_maxi | p_i`, it appends `i` to `arr`.
   - This identifies all indices that could potentially be the smallest element when XORed with `p_maxi`.
   - The program then iterates over the indices in `arr` and compares `p_mini | p_mini` with `p_item | p_item` for each `item` in `arr`.
   - If `p_mini | p_mini > p_item | p_item`, it updates `mini` to `item`.
   - This step finds the index of the smallest element in the permutation `p` that, when XORed with `p_maxi`, results in the maximum possible XOR value.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints `! maxi mini`, which are the indices of the largest and smallest elements in the permutation `p`, respectively.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**: The strategy correctly identifies the largest and smallest elements in the permutation `p` by leveraging the properties of bitwise OR and XOR operations. The largest element will have the highest bits set, and the smallest element will have the lowest bits set, maximizing the XOR when combined.
- **Query Count**: The program uses `2n - 2` queries for each test case (one loop for finding `maxi` and another for finding `mini`), which is well within the `3n` limit.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and adheres to the problem constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
