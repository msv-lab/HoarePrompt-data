Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains at least two elements; `mini` is `item` if `res` equals `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains the first element of `arr`; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's input.**
