The code snippet `mini = arr[0]` assigns the value of the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `arr` contains indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and `mini` is updated to the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the first element of `arr`; `i` is `n-1`.**
