The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the number of times specified by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached.

Since the loop head does not involve any of the variables `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, or `mini`, their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was given; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists**
