Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is a list with at least two elements, `mini` is updated based on the previous `res` and `item`, `item` is the next element in `arr` after the current `item` (i.e., if `item` was `arr[1]`, now `item` is `arr[2]`), `res` is the user's input

```
res = input()
```

The code snippet takes a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is a list with at least two elements, `mini` is updated based on the previous `res` and `item`, `item` is the next element in `arr` after the current `item`, `res` is the new user's input.**
