Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is an input string, `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

In this output state, the variable `arr` has been created and contains the value of `i`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`) retain their initial values and conditions.
