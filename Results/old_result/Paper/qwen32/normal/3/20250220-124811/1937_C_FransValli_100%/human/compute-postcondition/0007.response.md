The code snippet provided only contains the line `maxi = i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, it's unclear what value `i` holds. Assuming `i` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code and holds a specific value, the value of `maxi` will be updated to that value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the provided code, the only variable that changes is `maxi`. The variable `maxi` is updated to the value of `i`. Since the value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `maxi` will be equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is equal to `i`; `res` is a string equal to the user's input, and `res` equals '<'**.
