The code snippet provided takes an input and assigns it to the variable `res`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `arr`) are not affected by this input operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `res` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[0]`, `res` is an input string**.
