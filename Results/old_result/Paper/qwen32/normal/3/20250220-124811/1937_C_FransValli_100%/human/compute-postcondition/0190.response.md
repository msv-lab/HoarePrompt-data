Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` contains at least two elements, `mini` is equal to `item` if `res` is `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated to the new input string, while all other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
