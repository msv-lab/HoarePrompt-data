The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. The value of `i` is `n-1`, so `n-1` is added to `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the user input; `arr` has `n-1` appended to it.**
