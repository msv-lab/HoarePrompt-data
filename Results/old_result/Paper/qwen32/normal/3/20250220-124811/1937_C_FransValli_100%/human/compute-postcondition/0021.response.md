To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the provided `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the `range(1, n)` will generate at least one value for `i` in that case.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given
- `arr` is `[0]`

The only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`. However, `i` is the loop variable and is automatically initialized by the `for` loop. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `n` is not specified, so we need to ensure it meets this condition.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[0]`**
