The code snippet initializes a list `arr` with the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is 1, `res` is the user input, `arr` is [1]**.
