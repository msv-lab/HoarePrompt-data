Let's break down the variables and their values based on the given initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3. However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement.
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given. However, `maxi` is not used in the provided print statement.
4. `arr` contains at least two elements.
5. `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
6. `i` is `n-1`. However, `i` is not used in the provided print statement.
7. `item` is not defined in the initial state, which means it must be defined elsewhere in the code. Without additional context, we can only assume that `item` is some value that is relevant to the execution of the program.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

We can deduce the following:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
- `item` is some value that is not specified in the initial state, but it is used twice in the print statement.

Since `mini` is explicitly defined as the first element of `arr`, we can use that value directly. However, `item` remains undefined based on the given information, so we'll describe it as it is.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of arr and [item] is the value of item)**
