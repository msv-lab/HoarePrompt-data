Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `maxi` is 0.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so its value is not known.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The string `'?'` is a literal and will be printed as is.
- `maxi` is explicitly defined as 0, so it will be printed as 0.
- `maxi` is printed twice, so 0 will be printed twice.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`, but we can represent it as `i` in the output.

### Output:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
