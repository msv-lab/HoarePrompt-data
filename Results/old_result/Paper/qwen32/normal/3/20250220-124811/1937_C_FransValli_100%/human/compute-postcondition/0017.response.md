The value of `maxi` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `res` is the user's new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `res` is the user's new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `maxi` is `i + 1`.**
