After the loop has executed all its iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the final state of the variables can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` remains unchanged as the input integer.
- `maxi` will be the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given.
- `arr` will contain all the values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and it will also contain the largest `i` for which the user's input was `'<'` if such an `i` exists (i.e., `maxi` will be the last element of `arr` if `maxi` is not `0`).

The final state of `arr` is determined by the sequence of inputs (`'<'` or `'='`) received during each iteration of the loop. If the input was `'<'` for some `i`, then `arr` will be `[i]` at the end of the loop. If the input was `'='` for multiple `i` values, then `arr` will include all those `i` values in the order they were received.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not `0`, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element.**
