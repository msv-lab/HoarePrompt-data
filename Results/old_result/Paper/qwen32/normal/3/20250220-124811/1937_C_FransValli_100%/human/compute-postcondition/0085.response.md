The code snippet `arr = [0]` reassigns the list `arr` to a new list containing only the integer `0`. This means the previous contents of `arr` are discarded, and `arr` now contains only one element, which is `0`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[0]`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is `n-1`.**
