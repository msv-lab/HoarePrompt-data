The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder for loop variables when the variable itself is not used within the loop body. The number of iterations of the loop is determined by the input provided to `int(input())`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the state of `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop body and does not influence the loop's continuation. The loop will execute as many times as the integer provided by the user input.

Since the loop head does not contain any variables that need to be adjusted based on the loop's internal state, we only need to ensure that the input to the loop (the number of iterations) is correctly represented.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`**
