The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `res`. This means `res` will hold the value entered by the user as a string. The values of `t`, `n`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is 0; `res` is a string equal to the user's input.**
