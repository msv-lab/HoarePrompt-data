The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. Therefore, `maxi` will now hold the value of `i`, which is `k + 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `arr`, and `mini`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new user's input, `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element, `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `i` is `k + 2`, `maxi` is `k + 2`.**
