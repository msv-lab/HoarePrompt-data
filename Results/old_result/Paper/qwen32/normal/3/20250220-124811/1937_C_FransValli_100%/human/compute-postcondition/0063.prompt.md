Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not `0`, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element; `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is a list with at least two elements. If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` is set to `item`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is a list with at least two elements. If `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is equal to `item`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr`. `item` is the next element in `arr` after the current `item`. `res` is the user's input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is a list with at least two elements. If `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is set to `item` and `item` is updated to the next element in `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` and `item` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
