The code snippet `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to the variable `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` contains at least two elements, `mini` is equal to `item`, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the new input string.**
