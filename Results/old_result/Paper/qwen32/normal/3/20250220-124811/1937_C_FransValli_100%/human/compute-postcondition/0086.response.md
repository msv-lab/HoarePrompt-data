To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is already set to `n-1` before the loop starts, but this value will be overwritten by the loop initialization. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop initializes `i` to 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Adjustments**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables (`t`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, and the initial value of `i`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[0]`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is `n-1`.**
