Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input. If `n` equals 1, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is set to the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of `n` minus 1, unless `power` equals `n`, in which case `power` remains `n`.**
