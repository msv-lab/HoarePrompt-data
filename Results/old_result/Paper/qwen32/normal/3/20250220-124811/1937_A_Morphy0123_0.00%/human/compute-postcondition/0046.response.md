Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` must be greater than 4; `power` is 3.**

Natural language: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
