Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` must be greater than 2; `power` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
