The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop. The variable `n` and `power` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n_cases` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n_cases`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1 from its previous value. The value of `n_cases` remains the same.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 1 for this iteration**.
