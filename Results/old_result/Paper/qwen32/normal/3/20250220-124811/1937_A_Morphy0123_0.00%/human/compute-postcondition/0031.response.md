To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and how it evolves with each iteration.

The loop increments `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. The `log2(n)` function returns the base-2 logarithm of `n`, which is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to get `n`. Therefore, `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `power` becomes 2, meaning `n` must be greater than 2 but not greater than 4.
- After 2 iterations, `power` becomes 3, meaning `n` must be greater than 4 but not greater than 8.
- After 3 iterations, `power` becomes 4, meaning `n` must be greater than 8 but not greater than 16.

From this pattern, it is clear that after `k` iterations, `power` will be `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than \(2^k\) but not greater than \(2^{k+1}\).

The loop will terminate when `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, which can be expressed as `ceil(log2(n))`.

Thus, the final state of `power` will be `ceil(log2(n))`. The other variables (`n_cases` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `power` is ceil(log2(n)).**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, `power` will be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged.
