To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \leq \text{n\_cases} \leq 10^4\). However, this variable is not used in the given code snippet.
- `i` is not yet initialized. Since `i` is not used in the given code snippet, we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `power` is described as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). However, the problem states that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n` in the initial state.
- Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** n`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the given integer greater than 1.

### Output:
Output: **2 ** n (where n is an integer greater than 1)**
