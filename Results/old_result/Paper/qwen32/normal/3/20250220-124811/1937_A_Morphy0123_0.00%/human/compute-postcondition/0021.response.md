The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`. Since `i` is not yet initialized at the beginning of the first iteration, it will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts. The variable `n_cases` remains unchanged throughout the iterations as it represents the total number of iterations the loop will perform.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been some value between 0 and `n_cases - 1`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The variable `n_cases` does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, the program does not modify any variables. Otherwise, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `power` is the largest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) is greater than or equal to `n`. If `power` was originally equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.**

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the state of `n` and `power` remains as described in the problem statement and does not need to be modified here.

If we assume the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`. For the first iteration, `i` will be initialized to 0.

Thus, the most general statement without knowing the exact previous value of `i` would be:
State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` and `power` remain unchanged as per their descriptions.**
