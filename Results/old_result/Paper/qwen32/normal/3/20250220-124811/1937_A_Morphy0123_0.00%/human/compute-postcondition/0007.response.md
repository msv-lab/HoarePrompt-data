To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the variables in the loop condition, which are `power` and `log2(n)`. The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. Given the initial state, `power` is set to 1, and `n` is an integer that is not equal to 1.

Let's break down the requirements:
1. `power` is initialized to 1.
2. `n` is an integer not equal to 1, which means `log2(n)` will be a positive value (since `log2(1) = 0` and `n` is not 1).

For the loop to execute, `power` (which is 1) must be less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1. This implies that `n` must be greater than 2 because `log2(2) = 1` and `n` must be strictly greater than 2 for `log2(n)` to be greater than 1.

Since `i` is not yet initialized and it is not part of the loop condition, we do not need to adjust it. The variable `n_cases` is also not part of the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted either.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `power` is 1**
