Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power is greater than or equal to n, and the current value of `power` is equal to `n`.**
