Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input. The values of `n_cases` and the fact that `i` is not yet initialized remain unchanged.
