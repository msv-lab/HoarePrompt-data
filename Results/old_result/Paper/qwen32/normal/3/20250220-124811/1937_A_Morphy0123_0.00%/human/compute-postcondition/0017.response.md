Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) is greater than or equal to `n`; `power` is not equal to `n` and has been decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `power` has been reduced by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
