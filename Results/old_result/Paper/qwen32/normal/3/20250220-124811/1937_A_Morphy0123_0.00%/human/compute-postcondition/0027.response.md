To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition. The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. The variables involved here are `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `power` is currently 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true. Since `power` is 2, we need `log2(n)` to be greater than 2. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^2\), or in other words, `n` must be greater than 4.

No other variables (`n_cases` or `i`) are involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 4.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` must be greater than 4; `power` is 2.**
