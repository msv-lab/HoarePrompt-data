To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`.

The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. For the loop to execute again, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

Given:
- `power` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 4.

First, let's consider the value of `log2(n)`. Since `n` is greater than 4, `log2(n)` is greater than `log2(4)`, which is 2. However, to ensure that the loop can execute again, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`, which is 3.

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2^3, which is 8. This ensures that `log2(n)` is greater than 3, allowing the condition `power < log2(n)` to be true.

State: **`power` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 8**
