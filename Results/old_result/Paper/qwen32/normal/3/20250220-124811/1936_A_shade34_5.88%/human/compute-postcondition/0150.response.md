The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be at least 2 for the loop to run even once.

The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it is initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` remains the initial value, `pans` remains the initial value, `n` must be greater than 1**
