To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans` in this case.

The for loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means the loop will iterate over the indices of `pans` starting from 1 up to, but not including, the length of `pans`. For the loop to execute at least once, `pans` must have at least 2 elements. If `pans` has fewer than 2 elements, the range `(1, len(pans))` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Here are the necessary adjustments:
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so no specific adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts, as it will be set to 1 by the `range` function.

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` remains the initial value, `pans` contains at least 2 elements**
