Postcondition: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `pans` is `[i]` if the current `s` is '<', otherwise `pans` is either unchanged or has the new `i` appended to it if `s` is not '='. `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` remains unchanged from its state before the if statement.**
