Postcondition: **`mak` is 4 if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value 4 if `s` is `'<'`, the value `i` if `s` is `'='`, or an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the new string input provided by the user. `i` is 4.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block is executed, considering all possible cases for the input `s`.
