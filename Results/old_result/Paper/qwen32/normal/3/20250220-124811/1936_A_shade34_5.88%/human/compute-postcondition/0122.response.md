The code snippet `pans = [i]` updates the value of `pans` to be a list containing the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
