The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`. To execute one more iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `mak` is the value of `i` if the input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` remains the initial value.
- `pans` contains at least `i + 1` elements.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`mak` is the value of `i` if the input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0; `mak2` remains the initial value; `pans` contains at least `i + 2` elements; `i` is `i + 1`.**
