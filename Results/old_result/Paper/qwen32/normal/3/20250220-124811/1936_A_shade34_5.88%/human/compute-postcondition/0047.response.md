The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is 5, `mak` will now hold the value 5. The other variables (`s`, `pans`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is 5, `pans` is `[4]` if `s` was initially '<', includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents if `s` was initially '=', otherwise no changes are made to `pans`, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.**
