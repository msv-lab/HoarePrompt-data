To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change based on the inputs.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, the program prints a query and reads a response. If the response is `'<'`, the variable `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`.

**Final Output State Analysis:**
- The loop iterates `n-1` times.
- `mak` will hold the largest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`.
- If no input was `'<'` during any iteration, `mak` will remain 0.

Given that `t` and `n` are not modified within the loop, their values will remain as they were initially. The variable `mak` will be the last `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, and `mak` is the largest value of `i` (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

In simpler terms, `mak` will be the highest index `i` where the input was `'<'`, or 0 if there was no such index.
