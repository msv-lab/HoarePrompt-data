Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code attempts to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using the allowed queries. However, there are issues with the logic and the approach taken in the code.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Query Strategy**: The code's strategy for querying is not optimal and does not guarantee that it will find the indices with the maximum XOR value within the allowed number of queries.

2. **Handling of Equal Values**: The code does not handle the scenario where multiple elements have the same OR values effectively. Specifically, it does not ensure that it finds the maximum XOR among these elements.

3. **Incorrect Index Selection**: The code incorrectly selects indices based on the OR comparison, which does not necessarily lead to the indices with the maximum XOR.

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider a permutation where the maximum XOR value is achieved by a pair of elements that are not identified by the current strategy. For example, let's take a permutation \( p = [0, 3, 1, 2] \) for \( n = 4 \).

- The maximum XOR value is achieved by \( p_3 \oplus p_2 = 2 \oplus 1 = 3 \).
- The code might incorrectly identify \( p_0 \) and \( p_1 \) as the pair with the maximum XOR value due to the way it handles OR comparisons.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve a more systematic way to explore the permutation using the allowed queries. One possible strategy is to use a divide-and-conquer approach or a greedy strategy that ensures all potential pairs are considered within the allowed number of queries.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided code and the potential for it to fail in certain cases, the correctness of the program is **False**.
