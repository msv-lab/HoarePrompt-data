The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pans`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`) are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `mak2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `mak` is the largest value of `i` (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.**
