The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`mak` is `i`; `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received; `pans` contains at least two elements; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**
