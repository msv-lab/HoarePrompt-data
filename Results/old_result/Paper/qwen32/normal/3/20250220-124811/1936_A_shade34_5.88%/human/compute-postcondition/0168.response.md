The code snippet `pans = []` reassigns the variable `pans` to an empty list. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `n` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is an empty list; `n` remains unchanged.**
