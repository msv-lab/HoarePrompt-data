Postcondition: **`sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, `s` is the string input by the user, `mak` is equal to `i` if `s` was initially '=', otherwise `mak` remains unchanged, `pans` includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents if `s` was initially '=', otherwise no changes are made to `pans`, `i` is 4, and `n` remains unchanged.**
