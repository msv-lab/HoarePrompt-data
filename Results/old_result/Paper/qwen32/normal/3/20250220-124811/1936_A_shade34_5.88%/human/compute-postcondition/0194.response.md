Output State: **`mak` is 5, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value 4 if `s` is `'<'`, the value `i` if `s` is `'='`, or an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new string input provided by the user; `i` is 5.**

In natural language: The value of `mak` has been updated to 5. The values of `mak2`, `pans`, `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `mak`.
