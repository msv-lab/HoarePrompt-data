The code snippet `pans = [i]` changes the value of `pans` to a list containing the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is 5, `pans` will now be `[5]`.

The other variables (`s`, `mak`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `s` is a new string input by the user, `mak` is 5, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 5. Since `pans` is explicitly reassigned, its previous value (which could have been `[4]` if `s` was initially '<', or could have included the value of `i` if `s` was initially '=', or could have remained unchanged otherwise) is replaced by `[5]`.

Output State: **`s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is 5, `pans` is `[5]`, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.**
