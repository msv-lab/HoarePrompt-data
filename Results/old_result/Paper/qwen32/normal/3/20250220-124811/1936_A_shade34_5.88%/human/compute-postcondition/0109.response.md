Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **mak**: This variable holds the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'.
2. **mak2**: This variable also holds the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. It seems redundant as it is set to the same value as `mak`.
3. **pans**: This is a list that contains `[i]` if `s` (the input string) is equal to '<'. Otherwise, it is an empty list.
4. **n**: This is an integer that is greater than 0.
5. **s**: This is the input string.
6. **i**: This variable is incremented by 1 in the context of the problem, but its exact value is not provided.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Determining Values:
- **'?'**: This is a literal string, so it will be printed as '?'.
- **mak**: This variable holds the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. Since the exact value of `mak` is not provided, we will denote it as `mak`.
- **mak2**: This variable is the same as `mak`, so it will also be denoted as `mak`.
- **i**: This variable is incremented by 1, but without knowing its initial value, we will denote it as `i`.
- **mak2**: This variable is the same as `mak`, so it will also be denoted as `mak`.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak] (where [mak] is the maximum value of i for which the input was '<' and [i] is the current value of i after incrementing by 1)**
