The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, after the execution of the code, `mak` will also hold the value `i + 1`. The other variables (`mak2`, `pans`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid.

Output State: **`mak` is `i + 1`; `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
