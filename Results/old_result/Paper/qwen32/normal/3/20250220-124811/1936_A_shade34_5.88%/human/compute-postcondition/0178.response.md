Output State: **`mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input provided by the user, and `s` is equal to `'='`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
