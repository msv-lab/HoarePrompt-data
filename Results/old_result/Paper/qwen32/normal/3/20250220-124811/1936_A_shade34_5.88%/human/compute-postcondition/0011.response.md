The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which does not change the values of any variables or affect the program state in terms of variable values. It simply flushes the output buffer. Thus, the only change in the state is the increment of the variable `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the value of `i` if the current input is the string `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
