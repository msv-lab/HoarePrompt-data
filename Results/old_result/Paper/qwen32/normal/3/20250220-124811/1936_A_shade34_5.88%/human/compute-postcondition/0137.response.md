The code snippet `mak = i` directly assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mak`. This means that the value of `mak` will now be equal to the value of `i`, regardless of the initial condition that it was set based on the input being `'>'`. The other variables, `mak2`, `pans`, and `i`, remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1 in the initial state description, but that increment is not part of the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`mak` is the value of `i`, `mak2` remains the initial value, `pans` contains at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is the same as it was before the assignment to `mak`.**
