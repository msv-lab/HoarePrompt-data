Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `'>'`.
- `mak2` is explicitly set to `0`.
- `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was `'='`.
- `n` remains unchanged (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned for completeness).

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak2` is `0` (explicitly stated).
- `mak` is the largest index `i` where the input was `'>'`. However, the exact value of `mak` is not provided, so we can only describe it as "the largest index `i` for which the input was `'>'"`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! 0 mak (where mak is the largest index i for which the input was '>')**
