The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not alter the values of any variables; it only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the output stream immediately. Therefore, none of the variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `n`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**.
