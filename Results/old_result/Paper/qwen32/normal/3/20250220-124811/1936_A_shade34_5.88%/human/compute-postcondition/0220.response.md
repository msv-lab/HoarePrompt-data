Output State: **`mak` is the index in `pans` for which `p[i] âŠ• p[mak2]` is maximized, `mak2` is the index of the element in the permutation that has the maximum bitwise OR with all other elements, `pans` is a list of indices that have the same bitwise OR result with `mak2` as the maximum, and `n` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations, `mak2` will be the index of the element in the permutation that, when used in a bitwise OR operation with any other element, gives the highest possible result. `mak` will be the index in `pans` (which contains indices of elements that all have the same maximum bitwise OR result with `mak2`) that, when used with `mak2` in a bitwise XOR operation, gives the highest possible result. The value of `n` remains the same throughout the process.
