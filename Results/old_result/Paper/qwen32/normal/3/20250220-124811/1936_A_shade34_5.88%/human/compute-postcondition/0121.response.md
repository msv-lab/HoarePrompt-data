Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if the previous `s` was equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `mak` is now equal to `i`. The value of `mak2` remains unchanged as the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. The list `pans` is updated to `[i]` if the previous input string `s` was '<', otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 0. The input string `s` is still the new input string. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
