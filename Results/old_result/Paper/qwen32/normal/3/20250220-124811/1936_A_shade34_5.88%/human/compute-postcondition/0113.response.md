The code snippet `pans = [i]` changes the value of `pans` to a new list containing the current value of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
