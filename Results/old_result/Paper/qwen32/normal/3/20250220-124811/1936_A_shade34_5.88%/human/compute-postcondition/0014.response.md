The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Given that `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `n`.

The variable `mak` is not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it. However, for completeness, we note that if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` would be set to the value of `i` after the increment; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
