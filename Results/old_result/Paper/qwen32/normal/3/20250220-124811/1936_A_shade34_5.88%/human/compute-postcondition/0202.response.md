Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `mak` is 0.
2. `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received.
3. `pans` contains at least two elements.
4. `n` remains unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `mak2` is defined based on the last index `i` where the input was '<'. However, `mak2` is not used in the print statement.
- `pans` contains at least two elements, but the exact elements are not specified.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `i` is used in the print statement, we need to consider the context in which `i` is defined. However, based on the information given, `i` is not explicitly provided, and we can assume it might be a variable used in some previous part of the code, but it's not defined here.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the problem statement asks for the most precise description possible based on the given information. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

### Output Analysis:
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]` because `mak` is 0.
- `pans[i]` depends on the value of `i`, which is not provided. However, we know that `pans` contains at least two elements, so `i` could be 0, 1, or any valid index in the list.

Given the information, the output will be:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
- `pans[mak]` is again `pans[0]`.
- `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]` is again the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[i] is the element at index i in the pans list)**
