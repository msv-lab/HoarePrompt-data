Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `c` is 0 or the initial value minus the number of times `cntl[j] < 2` was true, and `j` is the final value when the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` is 0 if the loop terminated because `c` reached 0, or it is the value after the last decrement if the loop terminated because `j` reached `n`, and `j` is the value at which the loop terminated (either the value that made `c` 0 or `n`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is incremented by the number of times 0 appears in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is equal to 0, the program does not enter the else block. Otherwise, the loop will print the first `j` (from 1 to `n`) for which `c` becomes 0, or it will print `n` if `c` never reaches 0 during the iterations. `c` and `j` remain unchanged unless modified within the else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
