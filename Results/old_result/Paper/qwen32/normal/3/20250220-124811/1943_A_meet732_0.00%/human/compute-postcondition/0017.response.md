Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**

In natural language: The value of `c` is decreased by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state, except that `c` is now one less than its previous value.
