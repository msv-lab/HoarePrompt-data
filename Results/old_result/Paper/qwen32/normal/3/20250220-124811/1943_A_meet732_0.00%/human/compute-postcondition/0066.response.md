The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`. So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the last iteration.

Given that `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the last iteration, it means that at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next integer value.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is `j + 2`**
