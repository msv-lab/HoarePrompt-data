Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is incremented by the number of times 0 appears in `a`. If `cntl[0]` is equal to 0, the program does not enter the else block. Otherwise, the loop will print the first `j` (from 1 to `n`) for which `c` becomes 0, or it will print `n` if `c` never reaches 0 during the iterations. `c` and `j` remain unchanged unless modified within the else block.**
