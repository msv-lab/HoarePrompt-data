Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is incremented by the number of times 0 appears in `a`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged.**
