### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The strategy revolves around the frequency of numbers in the array `a`.

1. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - The program initializes a count list `cntl` of size `n+1` to count the frequency of each number in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and updates the count list `cntl`.

2. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If the number `0` does not appear in the array `a` (i.e., `cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`.
   - If `0` appears, the program calculates `c` as the minimum of `2` and the frequency of `0` in `a` (`cntl[0]`). This value `c` indicates how many `0`s Alice can place in `c` before Bob can prevent her from placing more.
   - The program then iterates through the numbers starting from `1` to `n` and checks their frequencies in `a`. If a number `j` appears less than `2` times, it means Bob can prevent Alice from placing more of that number in `c` by taking it in his turn. The program decrements `c` each time it finds such a number.
   - When `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end, the current number `j` is the MEX of `c`.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she tries to place as many `0`s as possible and then the next smallest numbers.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he tries to prevent Alice from placing numbers in `c` by taking them in his turn.
   - The logic of decrementing `c` and checking frequencies ensures that the program correctly identifies the smallest number that cannot be placed in `c` after both players play optimally.

### Correctness:

Given the logic and the steps described above, the program correctly determines the final score of the game based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The execution summary indicates that the function processes each test case by counting frequencies and determining the MEX, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
