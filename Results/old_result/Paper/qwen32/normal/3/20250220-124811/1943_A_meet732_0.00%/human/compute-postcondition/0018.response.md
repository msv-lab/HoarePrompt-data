Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`.**
