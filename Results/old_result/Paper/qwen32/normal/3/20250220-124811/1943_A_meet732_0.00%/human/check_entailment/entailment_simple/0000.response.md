### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `a`. This is done using the line `cntl[i] += 1` for each element `i` in `a`.

2. **Handling MEX Calculation**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is `0`, it means `0` is not present in the array, and thus the MEX is `0`. This is handled by the condition `if cntl[0] == 0: print(0)`.
   - If `cntl[0]` is not `0`, the program initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This value `c` is used to keep track of how many more elements can be added to `c` before the MEX changes.
   - The program then iterates over the range from `1` to `n` (inclusive). For each number `j`, if `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, it means that number can be added to `c` without affecting the MEX more than necessary. The program decrements `c` in this case.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, the current `j` is the MEX, and the program prints it.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the counting of elements and the logic for determining the MEX based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Here are a few points to consider:

- The program correctly identifies the MEX when `0` is not in the array.
- It correctly updates the count of elements and determines the MEX based on the number of occurrences and the turns of the players.
- The logic for decrementing `c` and checking when to print the MEX is sound.

Given the provided example cases and the logic in the program, the program seems to be correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
