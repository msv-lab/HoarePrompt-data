The code snippet `c -= 1` decreases the value of `c` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `j`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `j` is `j + 1`. `c` is decreased by 1.**
