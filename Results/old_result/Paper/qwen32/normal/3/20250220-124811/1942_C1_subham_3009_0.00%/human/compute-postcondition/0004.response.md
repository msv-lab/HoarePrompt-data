The code snippet provided reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then mapped to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` and `x` have specific constraints, and `y` is initially 0. After executing the code, `n`, `x`, and `y` will be updated with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer read from input.**
