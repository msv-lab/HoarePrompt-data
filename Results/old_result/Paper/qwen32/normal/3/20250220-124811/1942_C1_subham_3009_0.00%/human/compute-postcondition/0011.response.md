The code snippet `arr = input().split()` reads a new line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This new list replaces the previous value of `arr`, which was a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of strings read from the new input.**
