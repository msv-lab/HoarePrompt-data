To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` has been decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not provided.
   - `n` is the first integer read from the new input.
   - `x` is the second integer read from the new input.
   - `y` is the third integer read from the new input.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x - 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only uses the variable `x`. 
   - `x` is described as the second integer read from the new input.
   - The print statement calculates `x - 2` and prints the result.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

**Output Description:**
The code prints the value of `x` minus 2, where `x` is the second integer read from the new input.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer read from the new input)**
