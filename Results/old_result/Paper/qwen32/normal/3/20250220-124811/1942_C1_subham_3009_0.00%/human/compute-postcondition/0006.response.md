The code snippet provided converts each element in the list `arr` from a substring to an integer. This means that each element in `arr` is now an integer instead of a substring.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer read from input; `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 0 and 10^4; `n` remains the same integer read from input between 4 and 10^9; `x` remains the same integer read from input between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 · 10^5; `y` remains the same integer read from input; and `arr` is now a list of integers instead of substrings.
