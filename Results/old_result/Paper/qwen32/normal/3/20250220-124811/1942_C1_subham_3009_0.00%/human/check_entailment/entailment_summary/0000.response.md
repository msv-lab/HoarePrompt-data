### Reasoning:

The provided program consistently outputs `x - 2` for each test case. According to the problem statement, we are to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given `x` vertices and no additional vertices (`y = 0`).

When `y = 0`, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is determined solely by the `x` vertices Bessie has already chosen. The formula to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from `x` vertices on a polygon is `x - 2`. This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles you can form from `x` vertices on a polygon is `x - 2`.

For example:
- If `x = 4`, you can form 2 triangles (since `4 - 2 = 2`).
- If `x = 8`, you can form 6 triangles (since `8 - 2 = 6`).
- If `x = 2`, you can form 0 triangles (since `2 - 2 = 0`), but since the problem specifies `x >= 2`, this case is not relevant.

Given this understanding, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case by outputting `x - 2`.
