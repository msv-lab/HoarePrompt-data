Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. The program simply returns `x - 2` for each test case, which does not account for the actual geometry of the problem or the arrangement of the vertices.

Let's analyze why this is incorrect:

1. **Logic Error**: The program does not consider the actual arrangement of vertices and the possibility of forming triangles. It assumes that the maximum number of triangles is always `x - 2`, which is not true for all cases.

2. **Edge Cases**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   5 3 0
   1 3 5
   ```
   According to the problem, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with vertices 1, 3, and 5 in a pentagon is 1, not `3 - 2 = 1`. The vertices 1, 3, and 5 form a single triangle.

3. **General Case**: The program does not handle the general case where the vertices can form multiple triangles. For example:
   ```
   8 4 0
   1 2 3 4
   ```
   Here, the vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 can form two non-intersecting triangles: (1, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 4).

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum number of triangles for all possible configurations of vertices. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
