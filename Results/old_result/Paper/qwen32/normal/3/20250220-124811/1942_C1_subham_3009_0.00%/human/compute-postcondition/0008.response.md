The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer read from input such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer read from input; `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
