Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If the program is run as the main module, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are undefined or out of scope. Otherwise, none of the variables are modified.**

Since the provided program fragment is an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block with no code inside either the if or else parts, the overall postcondition reflects that the variables retain their initial values unless the program is run as the main module, in which case the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` become undefined or out of scope.
