The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state mentions that `n`, `x`, and `y` are already defined, but the code snippet redefines them based on the new input. The variable `t` and the list `arr` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an integer read from input such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an integer read from input
- `arr` is a list of integers read from input

After the code snippet executes:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are reassigned to the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
