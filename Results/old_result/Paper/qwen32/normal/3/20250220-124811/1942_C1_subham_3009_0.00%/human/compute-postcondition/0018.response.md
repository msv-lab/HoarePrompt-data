The code snippet converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers. This means the first `x` elements of `arr` are now integers, while the rest of the elements remain unchanged. The variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are strings.**
