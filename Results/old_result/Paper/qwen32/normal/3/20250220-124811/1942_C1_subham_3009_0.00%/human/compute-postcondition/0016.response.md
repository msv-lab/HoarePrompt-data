The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is at least 0, and `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input. However, the code snippet does not affect `t` or `arr`, and it reassigns `n`, `x`, and `y` with new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is the first integer read from the new input; `x` is the second integer read from the new input; `y` is the third integer read from the new input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the first, second, and third integers read from the new input, respectively. The values of `t` and `arr` remain unchanged.
