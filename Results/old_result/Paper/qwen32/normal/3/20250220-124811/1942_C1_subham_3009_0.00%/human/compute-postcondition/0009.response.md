Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer read from input such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer read from input; `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) retain their initial values.
