The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `'Yes'` is explicitly given and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **Yes**
