### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the program step-by-step based on the provided problem description, program code, and annotations.

#### Problem Understanding:
Bob has a rectangle of dimensions `a x b`. He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. The key points are:
- If either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`, checks if either is even, and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
- After processing all test cases, the program terminates.

#### Validation of Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

The program's logic matches this reasoning. The annotations confirm that the program correctly checks the condition and prints the appropriate response for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
