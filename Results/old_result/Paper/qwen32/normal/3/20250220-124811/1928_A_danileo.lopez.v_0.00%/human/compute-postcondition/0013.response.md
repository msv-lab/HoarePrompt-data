The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop actually depends on the variable `t` to determine how many more times it will execute. Since `t` is the number of iterations left, we need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as per the problem statement, and the condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` is evaluated but does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the integers provided in the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.**
