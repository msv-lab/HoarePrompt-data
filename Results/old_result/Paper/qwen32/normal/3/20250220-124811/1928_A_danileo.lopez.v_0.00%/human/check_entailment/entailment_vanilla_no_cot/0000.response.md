Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b`. He makes a cut parallel to one of the sides to form two smaller rectangles. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles, considering that rotations of the same rectangle are considered identical.

For Bob to be able to form a new rectangle:
- If the original rectangle has at least one even side, he can always cut it into two smaller rectangles of integer dimensions and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
- If both sides are odd, he can only cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a x 1` or `1 x b`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions (since the only possible new rectangles would be `1 x a` or `b x 1`, which are considered the same as the original).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle. It then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that Bob can form a new rectangle. If both are odd, it prints "No".

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program correctly implements the analysis above. If at least one of the sides of the rectangle is even, Bob can form a new rectangle. If both sides are odd, he cannot form a new rectangle.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
