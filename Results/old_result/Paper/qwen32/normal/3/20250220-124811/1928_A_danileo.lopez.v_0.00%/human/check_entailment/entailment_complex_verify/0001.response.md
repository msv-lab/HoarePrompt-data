### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight: if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces. This is because cutting along the even dimension results in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle with integer sides. Conversely, if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle results in two smaller rectangles that cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle with integer sides.

Let's break down the logic with a few examples to confirm the reasoning:

1. **Example with even dimension:**
   - **Input:** `2 6`
   - **Cut:** Horizontally into two `2x3` rectangles.
   - **Rearrange:** These can be rearranged into a `3x4` rectangle.
   - **Output:** `Yes`

2. **Example with both odd dimensions:**
   - **Input:** `3 5`
   - **Cut:** Horizontally into `3x2` and `3x3` or vertically into `1x5` and `2x5`.
   - **Rearrange:** These cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle with integer sides.
   - **Output:** `No`

The annotated code correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
- If the condition is true, it prints `Yes`; otherwise, it prints `No`.

This logic aligns perfectly with the reasoning provided in the original assessment. Therefore, the program is indeed correct.

### Final: **True**
