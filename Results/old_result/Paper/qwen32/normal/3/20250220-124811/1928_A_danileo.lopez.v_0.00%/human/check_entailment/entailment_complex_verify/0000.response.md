Let's analyze the problem and the provided program systematically.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he wants to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
1. The new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original rectangle.
2. Rotations of the same rectangle (e.g., \(4 \times 3\) and \(3 \times 4\)) are considered the same.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If at least one dimension is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Annotations
The annotations state that the program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. For each test case, it checks if at least one of the dimensions is even and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is correct and provides a detailed explanation:
1. If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\). These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a/2 \times 2b\).
2. If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\). These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times b/2\).
3. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither of the resulting smaller rectangles from any cut can be combined to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Verification
Let's verify the correctness of these points:
1. **Even \(a\) or \(b\)**:
   - If \(a\) is even, cutting it into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles and combining them to form a \(a/2 \times 2b\) rectangle is valid.
   - If \(b\) is even, cutting it into two \(a \times b/2\) rectangles and combining them to form a \(2a \times b/2\) rectangle is valid.
   - Both cases produce a new rectangle with different dimensions.

2. **Odd \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions. These smaller rectangles cannot be combined to form a new rectangle with different dimensions because combining two odd-sized rectangles will always result in a rectangle with at least one odd dimension, which is the same as the original dimensions.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The logic in the program accurately determines whether Bob can form another rectangle based on the dimensions being even or odd. The annotations and the reasoning provided in the original assessment align with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
