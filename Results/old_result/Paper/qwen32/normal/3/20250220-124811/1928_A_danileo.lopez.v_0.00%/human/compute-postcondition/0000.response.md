Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `a` and `b` are two integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle; there are `t` such test cases.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. The variables `a` and `b` still represent the dimensions of Bob's rectangle and retain their initial conditions.
