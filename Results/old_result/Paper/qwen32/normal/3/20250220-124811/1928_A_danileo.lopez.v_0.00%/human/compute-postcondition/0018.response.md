Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, the program has read two integers `a` and `b`, and printed 'Yes' if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, or 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after the loop completes; only the outputs ('Yes' or 'No') for each test case are produced.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases, printing 'Yes' if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both are odd. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` will not hold any specific values after the loop finishes, as they are only used during each iteration.
