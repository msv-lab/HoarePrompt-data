The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes `t` as an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. `a` and `b` are integers provided in the input, with the condition that at least one of them is even or both are odd.
3. The `print` statement is `print('No')`, which directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`, the output will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
