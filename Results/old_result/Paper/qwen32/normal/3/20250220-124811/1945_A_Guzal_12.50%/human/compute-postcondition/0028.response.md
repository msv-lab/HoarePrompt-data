Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 2`; `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3`. If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is incremented by an additional 1.**
