The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means that `a`, `b`, and `c` will now hold the specific integer values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.**
