The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same as it determines the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 2`**.
