Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `k` is 0. Additionally, `b` is not divisible by 3, `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3.**
