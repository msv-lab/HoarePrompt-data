Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the counts of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total count of individuals, adjusted based on specific conditions related to the counts of extroverts and universals. If certain conditions are not met, it prints `-1` for that test case.**
