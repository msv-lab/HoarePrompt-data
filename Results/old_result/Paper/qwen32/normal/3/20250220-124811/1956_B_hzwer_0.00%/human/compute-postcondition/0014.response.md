Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input and contains the integer `j + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with elements updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`, and `j` is `n-1`.**
