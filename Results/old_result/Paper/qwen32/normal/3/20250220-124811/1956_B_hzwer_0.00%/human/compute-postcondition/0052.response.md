Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is `max(dp[2][j], dp[3][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[2][j]`, `dp[3][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[2][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, and `j` has iterated from `n - 1` down to `0`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` table will be fully populated with the maximum number of cards that can be collected for each possible scenario based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The specific value of `dp[1][j]` for each `j` will depend on how many times the card `j + 1` appears in `cards`, and the values will be calculated as described. The variables `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `i` will be `1` as it was initialized.
