Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][n-2]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][n-2], dp[i + 2][n-3] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. `j` is `n-2` in both cases.**
