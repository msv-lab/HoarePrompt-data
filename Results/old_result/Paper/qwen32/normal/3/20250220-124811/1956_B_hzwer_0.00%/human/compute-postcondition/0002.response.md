The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, where each element is initially set to `0`. The variables `n` and `cards` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from the input, representing the number of cards each player receives in the current test case; `cards` is a list of integers read from the input; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to `0`.**
