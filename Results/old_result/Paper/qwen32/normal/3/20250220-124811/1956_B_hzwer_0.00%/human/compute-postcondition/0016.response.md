To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` to `0` in reverse order.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.
- `j` is `n-1` throughout the execution.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `j` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, to start the next iteration, `j` should be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `n-2`.

The other variables (`n`, `cards`, and `dp`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `n-2`**
