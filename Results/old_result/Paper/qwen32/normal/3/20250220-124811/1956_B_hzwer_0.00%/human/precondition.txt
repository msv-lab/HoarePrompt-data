The function `solve()` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. The list `a` contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence `a` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
