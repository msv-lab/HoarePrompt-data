Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach used is incorrect, and the logic for calculating the maximum points is flawed.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The dynamic programming table (`dp`) is initialized and updated in a way that does not correctly reflect the game rules and optimal strategies for both players.
2. The `dp` table is supposed to represent the maximum points that the player can get given a certain state, but the transitions and base cases are not set up correctly.
3. The current implementation doesn't account for the fact that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

A more appropriate approach would involve a strategy that considers the optimal moves for both players and the state of the game at each turn. This might involve a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach or a game theory strategy, such as a minimax algorithm that takes into account the optimal moves of both players.

Here is a more correct approach using a greedy strategy combined with counting the occurrences of each card:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the occurrences of each card in your hand
    from collections import Counter
    card_count = Counter(cards)
    
    # Count the occurrences of each card in total (both hands)
    total_count = Counter()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_count[i] = 2  # Each card appears exactly twice in the deck
    
    # Calculate the number of pairs you have
    your_pairs = sum(1 for count in card_count.values() if count == 2)
    
    # Calculate the number of unique cards you have
    unique_cards = len(card_count)
    
    # Calculate the number of unique cards Nene has
    nene_unique_cards = n - unique_cards
    
    # Calculate the maximum points you can get
    # You can get a point for each pair you have, but Nene will block your pairs if possible
    # So, you can only get points for pairs that Nene doesn't have a matching card for
    max_points = min(your_pairs, nene_unique_cards)
    
    return max_points

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

This approach correctly calculates the maximum points you can get by considering the number of pairs you have and the number of unique cards Nene has. This is a more straightforward and correct solution to the problem.
