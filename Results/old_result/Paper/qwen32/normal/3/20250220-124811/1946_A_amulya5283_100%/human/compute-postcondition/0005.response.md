The code snippet sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `a` is updated to be in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
