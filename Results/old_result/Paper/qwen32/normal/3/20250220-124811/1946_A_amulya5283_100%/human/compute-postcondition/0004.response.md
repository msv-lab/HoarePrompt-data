The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means the variable `a` is updated to hold the list of integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
