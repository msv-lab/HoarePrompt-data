The code calculates the value of `mdx` based on the value of `n`. The expression `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` determines the index `mdx`. 

- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2 + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n // 2`.
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2 + 0 - 1`, which simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even.**
