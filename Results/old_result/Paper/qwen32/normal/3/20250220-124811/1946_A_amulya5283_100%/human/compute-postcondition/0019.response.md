The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state provides the conditions and values for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mdx`, and the variable `i` is stated to be `i + 1`, but since `i` is not used in the provided code snippet, its value remains as `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `mdx` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even; `i` is `i + 1`; `res` is incremented by 1.**
