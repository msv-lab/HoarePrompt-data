The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` starting from index `mdx` to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
