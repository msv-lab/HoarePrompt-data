Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` is greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 1.

The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. 

- If `res` was 2, it becomes 3.
- If `res` was 1, it becomes 2.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is either 2 or 3 depending on the initial value of `res`.**
