Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The initial state mentions `t` is `t - 1`, but there's no initial value for `t` provided. This suggests that `t` is being modified from some previous state, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
2. **`n`**: `n` is an input integer. The exact value is not specified, but it's used to define the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. If `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer.
4. **`res`**: `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` starting from index `mdx` to `n-1`. However, `mdx` is not defined in the initial state, so `res` cannot be directly evaluated from the given information.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement simply outputs the integer `1`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` are defined in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

### Final Output:
The output of the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
