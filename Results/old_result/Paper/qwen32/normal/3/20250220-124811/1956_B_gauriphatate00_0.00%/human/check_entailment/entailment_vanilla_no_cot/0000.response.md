Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - It counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand using `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) in your hand.
   - The function then returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score points when you play a card that has already been placed on the table by Nene, and you can have at most `n // 2` such opportunities since there are `n` cards in total and each player plays `n` turns.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads input data from standard input.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It collects the results for each test case and prints them.

The logic is based on the fact that you can score a point only when you play a card that has already been placed on the table by Nene. Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, she will ensure that you score the minimum possible points. The maximum points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the number of cards (`n // 2`), as explained above.

The program handles multiple test cases efficiently and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
