Initial State: `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `3 + n`; `t` must be greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`

The code snippet provided is:
```
idx += n
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `3 + n + n`; `t` must be greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**

In simpler terms, the Output State is: `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `data` remains the same, `idx` is now `3 + 2n`, `t` remains greater than 1, and `results` remains the same.
