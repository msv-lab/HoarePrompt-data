You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a):
    from collections import Counter
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input data representing multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of cards `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result indicating the distribution of cards to two players such that each player receives `n` cards and the sum of the cards each player receives is as close as possible.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, you and Nene, who each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each card has an integer from `1` to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice. Players take turns placing cards on a table, and a player earns a point if the card they place has already been placed on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve if you play optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **Pairs and Points**: The maximum number of points you can earn is limited by the number of pairs of cards you have, because you can only earn a point when you place a card that has already been placed. If you have `k` pairs, you can earn at most `k` points.

2. **Nene's Optimal Play**: Nene will play in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes yours. However, since you are only interested in the maximum number of points you can earn, you can focus on maximizing the number of pairs you can use to earn points.

3. **Turns and Strategy**: Since there are `2n` turns in total, and each player takes `n` turns, you and Nene will each place `n` cards on the table. If you have `k` pairs, you can place `k` cards that will earn you points, and the remaining `n-k` cards will not earn you points.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:

- **`func_1(n, a)`**: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can earn. It counts the number of pairs in your hand and returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. The reason for returning `min(pairs, n // 2)` is that you can only earn a point for each pair you have, but since there are `n` turns per player, you can only place `n` cards in total. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can earn is limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you get, which is `n // 2`.

- **`func_2()`**: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Verification

The logic in `func_1` is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum number of points you can earn based on the number of pairs in your hand and the constraints of the game. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct, as it reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

### Conclusion

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis above.

Correctness: **True**
