The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable (commonly used in loops where the loop variable is not needed), it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**
