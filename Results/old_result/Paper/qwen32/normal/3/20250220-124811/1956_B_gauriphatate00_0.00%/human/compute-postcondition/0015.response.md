The code snippet updates the list `a` by mapping the integers from `data` starting at index `idx` for `n` elements. This means `a` will now contain the integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2 + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace
- `idx` is `3 + n`
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`

After executing the code snippet, `a` will be updated to contain the integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `3 + n`; `t` must be greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**.

In simple terms, the list `a` is now updated to contain integers from `data` starting at index `idx` for `n` elements, while all other variables remain unchanged.
