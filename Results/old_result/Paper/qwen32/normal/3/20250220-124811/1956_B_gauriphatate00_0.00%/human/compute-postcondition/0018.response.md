The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

Given that `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 so that the loop can continue executing as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `3 + n + n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**
