The code snippet updates the value of `n` by reading the integer value from `data[idx]`. This means `n` is now the integer value located at the index `idx` in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**.

In simpler terms, `n` has been updated to the integer value found at `data[idx]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
