The code snippet updates the list `a` by mapping the elements from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace
- `idx` is `4 + 2 * n`
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`

The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` will change the variable `a` to a new list of integers derived from the slice `data[idx:idx + n]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `4 + 2 * n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

In simpler terms, the variable `a` is now a list of integers converted from the slice of `data` starting at `idx` and ending at `idx + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
