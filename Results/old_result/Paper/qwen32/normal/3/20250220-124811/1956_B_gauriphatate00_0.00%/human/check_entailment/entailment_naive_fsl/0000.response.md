Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Game Setup**: 2n cards, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- **Players**: You and Nene, each receive n cards.
- **Game Rules**: Players take turns placing cards on the table. You score a point if a card with the same number is already on the table.
- **Nene's Strategy**: Always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

### Provided Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a):
    from collections import Counter
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - Uses `Counter` from `collections` to count occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - Counts the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`).
   - Returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This logic assumes that:
     - The maximum number of points you can get is the number of pairs you have.
     - However, Nene's optimal play strategy is not accounted for in this simple logic.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads input for multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result.
   - Prints the results.

### Potential Issues:
- **Nene's Strategy**: The current implementation does not consider Nene's optimal strategy. Nene can play in such a way that she maximizes her score and minimizes yours, which might affect the number of points you can score even if you have pairs.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If you have all unique cards, you should score 0 points.
  - If you have all pairs, the score should depend on Nene's strategy.

### Example to Test:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
- You have cards: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Nene has cards: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- If you and Nene play optimally, you can score 0 points because Nene can always place her cards in such a way that you never get a point.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle Nene's optimal strategy. It assumes that the number of points you can score is simply the number of pairs you have, which is not necessarily true given Nene's optimal play.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The code does not account for Nene's optimal strategy, which can affect the number of points you can score. Therefore, it does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get under all potential cases.
