Output State: **results is a list containing all elements corresponding to the number of iterations, and `result` is each element in the list sequentially.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain all the computed results from each iteration. The loop will print each of these results in the order they were computed, one by one.
