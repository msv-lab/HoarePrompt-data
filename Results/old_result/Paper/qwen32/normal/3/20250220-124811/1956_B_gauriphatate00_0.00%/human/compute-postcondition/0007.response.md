The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` to the integer value of the element at index `idx` in the `data` list. Given that `idx` is 1, `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
