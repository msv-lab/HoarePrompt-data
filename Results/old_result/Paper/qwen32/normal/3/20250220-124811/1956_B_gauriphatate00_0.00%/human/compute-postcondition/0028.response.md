Based on the initial state provided, we know that `results` is a list containing at least two elements, and `result` is the second element in this list. The `print(result)` statement will output the value of the second element in the `results` list.

Since the exact elements of the `results` list are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical or string value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the second element of `results`.

Output: **result (where result is the second element of the results list)**
