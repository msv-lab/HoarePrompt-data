The code snippet `data = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `a` directly, but it introduces a new variable `data` which will hold the input values as a list of strings.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace.**
