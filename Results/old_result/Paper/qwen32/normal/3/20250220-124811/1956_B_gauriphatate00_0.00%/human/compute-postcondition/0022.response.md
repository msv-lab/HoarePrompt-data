The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `4 + 2 * n + n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`.
