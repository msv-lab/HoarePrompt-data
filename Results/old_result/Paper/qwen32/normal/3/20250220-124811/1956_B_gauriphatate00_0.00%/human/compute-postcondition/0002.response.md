The given code snippet only initializes the variable `idx` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is 0**.
