### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve in a card game where you and Nene each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck. You aim to maximize your points by placing cards on the table, earning a point if the card you place has already been placed. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Key Observations

1. **Pairs and Points**: The maximum number of points you can earn is limited by the number of pairs of cards you have. Each pair can potentially earn you one point.
2. **Nene's Optimal Play**: Nene's strategy will not affect the calculation of the maximum points you can earn directly, as the problem asks for your maximum possible points assuming optimal play from both players.
3. **Turns and Strategy**: You have `n` turns, and you can only earn a point for each pair you have. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can earn is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`.

#### Solution Analysis

- **`func_1(n, a)`**: This function calculates the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`) and returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is correct because you can only earn a point for each pair you have, and you have `n` turns, so the maximum number of points you can earn is limited by the number of pairs and the number of turns you get.
- **`func_2()`**: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. The input handling is correct, and it processes each test case appropriately.

#### Annotations

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm the logic of the code:
- **`func_1`**: The program correctly counts the number of pairs and returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- **`func_2`**: The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

#### Verification

The logic in `func_1` is sound, as it correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can earn based on the number of pairs in your hand and the constraints of the game. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct, as it reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

#### Conclusion

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis above. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
