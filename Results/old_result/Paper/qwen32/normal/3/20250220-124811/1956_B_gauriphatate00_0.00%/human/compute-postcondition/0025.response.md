The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which iterates over the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `results` is a list with at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element**
