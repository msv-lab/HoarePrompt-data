You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Output

    1

    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a):
    from collections import Counter
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input data representing multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of cards `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result indicating the distribution of cards to two players such that each player receives `n` cards and the sum of the cards each player receives is as close as possible.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Game Setup**: 2n cards, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- **Players**: You and Nene, each receive n cards.
- **Game Rules**: Players take turns placing cards on the table. You score a point if a card with the same number is already on the table.
- **Nene's Strategy**: Always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

### Provided Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a):
    from collections import Counter
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - Uses `Counter` from `collections` to count occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - Counts the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`).
   - Returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This logic assumes that:
     - The maximum number of points you can get is the number of pairs you have.
     - However, Nene's optimal play strategy is not accounted for in this simple logic.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads input for multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result.
   - Prints the results.

### Potential Issues:
- **Nene's Strategy**: The current implementation does not consider Nene's optimal strategy. Nene can play in such a way that she maximizes her score and minimizes yours, which might affect the number of points you can score even if you have pairs.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If you have all unique cards, you should score 0 points.
  - If you have all pairs, the score should depend on Nene's strategy.

### Example to Test:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
- You have cards: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Nene has cards: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- If you and Nene play optimally, you can score 0 points because Nene can always place her cards in such a way that you never get a point.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle Nene's optimal strategy. It assumes that the number of points you can score is simply the number of pairs you have, which is not necessarily true given Nene's optimal play.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The code does not account for Nene's optimal strategy, which can affect the number of points you can score. Therefore, it does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get under all potential cases.
