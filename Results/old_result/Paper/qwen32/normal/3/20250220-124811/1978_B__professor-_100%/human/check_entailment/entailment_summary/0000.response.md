### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem description and examples provided.

The program calculates the maximum profit Bob can make by selling his buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**  
     If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all the buns at the usual price `a` to maximize profit. The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**  
     If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is at least `n`, Bob should sell all the buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. This is because the modified prices are higher than the usual price `a` and can be used to maximize profit. The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - n + 1`, which can be calculated using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**  
     If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than `n`, Bob should sell the first `k = b - a` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`. The profit in this case is the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - k + 1` plus the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`. This can be calculated using the formula `((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2) + (a * n)`.

3. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the calculated profit.

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - Since `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the profit is `((5 - 4) * (5 - 4 + 1) // 2) + (4 * 4) = 1 + 16 = 17`.
- **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the profit is `(2 * 9 - 5 + 1) * 5 // 2 = 13 * 5 // 2 = 35`.
- **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.
- **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the profit is `(2 * 11 - 5 + 1) * 5 // 2 = 17 * 5 // 2 = 45`.
- **Example 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
- **Example 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.
- **Example 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - Since `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the profit is `(2 * 1000 - 1000 + 1) * 1000 // 2 = 1001 * 1000 // 2 = 500500`.

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for all the provided examples, indicating that the logic is correct.
