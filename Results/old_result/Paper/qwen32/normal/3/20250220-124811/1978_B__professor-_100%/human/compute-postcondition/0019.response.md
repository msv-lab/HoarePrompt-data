The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable and typically not used within the loop body), and `t` (which controls the number of iterations). Since `_` is not used within the loop body, we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is less than `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
