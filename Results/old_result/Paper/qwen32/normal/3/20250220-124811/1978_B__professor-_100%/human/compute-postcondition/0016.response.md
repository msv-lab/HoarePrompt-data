Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (This seems to be a misstatement since `t` is not defined in the context and does not affect the print statement directly).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, then:
  - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`.
  - If `b - a` is less than `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the relationship between `a` and `b`:**
   - If `b <= a`, the expression `(b - a)` will be non-positive (zero or negative), and the term `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` will be zero or a non-positive integer. Adding `a * n` will result in `a * n` or a value less than `a * n` if `(b - a)` is negative.
   - If `b > a`, then `(b - a)` is positive, and the term `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers, which is the sum of an arithmetic series. Adding `a * n` will shift this sum up by `a * n`.

2. **Evaluate the expression:**
   - The expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers if `b > a`. This is a well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - Adding `a * n` shifts this sum up by `a * n`.

### Conclusion:
- If `b <= a`, the output will be `a * n` or less, depending on the value of `(b - a)`.
- If `b > a`, the output will be the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus `a * n`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n (where (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 is the sum of the first (b - a) natural numbers if b > a, otherwise it is zero or a non-positive integer, and a * n is the product of a and n)**
