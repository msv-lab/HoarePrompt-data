You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100

    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the given problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

Bob has `n` buns to sell, with a usual price `a` per bun. He can choose to sell up to `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1` for the `k`th bun. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to maximize the total profit from selling all `n` buns.

### Cases to Consider:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is never beneficial to sell any buns at the modified price because it would yield less profit. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Total profit = `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all `n` buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. This is because the price reduction per bun is less than the number of buns, ensuring a higher profit.
   - Total profit = Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1` = `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell `b - a` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Total profit = Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1` + `a * (n - (b - a))` = `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * n`.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program correctly implements the above logic:

- **Case 1 (`b <= a`)**: It correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a`.
- **Case 2 (`b - a >= n`)**: It correctly calculates the total profit as `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.
- **Case 3 (`b - a < n`)**: It correctly calculates the total profit as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * n`.

Given that the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
