Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has `n` buns to sell, with a usual price `a` per bun. He can choose to sell up to `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1` for the `k`th bun. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to maximize the total profit from selling all `n` buns.

### Cases to Consider:
1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - Selling buns at the modified price would yield less profit than selling them at the usual price `a`. Hence, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at `a`.
   - Total profit = `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all `n` buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.
   - Total profit = Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1` = `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell `b - a` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Total profit = Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1` + `a * (n - (b - a))` = `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

Let's break down the program logic with respect to the cases:

1. **Case 1 (`b <= a`)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * a`.

2. **Case 2 (`b - a >= n`)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total profit as `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Case 3 (`b - a < n`)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the total profit as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * n`.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. This aligns with the problem description and the program logic.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the function summary accurately describes the program's behavior, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
