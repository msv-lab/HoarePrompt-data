Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`, and if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. If `b - a` is less than `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
