Let's analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

The initial state describes:
- `t` as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, but `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` as integers read from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. `2 * b` - This multiplies the integer `b` by 2.
2. `2 * b - n` - This subtracts the integer `n` from the result of `2 * b`.
3. `2 * b - n + 1` - This adds 1 to the result of `2 * b - n`.
4. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n` - This multiplies the result of `2 * b - n + 1` by the integer `n`.
5. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` - This performs integer division of the result by 2.

The `int()` function is used to ensure the result is an integer, but since the division is already integer division (`//`), the `int()` function doesn't change the result.

So, the expression calculates the value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` and prints it. Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value, but we can describe the expression precisely.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where n and b are integers read from the input)**
