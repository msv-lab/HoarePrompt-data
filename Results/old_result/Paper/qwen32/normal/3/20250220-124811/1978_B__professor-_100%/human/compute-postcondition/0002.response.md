The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, but `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
