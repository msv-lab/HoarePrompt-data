The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` directly, as they are not initialized or modified in the given snippet. The only variable that changes is `t`, which is assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.**
