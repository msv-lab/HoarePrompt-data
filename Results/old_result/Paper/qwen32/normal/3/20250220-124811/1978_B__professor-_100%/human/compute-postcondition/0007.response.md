To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement using the given initial state:

Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for context).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)
```

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Calculate `2 * b`**: This is simply twice the value of `b`.
2. **Subtract `n` from `2 * b`**: This is `2 * b - n`.
3. **Add 1 to the result**: This is `2 * b - n + 1`.
4. **Multiply the result by `n`**: This is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`.
5. **Perform integer division by 2**: This is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

The expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` represents the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b - n + 1` to `b`. This can be understood as follows:

The series is: \( (b - n + 1), (b - n + 2), \ldots, (b - 1), b \).

The number of terms in this series is `n`. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \]

Here, the first term is `b - n + 1` and the last term is `b`. Therefore, the sum is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times ((b - n + 1) + b) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1) \]

This matches the expression inside the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b - n + 1` to `b`.

Output: **The sum of the arithmetic series from \( b - n + 1 \) to \( b \)**
