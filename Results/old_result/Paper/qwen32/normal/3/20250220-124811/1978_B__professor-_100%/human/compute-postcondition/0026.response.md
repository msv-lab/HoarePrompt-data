Output State: **`t` is 0; no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will not be changed as they are specific to each test case and are reset with each new iteration of the loop.
