To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the expression step-by-step using the initial state provided.

The given code snippet is:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Breakdown of the Expression:
1. **`(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**:
   - This part of the expression calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers, starting from `a` to `b`.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\).
   - Here, `k` is `(b - a)`, so the sum of numbers from `a` to `b` is \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2}\).

2. **`a * n`**:
   - This part of the expression is simply `a` multiplied by `n`.

3. **Summing the Two Parts**:
   - The final expression adds the sum of numbers from `a` to `b` to `a * n`.

### Substituting the Values:
- Let's denote `k = b - a`.
- The expression becomes: \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + a * n\).
- This can be written as: \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the above expression, which is the sum of the series from `a` to `b` plus `a * n`.

Output: **\(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\) (where \(b\) and \(a\) are integers such that \(b > a\) and \(b - a < n\))**

This is the most precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state.
