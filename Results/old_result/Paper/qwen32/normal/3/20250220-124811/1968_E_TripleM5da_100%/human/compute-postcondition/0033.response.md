To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step.

The loop is structured as follows:
1. `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, the following steps are performed:
2. `n` is the integer input for each test case.
3. The loop prints `1 1` and `1 2`.
4. For each `i` from 3 to `n`, the loop prints `i i`.

Given that `t` is the number of test cases, the outer loop runs `t` times. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs `n-2` times (from `i=3` to `i=n`).

After all iterations of the loop, the variables will be in the following state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of test cases.
- `n` will be the integer value of the last test case input.
- `i` will be `n + 1` from the last iteration of the inner loop.

The output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **t is unchanged, n is the integer value of the input for the last test case, and i is n + 1.**

In simpler terms, the number of test cases (`t`) remains the same, `n` holds the value from the last test case, and `i` is one more than the value of `n` from the last test case.
