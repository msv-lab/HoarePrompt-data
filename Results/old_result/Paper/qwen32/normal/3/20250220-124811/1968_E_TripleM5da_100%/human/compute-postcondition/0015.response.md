To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(3, n + 1)`. This means that the loop will iterate over values starting from 3 up to `n` inclusive.

Let's break down the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

1. **`n`**: The value of `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute. If `n` is less than 3, the range will be empty and the loop will not execute.
2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 3 at the start of the first iteration. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (this value is not relevant to the loop's execution).
- `n` is the new integer value obtained from the `input()` function.
- `i` is the next integer to be printed, and `i` must be less than `n` (this condition is not relevant to the loop's execution as `i` is reassigned by the loop).

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that it is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is the next integer to be printed, and `i` must be less than `n`**.

However, since `i` is not relevant to the loop's execution and `t` does not affect the loop, the simplified and necessary state adjustment is:

State: **`n` must be at least 3**.
