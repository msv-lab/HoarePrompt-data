The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to the variable `n` based on the user's input, converting the input to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` was already an integer value obtained from the `input()` function, but this value is overwritten. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is the new integer value obtained from the `input()` function, `i` is the next integer to be printed, and `i` must be less than `n`.**
