Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The loop in question is:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `i` is `n - 1`

In the loop head, the variable `i` is the only one that is modified during each iteration. The loop starts with `i` equal to 3 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n`. This means that the next value of `i` should be `n` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `i` is `n`

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is `n`**
