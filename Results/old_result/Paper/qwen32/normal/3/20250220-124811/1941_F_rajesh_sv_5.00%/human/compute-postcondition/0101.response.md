Given the code snippet `h = mid`, we need to update the value of `h` to the value of `mid`. The initial state provides that `mid` is equal to `h // 2`. However, the specific value of `mid` is not given directly, so we can only express `h` in terms of `mid`.

Output State: **`max_diff` is 2, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in A, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `A` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `D` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `F` must contain at least two elements, `left` is 1, `right` is 3, `ans` is 2, `h` is `mid`, `mid_sum` is `5 + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `7 + f`, `l` is 0**
This means the value of `h` is now equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
