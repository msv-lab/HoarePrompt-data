Postcondition: **`max_diff` is `2`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `A` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `D` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `F` must contain at least two elements, `left` is `1`, `right` is `3`, `ans` is `2`, `mid` is `0`, `mid_sum` is `1 + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `3 + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is `1` and `h` is `1`. Otherwise, `l` is `0` and `h` is `0`.**
