The code snippet assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` to the variables `left` and `right`, respectively. This does not affect the values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, or `F`. The only changes are the introduction of the variables `left` and `right` with the specific values from the array `A` based on the `index`.

Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` remain unchanged, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`.**
