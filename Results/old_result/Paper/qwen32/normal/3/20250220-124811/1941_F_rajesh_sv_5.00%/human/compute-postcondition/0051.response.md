The given code snippet updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by adding the value of `f` to `D[mid]` and `D[mid + 1]` respectively. We need to determine the new values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the initial state provided.

From the initial state:
- `D` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`
- `mid` is calculated as `2 + (h - 2) // 2`. Since `h` must be greater than `2` and no specific value for `h` is given, we will assume the simplest case where `h` is `3` to make `mid` equal to `2`.
- `f` is not specified, so we'll keep it as `f`.

Given these values:
- `D[mid]` is `D[2]` which is `5`
- `D[mid + 1]` is `D[3]` which is `7`

Therefore, the new values are:
- `mid_sum` becomes `D[mid] + f` which is `5 + f`
- `mid_next_sum` becomes `D[mid + 1] + f` which is `7 + f`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `n`, `m`, `k` are unchanged, `A` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `D` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `F` must contain at least one element, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is `2`, `h` must be greater than `2`, `mid` is `2 + (h - 2) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `5 + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `7 + f`**.
