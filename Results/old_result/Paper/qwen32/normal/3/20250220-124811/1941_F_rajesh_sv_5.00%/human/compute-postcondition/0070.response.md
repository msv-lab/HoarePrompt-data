The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `l` is `3`.
- `h` is `2`.

Currently, `l` is not less than `h`, so the loop condition `l < h` is not satisfied. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `l` and `h` such that `l` is less than `h`.

One way to do this is to set `l` to a value less than `h`. For example, we can set `l` to `0` and keep `h` as `2`.

State: **`max_diff` is `2`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `A` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `D` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `F` must contain at least two elements, `left` is `1`, `right` is `3`, `ans` is `2`, `mid` is `2`, `mid_sum` is `5 + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `7 + f`, `l` is `0`, `h` is `2`**
