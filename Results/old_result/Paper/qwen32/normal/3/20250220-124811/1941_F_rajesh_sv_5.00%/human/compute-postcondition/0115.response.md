Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5`, and `1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5`. It also accepts three lists: `A` of length `n` with integers in strictly increasing order such that `1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9`, `D` of length `m` with unique integers in sorted order such that `1 <= d_i <= 10^9`, and `F` of length `k` with integers such that `1 <= f_i <= 10^9`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
