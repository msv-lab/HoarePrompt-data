Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, `index` is 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`**

Explanation: The value of `index` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
