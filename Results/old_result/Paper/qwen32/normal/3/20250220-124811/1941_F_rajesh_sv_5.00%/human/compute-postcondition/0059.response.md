The only variable in the loop head is `f` from the list `F`. To execute the loop one more time, `F` must contain at least one more element that has not yet been iterated over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `F` must contain at least one element, and since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `f` should be the next element in `F`.

State: **`max_diff` is `2`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `A` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `D` is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `F` must contain at least two elements, `left` is `1`, `right` is `3`, `ans` is `2`, and `l` equals `h`. `f` is the next element in `F`**
