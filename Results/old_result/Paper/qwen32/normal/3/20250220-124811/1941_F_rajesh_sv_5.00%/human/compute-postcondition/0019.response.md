Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is updated if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is set to `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains `None`, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`**

Natural Language: The value of `next_max_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
