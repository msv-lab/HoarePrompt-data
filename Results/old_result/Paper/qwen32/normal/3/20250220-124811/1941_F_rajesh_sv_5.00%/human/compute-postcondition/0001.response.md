The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, which is the value returned by `func_3()`. The loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once.

Given that we can only adjust the state of `testcases`, we need to ensure that `testcases` is a value that allows the loop to execute. Therefore, `testcases` should be set to a value greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0**
