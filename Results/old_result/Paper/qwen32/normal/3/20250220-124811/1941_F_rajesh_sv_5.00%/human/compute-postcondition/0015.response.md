The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, and since the loop is for `i in range(1, n)`, `i` would have been incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `n` is greater than 1, and assuming `i` was at some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote it as `i + 1` for the next iteration, starting from the initial value of 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` are initialized to `-inf`, `max_diff` is updated if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains `-inf` unless `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, `index` is set to `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains `None`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to make it more concrete and assuming `i` was at the start of the loop (i.e., `i` was 1 at the start of the first iteration), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` are initialized to `-inf`, `max_diff` is updated if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains `-inf` unless `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, `index` is set to `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains `None`, `i` is 2**.
