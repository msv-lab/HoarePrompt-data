The given code snippet appends the integer `v` to the list in the `nodes` dictionary corresponding to the key `u`. This means that the adjacency list for node `u` will now include `v`. 

Since `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists, the list associated with `u` will have `v` added to it. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `i`, and the input pairs `(u, v)` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v`; `i` is 0; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
