The code snippet `ends.append(key)` appends the current node `key` to the `ends` list. Since `ends` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `ends` will contain the single element `key`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v, and `nodes` must contain at least one key-value pair (e.g., nodes[1] = [2]); `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing the single element `key`; the current node `key` in `nodes` has exactly one connected node, i.e., `len(nodes[key]) == 1`.**
