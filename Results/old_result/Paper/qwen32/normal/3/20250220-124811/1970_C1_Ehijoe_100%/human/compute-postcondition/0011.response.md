The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` modifies the `nodes` dictionary by adding `u` to the list of neighbors for the node `v`. This means that if `nodes[v]` already contained a list of neighbors, `u` is appended to that list. If `nodes[v]` was previously empty, it now contains a list with `u` as its only element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `t` is 1.
- The next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.
- The last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `empty` is True.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes `u`.
- `i` is 1.
- `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.
- `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.

After executing `nodes[v].append(u)`, the only change is in the `nodes` dictionary:
- `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes `u`; `i` is 1; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input; `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.**
