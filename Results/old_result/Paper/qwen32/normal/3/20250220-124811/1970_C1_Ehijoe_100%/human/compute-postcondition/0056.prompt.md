Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the element `s`; `prev` is `s`; `curr` is the first connected node to `s` in `nodes[s]`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`; if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `prev` is set to `curr` and `curr` is set to `nodes[curr][0]`. Otherwise, `curr` is set to the second connected node to `s` in `nodes[s]` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`, and now also includes `curr` appended to it; `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]` if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, otherwise `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`; `prev` is updated to the previous value of `curr`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`, and now also includes `curr` appended to it; `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]` if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, otherwise `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`; `prev` is updated to the previous value of `curr`; `curr` must be different from `e`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
