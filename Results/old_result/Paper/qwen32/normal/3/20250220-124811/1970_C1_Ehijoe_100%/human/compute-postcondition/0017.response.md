The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `ends`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the variables `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `i`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is an empty list.**
