The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Given the initial state, `n` is already an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `t` is already an integer with the value 1. The code does not change the values of `n` and `t` but rather reassigns them based on the input. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is 1, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.**
