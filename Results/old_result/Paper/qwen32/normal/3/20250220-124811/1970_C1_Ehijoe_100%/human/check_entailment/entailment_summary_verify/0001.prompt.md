You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

- Function Summary: 
The function reads input describing a tree with exactly two leaves and a starting node. It determines the path between the two leaves and checks the distance of the starting node from each end of this path. Based on whether these distances are odd or even, it prints "Ron" if at least one distance is odd, otherwise it prints "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the program to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Tree Structure**: The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, and it can be viewed as a linear array.
2. **Game Rules**: Players alternate turns moving a stone to an inactive neighbor. The player who can't make a move loses.
3. **Objective**: Determine the winner when the game starts from a given node, assuming both players play optimally.

### Key Insights:
- Since the tree is linear, the game reduces to a linear sequence of nodes.
- The winner depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of moves available from the starting node to both ends of the tree.
- If the starting node is such that the number of moves to one end is odd, Ron wins. If both are even, Hermione wins.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads the edges of the tree.
   - The program identifies the two leaves (endpoints of the tree) and reconstructs the linear sequence of nodes between them.
   - Finally, it reads the starting node.

2. **Reconstructing the Tree**:
   - The tree is reconstructed as a linear sequence from one leaf to the other. This is done by starting from one leaf and following the unique path to the other leaf.

3. **Determining Moves**:
   - The program calculates the number of moves from the starting node to both ends of the tree.
   - If either of these numbers is odd, Ron wins. If both are even, Hermione wins.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the two leaves of the tree.
- It accurately reconstructs the linear sequence of nodes.
- It correctly calculates the number of moves from the starting node to both ends.
- The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of moves is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
