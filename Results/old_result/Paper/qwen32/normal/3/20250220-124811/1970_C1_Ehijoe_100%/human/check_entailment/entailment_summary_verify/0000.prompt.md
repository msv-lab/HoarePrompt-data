You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

- Function Summary: 
The function reads input describing a tree with exactly two leaves and a starting node. It determines the path between the two leaves and checks the distance of the starting node from each end of this path. Based on whether these distances are odd or even, it prints "Ron" if at least one distance is odd, otherwise it prints "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Tree Structure**: The tree has exactly two leaves and can be seen as an array.
- **Game Rules**: 
  - Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from its current node to an adjacent inactive node.
  - The player who cannot make a move loses.
  - Players play optimally.
- **Objective**: Determine the winner for a single round starting from a given node.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads the edges of the tree and constructs an adjacency list `nodes`.
   - It identifies the two leaf nodes (`ends`).
   - It constructs the linear path of the tree from one leaf to the other (`tree`).
   - It reads the starting node of the stone.

2. **Determine Moves**:
   - The program calculates the distance from the starting node to both ends of the tree.
   - It checks if either of these distances is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Tree Structure Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies the two leaves and constructs the path between them.
   - This is critical because the game is played on a linear path.

2. **Move Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distance from the starting node to both ends.
   - It checks if either distance is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
   - This logic is based on the observation that if the number of moves (distance) is odd, the first player (Ron) can force a win by always leaving an even number of moves for the second player (Hermione).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Starting Node is a Leaf**: If the starting node is a leaf, the distance to the other leaf is `n-1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n-1` is always odd, so Ron wins.
   - **Starting Node in the Middle**: If the starting node is in the middle, the program calculates the distances correctly and determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves. It handles the edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation:
The program correctly identifies the two leaves and constructs the path between them. It calculates the distances from the starting node to both ends and determines the winner based on the parity of these distances, which is the correct approach for this problem.
