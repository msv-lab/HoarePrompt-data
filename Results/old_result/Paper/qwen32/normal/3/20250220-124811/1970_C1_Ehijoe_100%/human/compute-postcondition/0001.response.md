The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `edges`. It does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree, or the starting node `u_1`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `edges` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list.**
