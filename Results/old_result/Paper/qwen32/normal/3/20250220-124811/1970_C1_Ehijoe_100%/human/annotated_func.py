#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input describing a tree with exactly two leaves and a starting node. It determines the path between the two leaves and checks the distance of the starting node from each end of this path. Based on whether these distances are odd or even, it prints "Ron" if at least one distance is odd, otherwise it prints "Hermione".
