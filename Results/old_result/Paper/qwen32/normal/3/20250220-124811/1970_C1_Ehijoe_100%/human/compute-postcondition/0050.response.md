The code snippet provided appends the current value of `curr` to the list `tree`. 

The value of `curr` is determined by the previous steps in the code, but it is not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, based on the description, we can infer that `curr` is updated based on the connections in the `nodes` dictionary and the value of `prev`.

Since the code only modifies `tree` by appending `curr`, the other variables remain unchanged. The exact value of `curr` is not given, but we know it is a node in the tree and has been updated according to the logic described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`, and now also includes `curr` appended to it; `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]` if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, otherwise `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`; `prev` is updated to the previous value of `curr`; `curr` must be different from `e`**

In simple terms, the `tree` list now includes the current node `curr` at the end, and all other variables remain unchanged.
