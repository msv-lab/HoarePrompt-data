Postcondition: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `m1` is the same as `m`. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is '01' to '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h`, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.**
