Postcondition: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11', `m1` is the same as `m`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12', `m1` is the same as `m`, and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h`, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings, and `m1` is the same as `m`.**
