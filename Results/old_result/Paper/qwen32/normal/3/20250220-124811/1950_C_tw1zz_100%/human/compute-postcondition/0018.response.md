The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is '04', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `h1` is '04', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `time` is 'AM'**
