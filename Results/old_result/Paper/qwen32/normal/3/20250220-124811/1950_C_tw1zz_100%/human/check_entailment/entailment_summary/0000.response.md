Reasoning: The provided program correctly handles the conversion of times from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format. It checks each possible hour value (`h`) and assigns the correct 12-hour format hour (`h1`) along with the appropriate period ("AM" or "PM"). It also correctly handles the special cases of `00` (midnight) and `12` (noon). The program then prints the converted time in the required format. The execution summary confirms that the function reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and outputs the results as expected.

Correctness: **True**
