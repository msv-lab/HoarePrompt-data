Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where "hh" is a two-digit string representing the hour from "00" to "23" and "mm" is a two-digit string representing the minute from "00" to "59".
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `time` is a string. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02' through '11', then `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' through '23', then `h1` is `h - 12` and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` that do not match the above conditions, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '01', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is `'01'`. If `h` is '02', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is `'02'`. If `h` is '03', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is `'03'`. If `h` is '04', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is `'04'`. If `h` is '05', '06', '07', '08', or '09', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `time` is `'PM'` and `h1` is adjusted to the corresponding 12-hour format. If `h` is '00', `time` is `'AM'` and `h1` is `'12'`. For all other values of `h`, `time` and `h1` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `m1` is the same as `m`. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is '01' to '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h`, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
