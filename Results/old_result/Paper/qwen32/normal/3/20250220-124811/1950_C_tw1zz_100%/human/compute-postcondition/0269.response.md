Postcondition: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `m1` is the same as `m`. If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` are set based on the value of `h`: '09' to '11' map to '09' to '11' AM, '12' maps to '12' PM, '13' to '23' map to '01' to '11' PM, and '00' maps to '12' AM. For all other values of `h`, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.**
