Postcondition: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12', `m1` is the same as `m`, and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string, `m1` is the same as `m`, and `time` remains an empty string.**
