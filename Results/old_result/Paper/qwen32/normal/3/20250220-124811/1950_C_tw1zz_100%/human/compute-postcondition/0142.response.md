Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `time` is an empty string, `h1` is '08', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.`**

In simpler terms, the variable `h1` has been updated to the string '08'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
