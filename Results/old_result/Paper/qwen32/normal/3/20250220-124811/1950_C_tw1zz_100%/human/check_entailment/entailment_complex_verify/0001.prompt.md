You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, converting each 24-hour formatted time "hh:mm" into a 12-hour format "h1:mm AM/PM" and printing it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format "hh:mm". It then converts this time into 12-hour format "h:mm AM/PM" and prints the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert a given time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the time in the format "hh:mm", splits it into hours and minutes, and then uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent 12-hour format and the corresponding period (AM or PM). The program then prints the converted time with the correct period.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Redundancy in Code**: The program uses a series of if-elif statements to handle each hour from 00 to 23. This can be simplified using arithmetic operations to avoid repetitive code.
2. **String Formatting**: The program uses multiple print statements with `sep=''` to format the output. A more concise and readable approach would be to use formatted strings.
3. **Handling Leading Zeros**: The program ensures that the minutes are printed with leading zeros, but it does not explicitly handle the conversion of hours to maintain leading zeros in the 12-hour format. For example, converting "00:00" to "12:00 AM" requires ensuring that "12" is printed with a leading zero if necessary.

Despite these points, the program does correctly convert the given times in the test cases to their 12-hour format equivalents and outputs them as specified. Thus, the program is functionally correct for the given problem description and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
