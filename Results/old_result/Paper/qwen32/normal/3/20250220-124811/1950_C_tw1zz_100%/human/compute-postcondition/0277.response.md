Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `h`: A string representing the hour part of the input time.
   - `m`: A string representing the minute part of the input time.
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this analysis.
   - `m1`: The same as `m`.
   - `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '02' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is '01' to '11' (by subtracting 12 from `h`) and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - For all other values of `h`, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.

2. **Print statement:**
   - `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`
   - The `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no spaces between the printed elements.

3. **Determining the output:**
   - The output will depend on the value of `h` and `m`.
   - Let's consider a few cases based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '01', `h1` will be '01' and `time` will be 'AM'. The output will be `01:m AM`.
     - If `h` is '02', `h1` will be '02' and `time` will be 'AM'. The output will be `02:m AM`.
     - If `h` is '12', `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'PM'. The output will be `12:m PM`.
     - If `h` is '13', `h1` will be '01' and `time` will be 'PM'. The output will be `01:m PM`.
     - If `h` is '23', `h1` will be '11' and `time` will be 'PM'. The output will be `11:m PM`.
     - If `h` is '00', `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'AM'. The output will be `12:m AM`.

Since the exact value of `h` and `m` are not provided, we need to describe the output in a general form based on the conditions given.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the adjusted hour based on the value of h and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions given)**
