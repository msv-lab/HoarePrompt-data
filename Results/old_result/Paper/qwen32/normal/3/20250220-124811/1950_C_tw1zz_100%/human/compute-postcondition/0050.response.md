Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time and `h` is equal to '12', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `h1` is '12', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `time` is 'PM'.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `time` is now set to the string 'PM'. All other variables retain their initial values.
