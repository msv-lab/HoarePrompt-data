Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The logic in the program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. It does not correctly account for the fact that the players can choose to stay or move in each turn. The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum score for each player is achieved by multiplying the highest value encountered by the remaining number of turns.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `n` iterations, but it should run for `k` iterations, as the game lasts for `k` turns.

3. **Incorrect Update of Scores**: The scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated incorrectly. The program should consider the choice of staying or moving at each turn, but it does not do so.

4. **Incorrect Use of `max` Function**: The use of `max` in updating `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. The `max` function is used to find the maximum possible score, but the program does not correctly simulate the choices of staying or moving.

5. **Incorrect Handling of Indices**: The program subtracts 1 from the starting positions `b` and `s` to convert them to 0-based indexing, but it does not consistently apply this adjustment when accessing elements in the permutation array `p`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game for `k` turns, considering the choices of staying or moving for each player, and then compare their final scores. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            if a[p[b] - 1] > a[b]:
                b = p[b] - 1
            if a[p[s] - 1] > a[s]:
                s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game for `k` turns, considering the choices of staying or moving for each player, and then compares their final scores.
