Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 4; `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`; `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `k` is decreased by 1`. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, which means it now points to the element in `p` at the index that was previously the value of `p[b] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
