The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the variable `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `sp` is `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1]`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`

After the execution of `sp += a[s]`, the new value of `sp` will be `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] + a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
