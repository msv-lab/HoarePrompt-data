The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the `for` loop statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. The value of `n` remains the same, but it must still be greater than 4 to allow the loop to continue.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `k` is -1; `i` is 4; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**
