### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1.

2. **Initial Scores**:
   - It initializes `sp` (Sasha's position score) and `bp` (Bodya's position score) to the values of `a` at their starting positions.
   - It initializes `bm` (Bodya's maximum score) and `sm` (Sasha's maximum score) to the product of their initial scores and `k`.

3. **Simulating the Game**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, but `k` decrements each iteration, and the loop breaks if `k` reaches 0.
   - Inside the loop, both players move to their next positions according to the permutation `p`.
   - The program updates `bm` and `sm` to the maximum scores possible by either staying or moving to the next position.
   - It also updates `sp` and `bp` to the cumulative scores if they stay at their positions.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the loop, it compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `n` times, but it should run `k` times. The loop should continue until `k` reaches 0, not `n`.
- **Score Calculation**: The calculation of `bm` and `sm` is flawed. The program should consider the maximum score achievable by either staying or moving in each turn, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns and correctly calculate the maximum possible scores for both players.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the current implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
