Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 3; `k` is -1; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp)`. Since `k` is -1 and not 0, we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
