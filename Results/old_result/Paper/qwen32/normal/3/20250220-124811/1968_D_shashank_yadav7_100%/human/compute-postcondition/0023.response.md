The code snippet `k -= 1` decreases the value of `k` by 1. Based on the initial state, `k` is either 0 or a value that is decreased by 1 if the condition `k == 0` is not true. Since `k` is 0 in the initial state, after executing `k -= 1`, `k` becomes -1. 

The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[s] * k + sp)`**
