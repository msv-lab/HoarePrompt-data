Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is 0; `i` is 2; `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations; `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations; `bm` is less than `sm` if the initial condition `bm < sm` is true, otherwise `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.**
