The given initial state provides a context for several variables and their relationships, but it does not specify the exact values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, or `sm`. The print statement is simply `print('Draw')`, which means it will output the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input value.
- `k` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is initialized to 2.
- `s` and `b` are the final values of these variables after all iterations.
- `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input.
- `sp` and `bp` are cumulative sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` over the number of iterations.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

Despite the detailed description of the variables and their roles, the print statement does not reference any of these variables directly. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
