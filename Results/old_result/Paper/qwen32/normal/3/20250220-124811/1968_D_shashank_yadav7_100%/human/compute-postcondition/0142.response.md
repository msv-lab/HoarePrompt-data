The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 5; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[b] + a[b]`; `bm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`; `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `k` is decreased by 1. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The value of `sp` is now three times `a[s]` because we added `a[s]` to its previous value of `2 * a[s] + a[s]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
