The code snippet provided is `k -= 1`, which decrements the value of `k` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 4; `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`; `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `k` is decreased by 1.**
