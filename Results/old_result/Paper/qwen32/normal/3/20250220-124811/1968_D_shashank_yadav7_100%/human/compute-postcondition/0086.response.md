Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `k` is -2; `i` is 4; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp, a[s] * k + sp)`. Since the condition `k == 0` is not met (as `k` is -2), the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
