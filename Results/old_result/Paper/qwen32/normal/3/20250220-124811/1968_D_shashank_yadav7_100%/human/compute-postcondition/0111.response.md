Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is the input value; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations.**

Explanation: The value of `bm` has been updated to `a[b] * k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
