To determine the new value of `bm` after executing the given code snippet, we need to evaluate the expression `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. 

Given:
- `bm` is `a[b]`
- `k` is `-1`
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`

Let's substitute these values into the expression:

`bm = max(a[b], a[b] * (-1) + 2 * a[b])`
`bm = max(a[b], -a[b] + 2 * a[b])`
`bm = max(a[b], a[b])`
`bm = a[b]`

Since `bm` is already equal to `a[b]`, the value of `bm` does not change after executing the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State remains:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 3; `k` is -1; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp)`**
