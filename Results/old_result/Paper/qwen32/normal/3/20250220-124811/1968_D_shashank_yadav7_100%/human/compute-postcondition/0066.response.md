Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true; `i` is 2 if `k` is 0; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]` if `k` is 0, otherwise it retains its original value; `bm` is 0 if `k` is 0, otherwise it retains its original value; `sm` is 0 if `k` is 0, otherwise it retains its original value.**
