Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all cases for partitioning the string into non-palindrome substrings. Here are some issues and counterexamples:

1. **Handling of Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and prints "NO". This part is correct.

2. **Handling of Strings with the Same Character**: The program correctly identifies that a string consisting of the same character cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and prints "NO". This part is also correct.

3. **Handling of Strings with Different Characters**: The program attempts to find a partition if the string is not a palindrome by checking for the first mismatch. However, it does not correctly handle all cases where a string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

For example, consider the string "abacaba". The program will identify that it is a palindrome and try to find a partition. However, it does not correctly identify that this string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings such as "aba", "c", "aba".

4. **Complexity and Edge Cases**: The program's logic for finding partitions is overly complex and does not cover all edge cases. For instance, it does not correctly handle cases where a string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindrome substrings.

To fix the program, a simpler and more robust approach would be to check if the string itself is a palindrome. If it is not, then the entire string can be a single non-palindrome substring. If it is, then try to find a partition by splitting the string into smaller substrings and checking if they are non-palindromes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        if not is_palindrome(s):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(s)
        else:
            n = len(s)
            found = False
            for j in range(1, n):
                if not is_palindrome(s[:j]) and not is_palindrome(s[j:]):
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(s[:j], s[j:])
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This version of the program correctly handles all cases by checking if the string itself is a palindrome and then attempting to partition it into two non-palindrome substrings if necessary.
