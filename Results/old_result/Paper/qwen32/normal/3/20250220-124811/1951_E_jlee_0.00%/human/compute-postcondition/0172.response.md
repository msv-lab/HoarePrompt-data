Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is `False`; `count` and `count2` are integers based on the loop conditions; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

Natural Language Description: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and the loop variable `j` remain unchanged, except that the loop will move to the next value of `j` in the next iteration.
