Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, then `count` is set to the value of `j`. If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains as described without any additional changes.**
