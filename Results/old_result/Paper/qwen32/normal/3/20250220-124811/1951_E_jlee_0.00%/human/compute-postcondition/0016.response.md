Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand; `string` is an input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, the condition is satisfied without any further changes to the variables. Otherwise, the condition is not met and no changes are made to the variables.**
