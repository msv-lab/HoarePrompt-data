Postcondition: **done is False, j is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, count is the index of the first character not equal to x if such a character was found before count was set, otherwise 0, count2 is the number of characters equal to x encountered after count was set, if count was set, otherwise 0, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value, string is the user input, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of string, x is the first character of string.
