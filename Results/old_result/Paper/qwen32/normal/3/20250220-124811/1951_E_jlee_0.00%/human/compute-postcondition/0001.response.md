In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the range of `t`, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `t` must be at least 1, as the range function will generate numbers from 0 up to `t-1`. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand; it will be initialized by the loop.

Given that `t` is already provided as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts since it is controlled by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand**
