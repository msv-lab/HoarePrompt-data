To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand.
- `string` is an input string with a length of 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` containing exactly one character.
- `n` is the length of `string` and equals 1.
- `done` is `False`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('NO')
```

**Analysis:**
The `print` statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, and `done` are not used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

**Output:**
Output: **NO**
