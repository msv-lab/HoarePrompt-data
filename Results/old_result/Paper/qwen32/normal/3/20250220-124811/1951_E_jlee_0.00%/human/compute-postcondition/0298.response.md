The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`done`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`) are affected by the `continue` statement. The loop will simply move to its next iteration.

Output State: **`done` is False, `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `count` and `count2` reflect the state after the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`**.
