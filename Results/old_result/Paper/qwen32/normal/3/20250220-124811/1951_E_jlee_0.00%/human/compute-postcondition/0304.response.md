Output State: **`done` is False, `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `count` and `count2` reflect the state after the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, and `x` is the first character of `string`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
