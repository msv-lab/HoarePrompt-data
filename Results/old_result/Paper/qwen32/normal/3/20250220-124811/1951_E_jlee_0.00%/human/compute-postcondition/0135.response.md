Let's analyze the given task and the initial state to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is the loop variable (though it's mentioned but not used in the given snippet).
- `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count` and `count2` are integers (their initial values are not specified).
- `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1 (implying `j` is incremented in some loop).
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value `'YES'` is explicitly given and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `j`, or `done`. 

Therefore, regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions in the loop, the output of the `print` statement will be `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
