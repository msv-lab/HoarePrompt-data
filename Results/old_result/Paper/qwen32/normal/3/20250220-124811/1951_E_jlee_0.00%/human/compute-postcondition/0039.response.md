Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `True`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`**

In this output state, the variable `done` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
