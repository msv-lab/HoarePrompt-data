Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with length 1 <= |s| <= 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `done` is `False`; `count` and `count2` are integers based on the loop conditions; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. The current value of `done` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: done is False, j is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, and count and count2 reflect the state after the last iteration. Since the if condition is not dependent on changing these variables, they retain their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: done is False, j is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, count is the index of the first character not equal to x if such a character was found before count was set, otherwise 0, count2 is the number of characters equal to x encountered after count was set, if count was set, otherwise 0, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value, string is the user input, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of string, x is the first character of string. Additionally, the condition (not done) is True, meaning done remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
