Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is `True` if `count2` is greater than `count`; `count` is set to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`; `count2` is incremented by 1 for each `s[j]` not equal to `x` if `count` is greater than 0; `done` is also `True` if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; `count2` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.**
