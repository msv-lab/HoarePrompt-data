The `print(string)` statement will output the value of the `string` variable as it is. According to the initial state, `string` is an input string. The value of `string` is not explicitly provided, but it is described as an input string that has a first character not equal to its last character.

Since the exact value of `string` is not given, we can't provide the exact string content. However, based on the information provided, the print statement will output the entire `string` as it is.

Output: **string (where string is the input string)**
