Postcondition: **`done` is True if `count2` is greater than `count` or if `count > 1` or if the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - j` in `s`. Otherwise, `done` remains False. `j` is 0. `count` is 0 if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged. `count2` is 1 if `count > 1` and the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to `x`, otherwise `count2` is 0 if `count <= 1` or `s[j] != x`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. `string` is the user input. `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `n` must be at least 1. `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `done` is set to True or if `count2` is a positive integer less than `count`.**
