Given the initial state, we can determine the exact value that will be printed by the `print` statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Values**:
   - `done` is `False`.
   - `j` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the `string`.
   - `count` and `count2` reflect the state after the last iteration.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `string` is the user input.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `string`.
   - `x` is the first character of `string`.
   - If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `done`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, and `x`.
   - The condition `If x is not equal to the last character of s` does not affect the `print` statement because the print statement is not dependent on this condition but rather outputs a fixed string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
