The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure (`for` or `while`), so the `continue` statement does not have any effect. Therefore, none of the variables are modified, and the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand; `string` is an input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string` and is not equal to the last character of `string`.**
