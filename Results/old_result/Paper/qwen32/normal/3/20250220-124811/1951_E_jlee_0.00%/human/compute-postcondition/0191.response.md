Given the initial state and the context provided, we need to determine what the `print('YES')` statement will output. Let's break down the information given:

1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value (not directly relevant to the print statement).
3. **`string`**: A new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from the new `string`.
5. **`n`**: The length of the new `string` and must be at least 1.
6. **`x`**: The first character of the new `string`.
7. **`done`**: A boolean variable that becomes `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for some `j` in the range from 0 to \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\). Otherwise, it remains `False`.
8. **`count`**: Greater than 0, indicating that `s[j]` was not equal to `x` for some `j` before the loop was broken.
9. **`count2`**: Greater than 0 and less than `count`.
10. **`j`**: The loop variable iterating from 0 to \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\) and the loop was broken when `count` became greater than 0.
11. **`s[j]`**: Not equal to `x`.

The key point here is that the print statement `print('YES')` is executed without any conditions or variables being part of the print statement itself. Therefore, the output will simply be the string 'YES'.

Given this, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
