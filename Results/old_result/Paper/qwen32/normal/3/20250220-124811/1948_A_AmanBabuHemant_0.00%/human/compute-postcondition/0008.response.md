The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `s`), but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not reference any of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50. However, it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is an even integer. This detail is also not relevant to the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `s`**: It is a string constructed by repeating the substring `'110'` `n // 2` times. The length of this string is less than 200. This variable is also not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
