Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer; if the new `n` is odd, then `s` is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the new `n` is even, then `s` is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; `_` is incremented by 1. The length of `s` is less than 200 or the length of `s` is 200 or more, but the operations on `t`, `n`, `s`, and `_` remain consistent with the described behavior.**
