Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem statement:

1. **Character Set**: The problem requires the string to be composed of uppercase Latin letters, but the program uses the characters '1', '1', and '0'. This does not meet the requirement.

2. **Special Characters Definition**: The program defines special characters as '1' and '0', which are not valid according to the problem description (which specifies uppercase Latin letters).

3. **Special Characters Count**: The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The string '110' * (n // 2) does not necessarily satisfy this condition for all values of `n`.

4. **Length Constraint**: The program checks if the length of the string is less than 200 before printing 'YES', but it should always be able to construct a valid string of length at most 200 if one exists.

To fix these issues, the program should construct a string using uppercase Latin letters and ensure that the number of special characters is exactly `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AA' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

In this corrected version:

- The string is constructed using 'AA' repeated `n // 2` times, which ensures that every character is a special character (since each 'A' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors).
- The length of the resulting string is always `2 * (n // 2)`, which is at most 100 (since `n` is at most 50), so it will always be less than 200.
- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO', as it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
