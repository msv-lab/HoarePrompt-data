Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is a new input integer.
- If `n` is odd, it remains unchanged.
- If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is checked:
  - If the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200.
  - Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.
- `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `s` is defined as `'110' * (n // 2)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `_` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the conditions and calculations described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `_`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
