The code snippet provided initializes a dictionary `cnt` without changing the values of `n`, `a`, or `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) remain unaffected as they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a line containing `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases is given by the first integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) in the input. `n` is an integer read from the input. `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. `ans` is 0. `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**
