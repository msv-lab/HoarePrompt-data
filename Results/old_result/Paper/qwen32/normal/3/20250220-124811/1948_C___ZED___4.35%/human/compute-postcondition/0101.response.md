Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is False if the current character at index `k` in `b` is not `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True, `k` is 4. Since the `if` condition checks if `b[k] != '>'`, `no_path` will be False if `b[4]` is not `'>'`.**

To summarize: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, `k` is 4. If the character at index 4 in `b` is not `'>'`, `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
