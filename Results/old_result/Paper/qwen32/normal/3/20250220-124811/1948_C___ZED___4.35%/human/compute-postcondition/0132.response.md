Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` made up of '<' and '>' characters. It prints 'YES' if it is possible to make the grid valid by potentially reversing some arrows, such that no two arrows point towards each other in the same column, and 'NO' otherwise.**
