Let's break down the given initial state and the `print` statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is at least 6.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is the new input string.
- `no_path` is False.
- At least one character at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `n` in `b` is not `'>'`.
- The current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.
- `k` is 5.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is explicitly given a value in the initial state as 5.
- The `print` statement is simply outputting the value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
Since `k` is explicitly defined as 5, the `print(k)` statement will output the value 5.

### Output:
Output: **5**
