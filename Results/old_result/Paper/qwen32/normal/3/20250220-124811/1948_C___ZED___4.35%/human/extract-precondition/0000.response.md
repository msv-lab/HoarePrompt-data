Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even. The following two lines for each test case contain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
