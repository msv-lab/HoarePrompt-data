Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, and at least one character at even indices in `b` is not `'>'`. `no_path` is `False`. `k` is 5.**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been explicitly set to `False` by the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as described in the initial state.
