Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string. If the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is a boolean indicating whether any character at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `n` in `b` is not `'>'`, and `k` is the last odd number less than `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
