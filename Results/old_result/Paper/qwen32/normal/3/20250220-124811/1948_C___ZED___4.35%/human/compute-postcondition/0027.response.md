Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', `no_path` is `False`, and `a[k]` is not equal to '>'**

Natural language: The value of `no_path` has been changed to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
