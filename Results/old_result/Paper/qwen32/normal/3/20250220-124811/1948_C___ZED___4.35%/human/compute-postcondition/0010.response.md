The code snippet provided only initializes a new variable `no_path` to `True`. None of the existing variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`) are modified. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>'; `no_path` is True.**
