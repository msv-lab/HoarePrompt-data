The code snippet provided sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be at least 2, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>'. `no_path` is False. The current character `b[k]` is not '>'**.
