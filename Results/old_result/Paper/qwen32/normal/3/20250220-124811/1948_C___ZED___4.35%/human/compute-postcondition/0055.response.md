The value of `no_path` is changed from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and the character at index `k` in `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `no_path` is False, and the character at index `k` in `b` is not '>'**.
