Precondition: **k, a, b, and n are integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**

Note: The function definition provided (`def func_1(k, a, b, n):`) does not match the problem description, which suggests that the parameters should be `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, with `k` being a variable to be determined within the function to maximize profit. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, a, b):` and `k` should be calculated inside the function. However, based on the given function definition, the precondition is described as above.
