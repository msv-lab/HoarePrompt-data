You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns True if the calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` for the `i-th` bun, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`. We need to find the optimal `k` to maximize the profit.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are read.

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - `low` is initialized to 0.
   - `high` is initialized to `n`.
   - `ans` is initialized to -1, which will store the optimal `k`.

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - The binary search loop runs as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - The function `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` is called to check if selling `mid` buns at the modified price is valid.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the total price if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.
   - The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is checked. However, this condition does not correctly determine the maximum profit; it merely checks whether the total price is less than or equal to the product of `n` and the maximum of `a` and `b`.
   - The function should instead calculate the total profit for a given `k` and compare it with the profit for other values of `k` to find the maximum.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program's logic for determining the optimal `k` is flawed because:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the profit for a given `k`.
- The binary search is not used to find the maximum profit but instead checks an incorrect condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Compute the profit for each possible `k` from 0 to `n`.
- The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{profit}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \cdot a
  \]
- Find the maximum profit among all possible values of `k`.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
