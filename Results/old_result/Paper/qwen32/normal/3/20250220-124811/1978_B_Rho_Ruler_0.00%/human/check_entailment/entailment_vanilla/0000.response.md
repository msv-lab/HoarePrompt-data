Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns with the following conditions:
1. The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price: the `i-th` bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins.
2. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price of `a` coins each.

The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Program Analysis

The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k`. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` is set to 0.
   - `high` is set to `n`.
   - `ans` is initialized to -1.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The loop continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - The function `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` is called to check if selling `mid` buns at the modified price is feasible.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the total price if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is checked, but this condition does not make sense in the context of maximizing profit. The function should actually compute the total profit and compare it with the current maximum profit.

### Issues with the Program

- The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` in `func_1` is incorrect. It should calculate the total profit and compare it with the current maximum profit.
- The program does not correctly compute the profit for a given `k`. Instead, it checks a condition that does not relate to maximizing profit.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the total profit for each possible `k` (from 0 to `n`).
2. Track the maximum profit encountered.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain. It uses an incorrect condition in `func_1` and does not properly calculate the profit for each `k`.

**Correctness: False**
