You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k, a, b, and n are integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(k, a, b, n):

    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` with the constraints 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns True if the calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and the logic used in the binary search to find the optimal `k`.

The `func_1` function calculates the total revenue for a given `k` but it does not correctly represent the profit for selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price. Specifically, it adds `k * b` to the total revenue, which is incorrect because the price of the i-th bun should be `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k`.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function and the main logic to find the maximum profit:

```python
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    # Calculate the revenue from selling the first k buns at the modified price
    modified_price_revenue = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))
    # Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price
    usual_price_revenue = (n - k) * a
    # Total revenue
    total_revenue = modified_price_revenue + usual_price_revenue
    return total_revenue

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        # Iterate over all possible values of k from 0 to n
        for k in range(n + 1):
            current_profit = func_1(k, a, b, n)
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        print(max_profit)
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n` and calculate the total revenue for each `k`. We then keep track of the maximum revenue, which represents the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

The original program's binary search approach is incorrect because it does not properly evaluate the revenue for each `k` and instead uses an incorrect condition to determine the maximum profit.
