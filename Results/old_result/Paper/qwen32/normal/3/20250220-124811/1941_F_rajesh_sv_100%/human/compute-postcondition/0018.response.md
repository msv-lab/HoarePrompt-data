Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff` and `next_max_diff` is set to the previous value of `max_diff`; `index` is `i`. Otherwise, if `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff` and greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged. `i` is 3; `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`.**

Natural language: The value of `next_max_diff` is now equal to the value of `max_diff`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
