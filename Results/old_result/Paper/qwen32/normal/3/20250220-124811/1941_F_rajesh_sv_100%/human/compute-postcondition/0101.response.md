The code snippet calculates the midpoint between `l` and `h` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `f` is the next value in `F`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**
