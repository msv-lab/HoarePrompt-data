The value of `index` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables (`n`, `diff`, `max_diff`, and `next_max_diff`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. The current value of `diff` is greater than `max_diff`; `max_diff` is equal to `diff`; `next_max_diff` is equal to the previous value of `max_diff`; `index` is `i`.**
