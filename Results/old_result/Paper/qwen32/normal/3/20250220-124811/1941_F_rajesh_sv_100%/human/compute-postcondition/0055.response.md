Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is `max_diff`; `D` has at least two elements; `l` is `mid + 1`; `h` is adjusted such that `l < h`; `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In simple terms, the variable `l` is now set to `mid + 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
