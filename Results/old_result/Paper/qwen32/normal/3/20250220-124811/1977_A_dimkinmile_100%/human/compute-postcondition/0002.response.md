The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) and their constraints, but the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is simply `print('Yes')`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`. It will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the input values.

Let's break it down:
- The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- The variables `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- The difference `n - m` is a non-negative even integer.

However, none of these conditions affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
