### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and verify the logic of the program step by step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two operations:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

The task is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after performing `n` moves. 

To achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the following must hold true:
- The number of add operations minus the number of remove operations must equal `m`.
- Since each operation changes the number of cubes by 1, the total number of operations (additions and removals combined) must be `n`.

Let's denote:
- `a` as the number of add operations.
- `r` as the number of remove operations.

We have the following equations:
1. `a - r = m`
2. `a + r = n`

By adding these two equations, we get:
\[ 2a = m + n \]
\[ a = \frac{m + n}{2} \]

For `a` to be an integer, `m + n` must be even. This implies that `n - m` must also be even (since `n - m = (n + m) - 2m` and subtracting an even number from an even number results in an even number).

Additionally, `n - m >= 0` must hold true to ensure that it is possible to have at least `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `kreker`. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. In `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's verify if these conditions correctly determine the possibility of ending up with `m` cubes after `n` moves:
- The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n` (i.e., it's possible to have at least `m` cubes if we start from 0).
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of add and remove operations is even, which is necessary to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Both conditions are correct and sufficient to determine the answer.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- Inside the function `func_1()`: The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and prints "Yes" if the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even integer, otherwise it prints "No".

The annotations correctly describe the logic and the state of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given problem description.

Final: **True**
