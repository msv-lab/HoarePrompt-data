### Reasoning:
To determine if Nikita can build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the nature of the operations allowed: adding or removing exactly one cube per move.

The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can be any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive), and the parity (evenness or oddness) of `n` and `m` must align in a specific way:
- If `n` is even, the final number of cubes `m` must also be even because adding or removing cubes in pairs will preserve the parity.
- If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes `m` can be either even or odd because a single operation will change the parity.

In the provided program, the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` is used to determine if it's possible:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which means that the parity of `n` and `m` is the same.
- `n - m >= 0` ensures that it's possible to end up with `m` cubes without needing to remove more cubes than were added (i.e., `m` is not greater than `n`).

However, the condition `n - m >= 0` is not strictly necessary because if `n` is odd, `m` can be greater than `n` (e.g., `n = 5`, `m = 3` is valid). The correct condition should only check the parity:
- If `n` is even, `m` must be even.
- If `n` is odd, `m` can be either even or odd.

Thus, the correct condition should be just `((n - m) % 2 == 0)`.

### Correctness:
Given the provided program, the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` is overly restrictive and does not correctly handle all cases where `m` can be validly achieved. For example, with `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the condition fails because `5 - 3 >= 0` is true but `5 - 3` is even, which is correct, but the program would still print "No" because `n - m >= 0` is not the only necessary condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the unnecessary `n - m >= 0` condition.

Correctness: **False**
