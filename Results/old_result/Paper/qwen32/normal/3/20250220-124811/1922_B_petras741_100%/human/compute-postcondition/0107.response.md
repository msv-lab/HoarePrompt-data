Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `i` remains 2, `buffer` remains an empty list, and `n` remains the same. The list `w` of `n` integers is unchanged. The list `q` of `n + 1` integers has each element at index `w[j]` incremented by 1 for every integer `j` from 0 to `n-1`. The loop index `j` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times.
