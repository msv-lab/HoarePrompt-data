Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`.**

In natural language: The value of `rho` is now set to the value of `q[eta[0]]`, which is the first element in the list `q` corresponding to the first index in the list `eta` where `q[j]` is greater than 0. All other variables retain their previous values.
