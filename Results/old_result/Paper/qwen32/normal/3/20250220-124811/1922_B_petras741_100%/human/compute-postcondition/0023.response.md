The code snippet provided appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given the initial state, `j` is 2. Therefore, the value 2 will be added to the `eta` list.

Since `eta` initially contains all indices `j` for which `q[j] > 0` and possibly the value 1 if `q[1] > 0`, the only change here is the addition of the value 2 to `eta`.

All other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` for which `q[j] > 0` and possibly the value 1 if `q[1] > 0`, and now also contains the value 2, `j` is 2.**
