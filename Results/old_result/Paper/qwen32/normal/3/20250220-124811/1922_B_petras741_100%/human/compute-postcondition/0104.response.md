The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the value at index `w[3]` in `q` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[3]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is 3**
