Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, `eta` is a list containing all values of `j` for which `q[j] > 0`, `j` is 2, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once plus `q[eta[1]]`, `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[1]]) + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state description.
