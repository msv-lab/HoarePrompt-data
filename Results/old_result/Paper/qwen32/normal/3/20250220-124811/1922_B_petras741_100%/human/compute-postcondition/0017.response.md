The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the `eta` list. This means that the `eta` list, which was initially empty, now contains the value of `j` as its first element.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` remains an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` remains 0, `buffer` remains an empty list, `n` remains the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` remains a list of integers derived from the input. The list `q` also remains unchanged, as it is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, and `q[j] > 0` for the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j`.**
