Output State: **`j` is 1, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is updated to `rho + q[eta[1]]`.**

In natural language: The value of `rho` is increased by `q[eta[1]]`. The values of `j` and `eta_ln` remain unchanged. The expression for `res` is updated to include the new value of `rho`.
