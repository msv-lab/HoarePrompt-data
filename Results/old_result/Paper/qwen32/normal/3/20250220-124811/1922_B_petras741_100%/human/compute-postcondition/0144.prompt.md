Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` is a list of integers derived from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, `eta` is a list containing all values of `j` for which `q[j] > 0`. If `eta_ln` (the length of `eta`) equals 1, `j` is `n` and `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once. Otherwise, `j` is `eta_ln - 1`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once plus the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional variables are defined and `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the accumulated sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the new input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` contains all values `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
