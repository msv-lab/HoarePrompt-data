Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, `eta` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `eta = []` initializes a new empty list named `eta`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the Initial State.
