The code snippet `nums = [0] * n` initializes a list named `nums` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `k` are integers with specific constraints, but the code only affects the `nums` list. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**
