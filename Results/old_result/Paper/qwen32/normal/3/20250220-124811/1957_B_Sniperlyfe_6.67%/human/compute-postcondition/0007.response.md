The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, if `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

The variable `n` does not change throughout the iterations and remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 minus `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` minus `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums` is a list where `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
