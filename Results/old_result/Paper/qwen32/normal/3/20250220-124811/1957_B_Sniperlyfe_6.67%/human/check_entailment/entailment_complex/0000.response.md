### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

Let's break down the function `func_1(n, k)` and see if it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
   
2. **Distributing Values**:
   - The function then iterates `n` times, setting each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This expression calculates the maximum value that can be represented with the number of bits required to represent `k`. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), `k.bit_length()` is 3, and `(1 << 3 - 1) - 1` equals 3 (binary `11`).
   
3. **Adjusting for Sum**:
   - After setting the first `n-1` elements, the function adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of `nums`. This ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k`.

4. **Maximizing the Number of 1s in Bitwise OR**:
   - The key to maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is to ensure that each bit position is set to 1 as often as possible. The program does not explicitly focus on this, but by setting each element to the maximum possible value with the number of bits in `k`, it attempts to achieve this goal. However, the approach is flawed because it does not consider the distribution of bits across all elements to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Issues with the Approach:

- **Bitwise OR Maximization**: The approach of setting each element to the maximum possible value with the number of bits in `k` does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s. For example, if `k` is 5 and `n` is 2, the program will set the first element to 3 (binary `11`) and the second element to 2 (binary `10`), resulting in a bitwise OR of `11` (binary `11`), which has only 2 1s. A better solution would be to use elements like 1 and 4 (binary `100`), resulting in a bitwise OR of `101` (binary `101`), which has 3 1s.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
