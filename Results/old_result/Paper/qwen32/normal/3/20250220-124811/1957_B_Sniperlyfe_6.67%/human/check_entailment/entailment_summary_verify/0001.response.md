### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary in detail to determine if the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is `k`.
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` generates a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is initialized to the maximum value that can be represented with the number of bits in `k`. It then increases the last element of `nums` by the remaining value of `k` after distributing the initial values.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
2. **Loop through indices**: For each index `i` in the range `n`, it sets `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1. It then subtracts this value from `k`.
3. **Adjust the last element**: After the loop, it adds the remaining `k` to the last element of `nums`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**: The approach of setting each element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. This strategy tends to create large numbers with many 1s, but it does not necessarily distribute the 1s optimally across the sequence.
   
2. **Handling of Remaining Sum**: Simply adding the remaining sum to the last element does not contribute to maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For instance, if `k` is large and `n` is small, this approach might result in a single large number with many 1s, but the bitwise OR of a sequence with more numbers having 1s in different positions could yield more 1s.

#### Optimal Strategy:
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, a better approach would be to distribute the sum `k` using smaller numbers that have 1s in their binary representation. For example, using powers of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, ...) can help in setting as many bits as possible to 1 across the sequence.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The function summary and the implementation both indicate a flawed approach that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
