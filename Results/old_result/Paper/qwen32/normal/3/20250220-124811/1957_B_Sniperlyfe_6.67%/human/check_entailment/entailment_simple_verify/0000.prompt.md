You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: 
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns the list `nums` where the last element has been increased by `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. 

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 4
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- The numbers 1 and 4 sum up to 5.
- The bitwise OR of 1 and 4 is `1 | 4 = 5` which in binary is `101`, containing 2 ones.
- This is optimal because any other combination of two numbers that sum to 5 will not yield a bitwise OR with more than 2 ones.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3 2
```

Explanation of the actual output:
- The numbers 3 and 2 sum up to 5.
- The bitwise OR of 3 and 2 is `3 | 2 = 3` which in binary is `11`, containing 2 ones.
- While this output is correct in terms of the sum, it is not optimal because the program does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

However, let's consider another test case to highlight the issue more clearly:

**Input:**
```
1
2 10
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 8
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- The numbers 2 and 8 sum up to 10.
- The bitwise OR of 2 and 8 is `2 | 8 = 10` which in binary is `1010`, containing 2 ones.
- This is optimal because any other combination of two numbers that sum to 10 will not yield a bitwise OR with more than 2 ones.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
7 3
```

Explanation of the actual output:
- The numbers 7 and 3 sum up to 10.
- The bitwise OR of 7 and 3 is `7 | 3 = 7` which in binary is `111`, containing 3 ones.
- This output is correct and optimal in terms of the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

The problem is that the program does not consistently maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR for all cases. Specifically, the logic used in the program does not guarantee an optimal solution for every possible input. The program sets each number in the sequence to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` which is not always the optimal choice.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirement of maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR for every possible input.
