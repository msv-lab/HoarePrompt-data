To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `nums`, `k`, and `i`.

### Loop Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Given integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged by the loop).
   - `n`: Given integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (unchanged by the loop).
   - `k`: Given integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 (decreases with each iteration).
   - `nums`: A list of `n` zeros (gets updated with each iteration).

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - `nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`: This sets `nums[i]` to the largest number with the same bit length as `k` minus 1. For example, if `k` is 10 (bit length 4), `nums[i]` will be 7 (binary `0111`).
     - `k -= nums[i]`: This subtracts the value assigned to `nums[i]` from `k`.

### Final Output State
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: After `n` iterations, `k` will have been decremented by `n` times the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- **`nums`**: The first `n` elements of `nums` will each be set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the rest will remain 0 (though there are no more elements if `nums` has exactly `n` elements).

### Calculation of `k`
The value of `k` after `n` iterations can be calculated as:
\[ k_{\text{final}} = k - n \times \left((1 << k.bit\_length() - 1) - 1\right) \]

### Output State
The final output state is:
- `t`: Remains the same.
- `n`: Remains the same.
- `k`: Updated as described above.
- `nums`: First `n` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the rest are 0 (if any).

**Output State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, and `nums` is a list where the first `n` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `k` is reduced by `n` times the largest number with the same bit length as the initial `k` minus 1, and the first `n` elements of `nums` are all set to that largest number minus 1.
