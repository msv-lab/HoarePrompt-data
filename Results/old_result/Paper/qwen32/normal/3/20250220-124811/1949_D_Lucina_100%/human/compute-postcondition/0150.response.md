To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `j`, `1`, and `n + 1`. However, `1` is a constant and does not need adjustment. The variable `j` is the loop variable and gets assigned values automatically in each iteration from `1` to `n`. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

Given that `n` is already described as a positive integer, it should already satisfy the condition for the loop to execute. However, since `i` is initially set to `n`, we should ensure that `i` does not interfere with the loop's execution, but it is not part of the loop head and thus does not need adjustment for the loop to start.

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`**

Since the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to start. The state provided already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute.
