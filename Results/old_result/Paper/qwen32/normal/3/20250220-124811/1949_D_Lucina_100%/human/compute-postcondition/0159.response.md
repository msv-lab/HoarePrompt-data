Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` contains the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
