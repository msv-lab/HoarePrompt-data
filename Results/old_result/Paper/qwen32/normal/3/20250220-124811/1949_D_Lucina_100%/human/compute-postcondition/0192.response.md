The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`nx` is a string, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2**.
