Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to include the character at index 1 of `xx[n]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the substring `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.**
