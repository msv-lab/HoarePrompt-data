The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given the initial state, `a[j]` is either 3 or 1 (depending on whether `x[j - 1]` is 'F' or not). After the increment, `a[j]` will be either 4 or 2.

The values of other variables (`n`, `b`, `xx`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is 3 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', and 1 otherwise; `a[j]` is 4 if `a[j]` was 3, and 2 if `a[j]` was 1; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', and 0 otherwise; `xx` is a list containing a single empty string; `i` is 1; `x` is the input string; `j` is 2 if `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S'.**
