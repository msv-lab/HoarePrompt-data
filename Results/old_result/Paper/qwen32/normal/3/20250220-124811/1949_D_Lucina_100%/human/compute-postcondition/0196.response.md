Postcondition: **`nx` is a string with either 'F' or 'S' appended to it, depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`. `xx` remains a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`. `sa` remains a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2.**
