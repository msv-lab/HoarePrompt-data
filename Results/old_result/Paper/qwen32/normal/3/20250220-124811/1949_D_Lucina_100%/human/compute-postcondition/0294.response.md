Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a symmetric `n x n` matrix where each element is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with '.' only on the diagonal. It processes the matrix to replace '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column, ensuring that the number of 'F' and 'S' does not exceed `floor(n/2)`. The function then outputs the modified matrix.**
