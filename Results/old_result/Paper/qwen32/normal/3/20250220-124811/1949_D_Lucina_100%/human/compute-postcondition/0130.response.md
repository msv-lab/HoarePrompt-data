Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` plus any indices from `1` to `n` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa` before any potential appending of `i`, `nx` is an empty string, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**
