To determine what will be printed, we need to understand how the string `nx` is constructed based on the given conditions. However, the exact conditions for constructing `nx` are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Given the information provided, we can only describe the construction process and the final output in terms of these conditions.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: `nx` is initialized as an empty string.
2. **Iteration**: A loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
3. **Appending Characters**:
   - For each iteration, a character is appended to `nx`.
   - The character appended can be either from `xx[i]` or 'F'/'S', based on some unspecified condition.

Since the exact conditions are not provided, we can't determine the exact characters that will be appended to `nx`. However, we can describe the final output in terms of the constructed string `nx`.

### Final Output Description:
The string `nx` is constructed by appending characters based on certain conditions during the iteration from `j = 1` to `j = n`. The exact characters appended are not specified, but they are either from `xx[i]` or 'F'/'S'.

Therefore, the output will be the final constructed string `nx`.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed by appending characters from xx[i] or 'F'/'S' based on the given conditions)**
