Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is 4 (if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` was 'F'), or `a[1]` is 1 (if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` was neither 'F' nor 'S'), `a[2]` is `a[2] + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `i` is 1, `x` is the input string, and `j` is 2.**

In simple terms, the value of `a[2]` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
