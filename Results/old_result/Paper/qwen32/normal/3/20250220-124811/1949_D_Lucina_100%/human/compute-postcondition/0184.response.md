Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string, which is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the sublist `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise. `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`.***
