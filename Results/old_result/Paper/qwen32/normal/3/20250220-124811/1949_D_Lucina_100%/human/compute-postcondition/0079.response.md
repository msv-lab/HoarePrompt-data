The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `j + 1`, and `j` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1` and must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`x` is a string or a list, `j` is `j + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`**
