Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nx` is an empty string; `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`. If `xx[n][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If `xx[n][j - 1]` is '?', 'F' is appended if `n` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, 'S' is appended, `i` is `i + 1`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nx` is a string, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` contains the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the sublist `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nx` is a string, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is the original `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][0]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nx` is a string with an additional character appended to it. If `xx[i][1]` is not equal to '?', the appended character is `xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, the appended character is either 'F' or 'S', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`. `xx` remains a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`. `sa` remains a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
