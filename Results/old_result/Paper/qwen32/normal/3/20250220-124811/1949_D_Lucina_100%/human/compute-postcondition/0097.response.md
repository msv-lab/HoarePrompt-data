Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sa` is an empty list and `sb` is [1]. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain empty lists.**
