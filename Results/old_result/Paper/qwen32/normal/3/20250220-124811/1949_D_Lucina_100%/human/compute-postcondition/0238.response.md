To determine what will be printed when the `print(nx)` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `nx` is constructed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24.
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings.
- `i` is initialized to `n + 1`.
- `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, those indices are appended to `sb`.
- The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.
- `j` is initialized to `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions specified in the loop.

### Construction of `nx`:
The construction of `nx` involves a loop that iterates through the indices from `n` down to `1` (inclusive). For each index `i`:
- If `i` is in `sa`, append `xx[i]` to `nx`.
- If `i` is in `sb`, append 'S' to `nx`.
- If `i` is not in `sa` or `sb`, append 'F' to `nx`.

### Analysis:
- `sa` contains indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` contains indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and also indices where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- Given that the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, there are more indices in `sb` than in `sa`.

### Output Construction:
- The loop iterates from `n` to `1`, appending characters to `nx` based on the conditions.
- Since `sa` has fewer elements than `sb`, there will be more 'S' characters appended to `nx` compared to the number of elements from `xx` that are appended.
- If `i` is not in `sa` or `sb`, 'F' is appended, but the problem does not specify such indices, so we assume all indices are covered by `sa` or `sb`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the construction logic, `nx` will be a string composed primarily of characters from `xx` (for indices in `sa`) and 'S' (for indices in `sb`). The exact values depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`, but the structure is clear.

### Final Output:
Output: **nx (where nx is constructed by appending characters from xx[i] if i is in sa, 'S' if i is in sb, and 'F' if i is neither in sa nor sb, with the specific values depending on the input lists a and b)**

However, based on the problem statement and the given conditions, we can simplify this to:

Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed by appending characters from xx[i] for indices in sa and 'S' for indices in sb, with the exact values depending on the input lists a and b)**
