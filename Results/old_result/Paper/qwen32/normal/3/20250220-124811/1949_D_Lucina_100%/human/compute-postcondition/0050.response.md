Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[2]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position 2 in `x` increased by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[3]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position 3 in `x` increased by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[2]` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position 2 in `x` increased by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[3]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`, `i` is 2, `x` is the new input string, `j` is 3. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[2]` is incremented by 2 and `a[3]` by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[2]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1.**
