Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[1]` incremented by 1 and `b[2]` incremented by 1, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `i` is 1, `x` is the input string, and `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `b[j]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is 2, `b[2]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
