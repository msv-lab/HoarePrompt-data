Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[2]` is incremented by 3 and `a[3]` by 2, and `a[4]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[2]` and `a[3]` remain the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to positions 2 and 3 in `x`, respectively. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[2]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[2]` and `b[3]` remain the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to positions 2 and 3 in `x`, respectively. `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`. `i` is 2. `x` is the new input string. `j` is 4.**
