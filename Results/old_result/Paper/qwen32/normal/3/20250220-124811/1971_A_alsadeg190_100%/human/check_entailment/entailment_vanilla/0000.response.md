Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `x` times, corresponding to the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
4. It then checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic correctly identifies and prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case. The program adheres to the problem description by outputting the minimum followed by the maximum value for each pair of integers.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
