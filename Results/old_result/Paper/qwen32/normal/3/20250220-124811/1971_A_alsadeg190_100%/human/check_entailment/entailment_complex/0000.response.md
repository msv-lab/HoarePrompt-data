Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times.
3. For each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
4. It checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
5. If `x` is not less than `y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic ensures that for each pair of integers `x` and `y`, the smaller number is printed first, followed by the larger number, which is exactly what the problem statement requires. The program also handles the constraints correctly, as it processes up to 100 test cases, and each integer `x` and `y` is within the range 0 to 9.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
