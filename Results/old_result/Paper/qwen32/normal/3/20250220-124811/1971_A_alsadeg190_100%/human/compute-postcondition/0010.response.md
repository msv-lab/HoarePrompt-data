Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `x` is an integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but `i` is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(x, y)
```
This statement will print the current values of `x` and `y`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified other than their ranges, we can't provide specific numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables `x` and `y`.

Output: **x, y (where x is an integer greater than 0 and y is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
