To determine the output of the `print(y, x)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This variable does not affect the `print(y, x)` statement directly.
2. `x` is an integer provided by the input, and it is greater than 0.
3. `y` is an integer provided by the input, and it is between 0 and 9 inclusive.
4. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. However, `i` is not used in the `print(y, x)` statement.

Given the above, the `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` in that order. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **y, x (where y is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and x is an integer greater than 0)**
