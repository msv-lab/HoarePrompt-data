Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `i` is `i + 1`. Regardless of whether `x < y` or not, `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` retain their values as described, with `i` incremented by 1.**
