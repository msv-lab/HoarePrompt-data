The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` and `y` are integers with `x` being greater than 0 and `y` between 0 and 9, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the code snippet does not affect `t` or `i`. The new values of `x` and `y` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `t` and the incremented value of `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the input, with `x` being greater than 0 and `y` being between 0 and 9.
