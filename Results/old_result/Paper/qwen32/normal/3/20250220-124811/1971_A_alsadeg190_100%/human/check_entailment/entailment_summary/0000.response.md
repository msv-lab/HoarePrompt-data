Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it prints the smaller integer followed by the larger one. This is achieved using a simple if-else condition to compare `x` and `y` and print them in the correct order.

The program's behavior aligns with the expected output for the given example. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
