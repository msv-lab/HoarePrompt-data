Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers, `x` and `y`. It then correctly prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers in the required format. The logic used in the program is straightforward and covers all possible cases where `x` and `y` are within the specified range (0 to 9). The program handles scenarios where `x` is less than `y`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is equal to `y` (as seen in the provided example). Therefore, the program meets the problem description for every potential case.
