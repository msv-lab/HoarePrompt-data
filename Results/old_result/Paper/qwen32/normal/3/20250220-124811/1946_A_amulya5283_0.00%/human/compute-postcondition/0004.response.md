The code calculates the `median_index` as `n // 2`. This means `median_index` is the integer division of `n` by 2. Given that `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, the value of `median_index` will be half of `n` (rounded down if `n` is odd).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
