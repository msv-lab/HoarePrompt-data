The code sorts the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` now contains the integers from the `i`-th test case in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order.**
