Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1; `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with one element removed and now includes the element `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element removed from the heap; `heap[0]` is the new smallest element in the heap and must be less than or equal to `current_median`.**

In simple terms, the variable `operations` has been incremented by 1, making its value 3. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
