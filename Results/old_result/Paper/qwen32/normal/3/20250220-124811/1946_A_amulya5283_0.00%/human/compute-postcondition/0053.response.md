To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the relevant variables:

1. **`heap[0]`**: This is the smallest element in the heap, which is a heapified version of the second half of the sorted array `arr` starting from the `median_index`.
2. **`current_median`**: This is the median of the array `arr`, which is the element at the `median_index` position in the sorted array `arr`.

For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Analysis:
- **`arr`**: Since `arr` is sorted, `current_median` is the middle element of `arr`. If `n` (the length of `arr`) is odd, `current_median` is the element at index `n // 2`. If `n` is even, `current_median` is the element at index `n // 2` (the lower middle element).
- **`heap`**: The heap is formed from the second half of `arr` starting from `median_index`. Therefore, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in this second half.

### Condition for the Loop to Execute:
- `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Given that `heap` is a heapified version of the second half of `arr`, the smallest element in this heap (`heap[0]`) should be less than or equal to `current_median` for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments:
- Since `arr` is sorted, the median (`current_median`) is already in the correct position.
- The heap is formed from the second half of `arr`, so `heap[0]` should naturally be less than or equal to `current_median` if `arr` is properly sorted and `heap` is correctly heapified.
- No specific adjustment is needed to `heap[0]` or `current_median` if they are derived correctly from `arr`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `arr` is sorted and `heap` is heapified from the second half of `arr`, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` should naturally hold true. Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed to the state of `heap[0]` or `current_median`.

Thus, the state right before the loop can be repeated as is, since the condition for the loop to execute is inherently satisfied by the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is 0**
