Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of operations performed.**

Explanation: The array `arr` has been sorted. All other variables remain unchanged. The `median_index` and `current_median` are recalculated based on the sorted `arr`. The `heap` is still a heapified version of the second half of the sorted `arr`.
