The provided code snippet pushes `smallest + 1` into the heap. This modifies the `heap` by adding a new element, which is `smallest + 1`. No other variables in the initial state are directly modified by this operation.

Given the initial state, the heap is heapified from `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, and `smallest` is the smallest element from this heap before it was removed. After pushing `smallest + 1` into the heap, the heap will now include this new value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 0, `smallest` is the smallest element from the original `heap` before it was removed.**
