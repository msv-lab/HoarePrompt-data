Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is `True`.**

Explanation: The variable `not_c` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`arr`, `A`, and `set_`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
