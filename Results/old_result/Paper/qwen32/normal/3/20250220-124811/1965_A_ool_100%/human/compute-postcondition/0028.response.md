To determine the output state, we need to consider the value of `A` after the potential flip based on the value of `not_c`. Here's the breakdown:

1. If `not_c` is `True`, `A` is flipped. So, if `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`.
2. If `not_c` is `False`, `A` remains unchanged.

The return statement then checks the value of `A`:
- If `A` is `True`, it returns `'Alice'`.
- If `A` is `False`, it returns `'Bob'`.

Let's consider both possible scenarios:

1. If `not_c` is `True`:
   - If `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`, so the return value is `'Bob'`.
   - If `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`, so the return value is `'Alice'`.

2. If `not_c` is `False`:
   - If `A` was `True`, it remains `True`, so the return value is `'Alice'`.
   - If `A` was `False`, it remains `False`, so the return value is `'Bob'`.

Given these scenarios, the program will return either `'Alice'` or `'Bob'` based on the initial value of `A` and the value of `not_c`.

Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the value of A after it may have been flipped by not_c.**
