### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the unique stone counts across all test cases. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not correctly reflect the rules and winning strategy of the game described.

The game is essentially a variant of Nim where players remove the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game can be reduced to a problem of Nim-sum (XOR of pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, they are in a winning position.

The provided code does not compute the Nim-sum. Instead, it checks if the smallest pile size is not 1 and looks for gaps in the sorted unique pile sizes. This approach does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.

### Correctness:

Given the explanation above, the provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the described rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
