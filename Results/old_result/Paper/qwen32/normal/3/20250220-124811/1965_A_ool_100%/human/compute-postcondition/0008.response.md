Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and the second element of `set_` is any integer greater than 1; `not_c` is `True`. Additionally, the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `set_` is greater than 1.**
