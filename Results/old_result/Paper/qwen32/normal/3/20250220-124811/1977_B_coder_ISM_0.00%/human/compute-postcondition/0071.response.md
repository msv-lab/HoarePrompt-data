The code snippet changes the value of `s[i - 1]` from '1' to '-1'. The other elements of the sequence `s` and the variable `length` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence where the current element `s[i]` is '0' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is '-1'.**
