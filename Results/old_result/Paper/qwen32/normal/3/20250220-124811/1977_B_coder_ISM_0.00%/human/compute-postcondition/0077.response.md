The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `length` is greater than 1
- `s` is a sequence
- `i` is incremented by 1

The loop condition is `for i in range(1, length)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `length`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `length`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1** (which means `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1)

Since only `i` is adjusted in the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1** (adjusting `i` to the next value in the range)

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it would now be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the state should reflect that `i` has been incremented again.

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1** (implying `i` is now `x + 2` if it was `x` at the end of the previous iteration)

However, since we are only adjusting based on the loop head variables and the problem statement specifies incrementing `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration, we can simplify this to:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1** (reflecting the next value in the loop)

For clarity, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1** (implying `i` is now `x + 1`)

Simplified final state considering only the loop head variables:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is the next value in the range** (which is `i + 1` from the previous iteration)

So the final answer is:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1** (reflecting the start of the next iteration)

To be explicit about the value of `i`:

If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1** (implying `i` is now `x + 1`)

Simplified to:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is the next value in the range**

Final Answer:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1**
