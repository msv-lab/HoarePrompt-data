Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1', '1'] or ['0', '0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`. If the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, `s` contains an additional '1'; otherwise, `s` contains an additional '0'.**
