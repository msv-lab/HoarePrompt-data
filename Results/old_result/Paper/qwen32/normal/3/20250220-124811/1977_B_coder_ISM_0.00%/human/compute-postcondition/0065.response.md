The code snippet `length += 1` increments the value of the variable `length` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `flag`, `s[29]`, and the additional element `'1'` at the end of `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables, `flag` is `True`, `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` includes an additional element `'1'` at the end, and `length` is incremented by 1.**
