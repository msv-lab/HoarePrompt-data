The code snippet `length = 30` directly assigns the value `30` to the variable `length`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **The list `s` is an empty list; `length` is 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `flag` remains 1 or 0 depending on the conditions described; `x` is an input integer.**
