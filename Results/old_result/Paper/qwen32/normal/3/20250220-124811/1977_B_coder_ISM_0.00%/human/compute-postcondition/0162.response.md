The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the element at index `i - 1` in the string `s`. Given that `i` is 3, the element at index `2` (which is `i - 1`) is set to `'-1'`. The initial state specifies that `s[3]` is `'0'`, which means the element at index `3` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`length` is 30 or 31, `i` is 3, `s[2]` is `'-1'`, `s[3]` is `'0'`**.
