The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value, which is `30`. Since the range value is constant and does not change, we only need to adjust the variable `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`.

State: **`s` is either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on whether the least significant bit of `x` is not zero or zero, respectively. `length` is `30`, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `i` is `1`.**
