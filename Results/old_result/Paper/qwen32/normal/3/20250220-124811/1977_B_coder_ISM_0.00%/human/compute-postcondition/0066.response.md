Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables. If `flag` is `True`, then `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` includes an additional element `'1'` at the end, and `length` is incremented by 1. If `flag` is `False`, then `s[29]` is not equal to `'0'` and no changes are made to `s` or `length`.**
