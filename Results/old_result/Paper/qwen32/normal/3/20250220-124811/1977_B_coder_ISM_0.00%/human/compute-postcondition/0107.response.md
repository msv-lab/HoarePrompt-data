The value of `s[i]` is changed from '0' to '1'. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **the list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0', with `s[i]` now specifically '1'; `length` is 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30; `flag` is 1**.
