The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i` of the list `s` to the string `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 1, the second element of the list `s` is changed to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where the first element is either '1', '0', or '-1' and the second element is now '-1'; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 1.**
