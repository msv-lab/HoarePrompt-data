Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not, except in the case where `flag` was 0 and `s[0]` and `s[1]` were both '1', in which case `s[0]` is set to '-1'; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1, and if `flag` was 0 and `s[0]` and `s[1]` were both '1', `flag` is set to 1; `i` is 0.**
