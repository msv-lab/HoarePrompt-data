The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `30`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `30`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to 5. The states of `length`, `x`, and `s` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`length` is 30, `x` is an integer, `i` is 5, `s` has a new element appended to it. If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1, `s` has '1' appended; otherwise, `s` has '0' appended.**
