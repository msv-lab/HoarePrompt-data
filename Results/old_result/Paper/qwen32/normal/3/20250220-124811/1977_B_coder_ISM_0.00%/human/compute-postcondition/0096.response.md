Output State: **`s` is either `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']` depending on whether the least significant bit of `x` is not zero or zero, respectively; `length` is `30`; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is `1`.**

Natural language: The list `s` now contains an additional element `'0'` appended to it, so it is either `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']` based on the initial value. The values of `length`, `t`, `nalla`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `s` which has been updated.
