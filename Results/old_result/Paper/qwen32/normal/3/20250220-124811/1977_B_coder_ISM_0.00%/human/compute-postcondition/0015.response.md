The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `30`. Therefore, we only need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop iterates over a range of 30.

To execute one more iteration, `i` must be less than 30 at the start of the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous state.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it more clear, if `i` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 6. So, we need to adjust `i` to be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we are only adjusting `i` and `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**.
