Output State: **the list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x` with the least significant bit at the start of the list. The variable `length` remains `30`, `t` remains unchanged, and `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `s` will have 30 elements, each corresponding to a bit in the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit. The variables `length`, `t`, and `nalla` will be as described.
