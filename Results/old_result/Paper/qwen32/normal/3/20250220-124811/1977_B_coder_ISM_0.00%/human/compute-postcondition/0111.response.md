Output State: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, where `s[i]` is now '-1' and `s[i + 1]` is '1'. `length` is 30. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30. `flag` is 0.**

In natural language: The element at index `i` in the list `s` has been changed to '-1', while the element at index `i + 1` remains '1'. All other elements in the list `s` and the values of `length`, `t`, `nalla`, and `flag` remain unchanged.
