Postcondition: **`length` is either 30 or 31, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 28, `s` is a list of characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's, and `flag` is either 0 or 1. Specifically, if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[29]` was '0', then `s[29]` is now '1' and `length` remains 30. If `flag` was not 1 or `s[29]` was not '0', then `length` is 31, `s` has an additional character '1' at the 31st position with the 30th character being '0', and `flag` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
