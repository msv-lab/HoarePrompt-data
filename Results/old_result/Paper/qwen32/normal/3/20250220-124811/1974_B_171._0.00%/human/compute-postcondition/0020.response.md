The code snippet `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value `c` to the `decoded` list. The other variables (`encoded`, `mapping`, `char`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` is a list containing one additional element `chr(c)`, and `char` is in `mapping`.**
