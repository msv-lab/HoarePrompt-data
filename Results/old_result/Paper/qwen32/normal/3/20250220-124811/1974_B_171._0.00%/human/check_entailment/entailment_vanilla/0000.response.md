Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of decoding the encoded string as described.

### Problem Recap
1. **Encoding Process**:
   - Construct a string `r` from the distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - Given an encoded string `b`, we need to reconstruct the original string `s`.
   - To do this, we need to reverse the encoding process: map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s`.

### Key Points to Consider
- **Distinct Characters**: The string `r` consists of distinct characters from `s` in alphabetical order.
- **Symmetric Mapping**: Each character in `s` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
- **Decoding Logic**: To decode, we need to map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` using the symmetric mapping.

### Analysis of the Given Program

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Mapping Initialization**: A dictionary `mapping` is initialized to store the mapping from characters in `r` to characters in `b`.
   - **Decoding Process**:
     - For each character in `b`:
       - If the character is already in `mapping`, it appends the corresponding original character to `decoded`.
       - If the character is not in `mapping`, it tries to find the next available character (from 'a' to 'z') that is not already a value in `mapping` and maps it to the current character in `b`. It then appends this character to `decoded`.

### Flaws in the Program
- **Incorrect Mapping Logic**:
  - The program does not construct the string `r` from the distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
  - It does not map characters in `b` back to their symmetric counterparts in `r`.
  - Instead, it attempts to map characters in `b` to the next available character ('a' to 'z') that is not already used, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach
- **Construct `r`**: Extract distinct characters from `b` and sort them to form `r`.
- **Create Symmetric Mapping**: For each character in `r`, map it to its symmetric counterpart.
- **Decode `b`**: Use the symmetric mapping to convert each character in `b` back to its original character in `s`.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
