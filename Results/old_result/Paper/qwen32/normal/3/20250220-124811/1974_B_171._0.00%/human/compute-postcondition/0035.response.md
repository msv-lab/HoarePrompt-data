Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'c'` and the value is `char`; `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` if `chr(c)` was not initially in the values of `mapping`, otherwise `mapping` and `decoded` remain unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, or `decoded`. It only indicates that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
