The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no impact on the variables `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, or `c`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with `'b'` as a key and `char` as its value; `decoded` remains an empty list; `char` remains the same; `c` is `ord('b')`.**
