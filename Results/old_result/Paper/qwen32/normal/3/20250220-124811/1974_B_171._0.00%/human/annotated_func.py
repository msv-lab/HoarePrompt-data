#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called once for each encoded string in t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the total length of all encoded strings does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'. `decoded` is a list of the same length as `encoded`, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `mapping`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining all the characters in the list `decoded`. This string represents the decoded version of the original `encoded` string, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. Each unique character in the `encoded` string is mapped to a unique lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', and the function replaces each character in `encoded` with its corresponding mapped value to produce the decoded string.
