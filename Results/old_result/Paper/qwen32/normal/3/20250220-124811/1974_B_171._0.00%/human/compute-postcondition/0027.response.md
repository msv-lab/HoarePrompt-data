The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `chr(c)` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`, `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` is not in `mapping` and `'a'` is added to `mapping` with `char` as its value, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.**
