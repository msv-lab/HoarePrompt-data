Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to decode the encoded string by creating a mapping from each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'. However, the logic used in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The program does not construct the auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the encoded string in alphabetical order, nor does it correctly map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in `r`.

The program's approach is flawed because it doesn't take into account the specific encoding process described in the problem statement. The program simply assigns the next available character from 'a' to 'z' to each character in the encoded string if it hasn't been assigned yet, which does not guarantee that the decoding will be correct according to the described encoding algorithm.

For example, consider the encoded string "serofedsoc" from the problem statement. The correct decoding process involves:
1. Identifying the distinct characters in the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically to form `r`: "cdefors".
2. Mapping each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in `r`:
   - 's' -> 'c'
   - 'e' -> 'o'
   - 'r' -> 'd'
   - 'o' -> 'e'
   - 'f' -> 'f'
   - 'e' -> 'o'
   - 'd' -> 'r'
   - 's' -> 'c'
   - 'o' -> 'e'
   - 'c' -> 's'
3. The decoded string is "codeforces".

The provided program does not follow this process and will not produce the correct decoded string.

Correctness: **False**
