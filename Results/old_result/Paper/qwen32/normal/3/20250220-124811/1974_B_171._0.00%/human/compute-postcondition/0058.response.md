Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'. `decoded` is a list of the same length as `encoded`, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `mapping`.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has finished executing for all characters in `encoded`, `mapping` will contain a unique mapping for each distinct character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'. The `decoded` list will have the same length as `encoded`, with each character in `encoded` replaced by its mapped value from `mapping`.
