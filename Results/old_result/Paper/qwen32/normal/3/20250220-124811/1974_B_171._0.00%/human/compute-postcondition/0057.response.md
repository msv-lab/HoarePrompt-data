Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, and if `char` is not already in `mapping`, a new key-value pair `'x': char` is added where `'x'` is the first lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' not already in `mapping.values()`. `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules and now includes either `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the new character `chr(c)` if `char` is not in `mapping`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**
