The code assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the `mapping` dictionary. Since `c` is initialized to 97, `chr(c)` is `'a'`. Therefore, `mapping` will have `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules, `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string, `c` is 97 (ord('a'))**.
