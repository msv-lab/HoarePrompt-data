The provided code snippet converts the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from their initial state (which is described as being read from input) into integers. This conversion does not affect any other variables or their states, as the code does not modify `t`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first input integer converted to an integer; `k` is the second input integer converted to an integer; `pb` is the third input integer converted to an integer; `ps` is the fourth input integer converted to an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, where `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`; `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` remains the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations. Otherwise, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations.**
