The code snippet provided is:
```python
pres += paths[i]
```

This line of code adds the value at index `i` of the list `paths` to the variable `pres`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `pres`, which now includes the addition of `paths[i]` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integer values from input, `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates, `ps` is the repeated node, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the loop or the most internal block is exited, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

In simple terms, the value of `pres` is updated to be its previous value plus the value of `paths[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
