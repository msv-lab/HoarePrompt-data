For the given task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop. This means that the loop will execute at least once regardless of the initial state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute its first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is an empty list; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
