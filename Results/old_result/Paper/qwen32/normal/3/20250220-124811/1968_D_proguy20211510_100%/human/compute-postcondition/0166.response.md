Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integer values from input, `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates, `ps` is the repeated node, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is 0, `i` is the smaller of `len(pathb)` and `k`, and `k` is less than `i + 1`. The loop or the most internal block is exited.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop or the most internal block of code is exited.
