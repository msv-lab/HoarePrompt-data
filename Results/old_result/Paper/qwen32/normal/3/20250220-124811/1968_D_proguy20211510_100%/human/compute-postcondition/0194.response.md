The provided code snippet reads four space-separated values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Given the initial state, these variables were already defined, but their values were not specified. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` will be updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `pb` is the third input integer, `ps` is the fourth input integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, where `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`; `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` remains the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations. Otherwise, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations.**

In simpler terms, the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` now hold the values read from the input, while all other variables retain their initial states.
