The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the length of `pathb`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `pathb`.

Given that `i` is currently `i + 1` from the previous iteration, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, which was `i` at the start of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`**
