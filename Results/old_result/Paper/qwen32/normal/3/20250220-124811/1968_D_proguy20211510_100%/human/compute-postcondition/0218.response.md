The code snippet `vis = [0] * n` initializes the `vis` list with `n` zeros, effectively resetting the `vis` list to have all elements set to 0. This means that all nodes are now marked as unvisited.

Output State: **`pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, and `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`.**
