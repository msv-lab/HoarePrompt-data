Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integer values from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates; `ps` is the repeated node; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations; `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations; `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`. Additionally, `resb` is greater than `ress`.**
