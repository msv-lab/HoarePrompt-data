Postcondition: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` remains the same, `i` is `i`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `ps` remains the same, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
