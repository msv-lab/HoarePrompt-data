Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`**

In simple terms, the value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `preb`, `pathb`, `curr`) retain their previous definitions and values.
