Postcondition: **`pathb`, `pb`, `vis`, `preb`, `resb`, `paths`, `ps` remain the same. `ress` is the maximum `curr` value computed during the iterations. `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`. `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. If `ress` is greater than `resb`, then `resb` remains the same. Otherwise, `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.**
