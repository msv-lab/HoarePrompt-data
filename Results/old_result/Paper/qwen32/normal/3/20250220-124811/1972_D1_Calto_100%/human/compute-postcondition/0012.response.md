The code updates the value of `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` to it. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` are derived from the initial state but are not directly modified by this snippet. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `cnt`.

Given:
- `x = n - (i * i - i)`
- `y = (i + 2) * (i + 2)`
- `i` is updated elsewhere but not in this snippet

The expression `math.ceil(x / y)` calculates the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`, and `(x % y == 0)` evaluates to `1` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), and `0` otherwise.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / ((i + 2) * (i + 2))) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % ((i + 2) * (i + 2)) == 0)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`; `i` is `i + 2`.**

In simple terms, `cnt` is incremented by the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y` plus `1` if `x` is divisible by `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain as per their definitions in the initial state.
