The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `m` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
- `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1, making it `i + 2` from the initial value at the start of the previous iteration.

The states `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 2`**
