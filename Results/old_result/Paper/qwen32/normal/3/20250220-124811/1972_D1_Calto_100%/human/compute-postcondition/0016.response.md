Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`, and returns a count `cnt` which is calculated based on a summation involving the ceiling of a division and a condition check for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. Specifically, for each `i`, it computes a value and accumulates it into `cnt`, which is then adjusted by subtracting 1 from the total sum.**
