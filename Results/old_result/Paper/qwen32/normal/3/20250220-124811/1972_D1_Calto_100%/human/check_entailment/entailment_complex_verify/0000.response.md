### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: Computes the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

#### Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
- This function correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- The annotations confirm that it returns the GCD of the initial `a` and `b`.

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is incorrect because the count should start from 0.
- It iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The logic in `func_2(n, m)` is flawed because:
- The formula used to compute `x` and `y` does not align with the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The annotations confirm that the function is calculating a sum involving ceiling and modulo operations, but this does not match the problem's requirement.

To correctly count the valid pairs, the program should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided logic does not follow this approach.

### Example of Incorrectness:
For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the correct number of pairs is 3, as the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2). However, the provided function will not yield this result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem description. The logic in `func_2(n, m)` is flawed and does not align with the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
