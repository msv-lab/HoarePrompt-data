### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is correct.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

The function summary provided for `func_2` does not seem to align with the logic needed to solve the problem. Let's examine the logic in `func_2` in detail:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

- `cnt` is initialized to -1, which is incorrect as the count should start from 0.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The logic here does not match the problem's requirement. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly implemented. Instead of iterating over possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition, the function uses a different formula that does not align with the problem statement.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2_correct(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem description. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not align with the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
