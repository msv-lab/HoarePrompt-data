Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) / ((i + 1) * (i + 1))) + ((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) % ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) == 0); `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`, while the values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `y`, and `i` remain as described in the initial state with `i` having been incremented by 1 in the previous statement.
