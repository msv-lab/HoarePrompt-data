Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the number of valid pairs for each test case.

The condition given in the problem is that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the provided `func_2` function does not check this condition. Instead, it performs some unrelated calculations that do not correspond to the problem's requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate gcd
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        m = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the line below to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected program defines a function `count_valid_pairs` that iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if they satisfy the condition `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. It then collects the results for each test case and prints them. Note that this solution may not be efficient enough for very large inputs due to its O(n * m) complexity, but it correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.
