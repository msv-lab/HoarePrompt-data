### Reasoning:

The given problem is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

Let's analyze `func_2(n, m)` more closely. The function iterates through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition. The formula used inside the loop seems to be an attempt to count the valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

However, the formula inside the loop is incorrect for the problem at hand. The formula `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` does not correctly count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

Given the incorrect formula, the program will not produce the correct results for the problem described.
