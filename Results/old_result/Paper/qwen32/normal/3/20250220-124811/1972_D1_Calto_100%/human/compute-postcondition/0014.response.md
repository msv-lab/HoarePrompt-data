Output State: **The program returns `cnt` which is updated to `-1 + sum(math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0) for i in range(1, m + 1))`**

This means `cnt` is calculated based on the provided formula, which involves iterating from 1 to `m`, performing some arithmetic operations, and summing up the results. The final value of `cnt` is then returned by the program.
