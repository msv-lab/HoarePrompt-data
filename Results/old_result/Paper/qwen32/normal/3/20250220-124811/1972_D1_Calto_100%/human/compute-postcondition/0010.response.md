The given code snippet updates the value of `x` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. The other variables `m`, `cnt`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged in this code snippet.

Here's the updated value for `x`:
- `x` is now `n - (i * i - i)`.

The other variables retain their previous states:
- `n` and `m` are still positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `cnt` is still updated as per its previous definition.
- `y` is still `i * i`.
- `i` is still `i + 2` (though this value of `i` is used in the calculation of `x`).

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 2`.**
