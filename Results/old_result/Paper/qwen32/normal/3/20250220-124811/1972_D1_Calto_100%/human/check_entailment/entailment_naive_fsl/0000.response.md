Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: Computes the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.

### Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
This function correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the code is correct.

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`:
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. However, the logic in this function does not seem to match the problem description.

Let's break down the logic in `func_2(n, m)`:
- `cnt` is initialized to -1.
- It iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The provided logic does not seem to correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b). The logic appears to be incorrect because:
- The formula used to compute `x` and `y` does not align with the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The initialization of `cnt` to -1 is incorrect since the count should start from 0.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem description. The logic in `func_2(n, m)` is flawed.

### Example of Incorrectness:
For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the correct number of pairs is 3, as the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2). However, the provided function will not yield this result.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The logic in `func_2(n, m)` is incorrect and does not align with the problem description.
