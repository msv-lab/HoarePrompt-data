### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: Computes the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

##### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
This function correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the code is correct.

##### Function `func_2(n, m)`:
The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`. However, the logic in this function does not seem to match the problem description.

Let's break down the logic in `func_2(n, m)`:
- `cnt` is initialized to -1.
- It iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The provided logic does not seem to correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The logic appears to be incorrect because:
- The formula used to compute `x` and `y` does not align with the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The initialization of `cnt` to -1 is incorrect since the count should start from 0.

#### Analysis Using Annotations:
The annotations in the annotated code provide the state of the program at key points, but they don't change the fact that the logic in `func_2(n, m)` does not align with the problem description.

#### Verification with Example:
For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the correct number of pairs is 3, as the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), and \((2,2)\). However, the provided function will not yield this result.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem description. The logic in `func_2(n, m)` is flawed.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. The logic in `func_2(n, m)` is incorrect and does not align with the problem description.
