### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem statement and the given functions.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function correctly returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The logic inside `func_2` appears to be incorrect based on the problem description. The formula used inside the loop does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). A naive approach would be:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

However, this approach is not efficient enough for the given constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)).

A more efficient approach involves mathematical insights to reduce the number of iterations. The given function `func_2` does not seem to implement such insights correctly.

#### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
