To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's revisit the problem requirements and analyze the functions `func_1` and `func_2` in detail.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and can be used to find the GCD of two numbers.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The purpose of this function is to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The implementation of `func_2` is provided as follows:
     ```python
     def func_2(n, m):
         cnt = -1
         for i in range(1, m + 1):
             x = n - (i * i - i)
             y = i * i
             cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
         return cnt
     ```
   - The logic in this function does not align with the problem's requirements. Here's why:
     - The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is unusual and likely incorrect.
     - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but the variables `x` and `y` are computed in a way that does not directly relate to the problem's conditions.
     - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not correspond to any logical step in determining whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The increment `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the function `func_2` as provided does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in `func_2` does not align with the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
