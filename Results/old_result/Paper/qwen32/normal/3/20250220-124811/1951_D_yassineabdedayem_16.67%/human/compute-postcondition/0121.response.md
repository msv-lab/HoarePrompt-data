The code snippet reassigns the variables `Min` and `Max` based on the minimum and maximum values between `n // k` and `k`. Since the initial state already defines `Min` and `Max` in the same manner, the reassignment does not change their values.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is `1`, `tab` is `['number']`, `number` is either `1` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

In simpler terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state because the reassignment of `Min` and `Max` does not alter their values.
