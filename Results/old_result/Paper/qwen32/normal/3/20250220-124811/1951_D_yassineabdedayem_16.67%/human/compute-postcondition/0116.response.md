Postcondition: **`t` is `t`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is either `0` or `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is either `1` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `0` and `number` is `1`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` and `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.
