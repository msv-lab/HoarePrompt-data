The given initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`), but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Let's break it down:
- `t` is described as `t-1`, which means `t` is one less than some previous value of `t`, but we don't need this information for the `print` statement.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is not 0, but it's not used in the `print` statement.
- `rep` is 3, but it's not used in the `print` statement.
- `tab` is a list containing the strings `'3'`, `'2'`, and `'1'`, but it's not used in the `print` statement.
- `number` is 1, but it's not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('NO')`, it will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **NO**
