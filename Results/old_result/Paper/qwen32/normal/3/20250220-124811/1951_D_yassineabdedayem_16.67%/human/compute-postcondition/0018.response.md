To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the conditions in the `while` loop are met. The loop condition is:

```
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **`n != 0`**: This means `n` should not be zero.
2. **`k > 0`**: This means `k` should be a positive integer.
3. **`rep < 60`**: This means `rep` should be less than 60.
4. **`n >= k`**: This means `n` should be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (This does not affect the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust it).
- `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n = n - Min * Max` (We need to ensure `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`).
- `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n (We need to ensure `k` is positive and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`).
- `rep` is 1 (We need to ensure `rep` is less than 60).
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` (This does not affect the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust it).
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` (This does not affect the loop condition directly, so we don't need to adjust it).

Since `rep` is 1, it is already less than 60, so we don't need to adjust `rep`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `k` such that `n` is non-zero, `k` is positive, and `n >= k`.

Since `k` is already a positive integer and `n` is a non-zero integer, we just need to ensure that `n >= k`. Given the state, we can adjust `n` to be at least `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k)**
