The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `Max` from it. 

Given:
- `k` is initially `k - min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`

After the execution of `k = k - Max`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(n // k, k) - max(int(n / k), k)`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k) - max(int(n / k), k)`, `rep` is `1`, `tab` is `['number']`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**
