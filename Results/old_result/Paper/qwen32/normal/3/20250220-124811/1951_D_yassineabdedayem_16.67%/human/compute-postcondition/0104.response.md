The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged. The specific values of `n` and `k` depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `rep` is 3, `tab` is ['3', '2', '1'] if `k` is not 0, otherwise `tab` is ['3', '2', '1', 'new_element'], `number` is 1**.
