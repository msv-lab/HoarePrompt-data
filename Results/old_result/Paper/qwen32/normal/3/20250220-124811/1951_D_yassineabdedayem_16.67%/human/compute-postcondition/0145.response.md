Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t` (the value of `t` is not explicitly provided, so we don't know its value).
- `n` is 0 or less than `k` (the exact value of `n` is not specified, but we know it is 0 or less than `k`).
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60).
- `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers with at least one element.
- `number` is the last number calculated.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is attempting to print the value of the variable `i` followed by a space, without a newline at the end (`end=' '`).

### Key Points:
- The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, which means we do not have any information about its value or how it is defined or calculated.
- Since `i` is not defined in the given information, we cannot determine its exact value.

### Conclusion:
Given that the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine exactly what will be printed. However, based on the provided information, the print statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
