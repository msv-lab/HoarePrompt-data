To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and identify the value or state of the variable `i` at the point of execution.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop (up to 60).
- `tab` is `["1", "2"]`.

### Key Observations:
- Since `k` is 0, `n` must be 0 (as `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`).
- `rep` indicates the number of iterations, but it does not directly impact the value of `i` unless `i` is defined within a loop that runs `rep` times.
- `tab` is a list of strings `["1", "2"]`, but it does not directly impact the value of `i`.

### Identifying `i`:
The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is provided, we can infer that `i` must be defined somewhere in the code that is not shown here. Given the context, it's likely that `i` is a loop counter.

### Reasoning:
- If `i` is a loop counter, it will take on the values from 0 up to `rep - 1` (assuming a typical `for i in range(rep)` loop).
- Since `rep` can be up to 60, `i` can take on values from 0 to 59.
- However, without the exact loop structure, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` at the point of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the information provided, we can infer that `i` is likely a loop counter, and its value depends on the iteration of the loop at the point of the `print` statement. We cannot determine a specific value for `i` without more context, but we can describe it in terms of its possible range.

Output: **i (where i is a loop counter taking values from 0 to 59 depending on the iteration of the loop)**
