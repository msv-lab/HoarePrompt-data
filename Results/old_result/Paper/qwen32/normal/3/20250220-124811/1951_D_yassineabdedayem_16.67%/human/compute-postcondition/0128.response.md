The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` directly modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `n` was initially defined as `n - Min * Max`. After the code executes, `n` is further reduced by `Min * Max`.

If we denote the initial value of `n` before the code snippet as `n_initial`, then:
- Initially, `n = n_initial - Min * Max`
- After executing `n -= Min * Max`, `n` becomes `n_initial - Min * Max - Min * Max`, which simplifies to `n_initial - 2 * Min * Max`.

However, since the initial state already defined `n` as `n - Min * Max`, we can infer that the new value of `n` is effectively `n - Min * Max - Min * Max` from its initial definition, which means `n` is now `n - 2 * Min * Max`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - 2 * Min * Max`, `rep` is `1`, `tab` is `['number', str(number)]`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `k - Min - Max` and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 2 * Min` and `number` is `Max`.**
