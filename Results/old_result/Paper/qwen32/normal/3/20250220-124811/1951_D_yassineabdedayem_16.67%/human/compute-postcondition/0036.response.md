The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` updates the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values are directly dependent on `n`, which is not the case here. Therefore, the updated value of `n` will be `n - Min * Max`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n - Min * Max` > 0 and `n - Min * Max` >= `k`; `k` is updated based on the condition: if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is set to `k - max(int(n / k), k)`, otherwise `k` is set to `k - Min`; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` three times; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is set to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is set to `Max`. `n` is now `n - Min * Max`.**
