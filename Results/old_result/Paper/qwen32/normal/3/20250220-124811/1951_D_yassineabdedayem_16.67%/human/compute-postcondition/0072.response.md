Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `k` is 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is 1, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 0 because `k` was originally 2 and `Max` is 2, so `k - Max` results in 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
