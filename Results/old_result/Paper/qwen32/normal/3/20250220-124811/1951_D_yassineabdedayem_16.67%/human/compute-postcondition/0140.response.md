To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` with each iteration. The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop as described after 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t`
   - `n` is the first integer from the input
   - `k` is the second integer from the input
   - `rep` is `0`
   - `tab` is `[]`
   - `number` is `0`

2. **Loop Iterations:**
   - Each iteration reduces `n` by `Min * Max` and adjusts `k` by subtracting either `Min` or `Max` based on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`.
   - `tab` appends the string representation of `number` in each iteration.
   - `rep` increments by `1` in each iteration.

3. **Termination Condition:**
   - The loop terminates when any of the following conditions are met:
     - `n == 0`
     - `k <= 0`
     - `rep >= 60`
     - `n < k`

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the final state in a general form based on the termination conditions.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains `t` (unchanged).
- `n` becomes `0` (or less than `k` if the loop terminates due to `n < k`).
- `k` becomes `0` (or less than `0` if the loop terminates due to `k <= 0`).
- `rep` is the number of iterations that occurred before the loop terminated, which is less than `60`.
- `tab` contains the string representations of the `number` values calculated in each iteration.
- `number` is the last value calculated in the loop.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is reduced to `0` (or less than `k` if the loop terminates due to `n < k`). The variable `k` is reduced to `0` (or less than `0` if the loop terminates due to `k <= 0`). The variable `rep` holds the count of how many times the loop executed, which is less than `60`. The variable `tab` is a list of string representations of the numbers calculated in each iteration, and `number` holds the last number calculated in the loop.

Output State: **t is t, n is 0 or less than k, k is 0 or less, rep is the number of iterations (less than 60), tab is a list of string representations of the numbers calculated, number is the last number calculated.**
