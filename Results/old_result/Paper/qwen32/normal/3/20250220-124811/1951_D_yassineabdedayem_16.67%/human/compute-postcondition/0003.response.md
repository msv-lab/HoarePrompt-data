Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer; `rep` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `rep` has been assigned the value 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
