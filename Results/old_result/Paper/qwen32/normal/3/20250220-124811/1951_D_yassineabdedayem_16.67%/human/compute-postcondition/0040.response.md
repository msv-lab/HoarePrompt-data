The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This code simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Output: **YES**
