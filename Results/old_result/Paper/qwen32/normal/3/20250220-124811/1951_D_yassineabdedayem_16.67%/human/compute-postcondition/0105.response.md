The value of `rep` is changed to `0`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `['3', '2', '1']` if `k` is not `0`, otherwise `tab` is `['3', '2', '1', 'new_element']`, `number` is `1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `['3', '2', '1']` if `k` is not `0`, otherwise `tab` is `['3', '2', '1', 'new_element']`, `number` is `1`.**
