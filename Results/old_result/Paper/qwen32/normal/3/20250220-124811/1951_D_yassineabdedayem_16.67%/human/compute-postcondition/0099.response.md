The loop iterates over the list `tab` and prints each element. Given the initial state and the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate over the entire list `tab`. 

The output states provided indicate that the loop has iterated over the first three elements of `tab` and then added a new element `'new_element'` to the list. However, the loop will only iterate over the elements that were in `tab` at the start of the loop, not the newly added element.

Given the initial `tab` is `['3', '2', '1']` and the loop iterates over each element, the loop will execute exactly 3 times, printing each element in the order they appear in the list.

Since the loop does not modify any variables other than iterating over `tab`, the final output state will be the same as the state after the third iteration, except that the loop will have completed all iterations.

Output State: **t is t-1, n is 0, k is 0, rep is 3, tab is ['3', '2', '1', 'new_element'], number is 1**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the state remains the same as after the third iteration, with `t` still being `t-1`, `n` and `k` both being `0`, `rep` being `3`, `tab` containing `['3', '2', '1', 'new_element']`, and `number` being `1`. The loop will have printed all elements in `tab` up to the point of the third iteration, and no further changes will occur to the variables that are not part of the loop's body.
