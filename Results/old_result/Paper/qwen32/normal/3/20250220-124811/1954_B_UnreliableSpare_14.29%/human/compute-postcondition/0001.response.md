The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

After executing the code, the variable `arr` is introduced and assigned the list of integers read from the input. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
