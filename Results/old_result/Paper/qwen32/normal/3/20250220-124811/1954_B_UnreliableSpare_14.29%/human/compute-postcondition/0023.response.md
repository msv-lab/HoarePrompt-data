The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given that `ans` is initially `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `0`, the updated value of `ans` will be `0`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `ans` is 0; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`**.
