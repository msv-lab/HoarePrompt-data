The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of the variable `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2. After this operation, `cnt` will be 1, 2, or 3 respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is 2; `cnt` is 1, 2, or 3; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity') if `cnt` was 2, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
