You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and the given examples.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if, for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1 \)), if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), then \( a_i \) can be replaced with \( a_{i-1} \) (or \( a_{i+1} \)) to maintain the same value throughout the array. The aim is to find the smallest number of removals required to break this property.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array:**
   - The program checks if the array is uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it immediately prints `-1` because removing any number of elements from a uniform array will still leave it uniform and beautiful.

3. **Finding the Minimum Sequence Length:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of the same element.
   - It keeps track of the minimum length of any such subsequence found.
   - If the array is not uniform, it prints the minimum length of such subsequences.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals:**
   - The program incorrectly identifies the minimum number of removals as the length of the shortest contiguous subsequence of the same element. This is not necessarily the correct approach because removing elements from a longer sequence might still leave a shorter sequence intact, which could still be beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the shortest contiguous subsequence of the same element is `[5]` (length 1), but removing this single element does not make the array non-beautiful since the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful.

2. **Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not uniform. It should consider the structure of the array and the positions of different elements to determine the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
