### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic is as follows:

1. **Check if the entire array is uniform**: The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because no removal can make the array non-beautiful.

2. **Find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to the first element**: If the array is not uniform, the program then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element. This is stored in the variable `ans`.

3. **Output the result**: Finally, it prints `ans` if the array is not uniform, or `-1` if it is.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The program only checks sequences of elements equal to the first element (`arr[0]`). This is not sufficient to determine the minimum sequence length that needs to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The minimum sequence length should be the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array, regardless of which element it is.

### Example:
For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the minimum sequence length of consecutive identical elements is `1` (the sequence `[5]`). However, the program will incorrectly determine it as `3` (the sequence `[3, 3, 3]`).

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum sequence length of consecutive identical elements in the array.

**Correctness: False**
