Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True. The current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.**
