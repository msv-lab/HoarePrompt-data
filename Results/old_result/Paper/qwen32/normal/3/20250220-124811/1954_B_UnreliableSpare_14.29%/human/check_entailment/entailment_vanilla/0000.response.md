Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements using the specified operation. If it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, the output should be -1.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it immediately prints `-1` because a uniform array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.
   - This part is correct since a uniform array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The program then tries to find the minimum length of any contiguous segment of identical elements.
   - It initializes `ans` to infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`) and iterates through the array.
   - It keeps track of the current segment length (`cnt`) and updates `ans` with the minimum segment length found.
   - After the loop, it performs an additional `min(ans, cnt)` to ensure the last segment is considered.

4. **Output Decision:**
   - If the array was uniform, it already printed `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length found.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals:**
  - The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the shortest segment of identical elements.
  - This is not necessarily true. Removing a single element from a segment might not be enough to make the array non-beautiful. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, removing one `3` does not make the array non-beautiful.
  - The correct approach would involve more complex logic to determine the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the array is uniform.
  - However, it does not correctly handle cases where the minimum number of removals is more than one.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It fails to account for the possibility that multiple elements may need to be removed from a segment to break the beautiful property.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly determine the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.
